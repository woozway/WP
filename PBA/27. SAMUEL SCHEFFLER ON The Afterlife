Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Again

METAPHYSICS, MEANING,
AND REASON

SAMUEL SCHEFFLER ON 
The Afterlife

David Edmonds: I’ve just heard from senior sources that Planet
Earth will self-combust in exactly a year from now and all of life will
be destroyed. Sorry to bring you this rather gloomy news. The question
is, can Philosophy Bites now be bothered to transcribe this interview?
Samuel Scheffler, of New York University, will help us reach an answer.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we’re talking about is the afterlife.
I know you don’t believe in the religious afterlife, in which people go to
heaven or hell and carry on existing in some form forever. So what do you
mean by the afterlife?

Samuel Scheffler: I use the term ‘afterlife’ in an
unconventional, perhaps even misleading sense. The afterlife
I’m concerned with is not the personal afterlife—it’s not the
hope or belief that one will continue to live in some form after
one’s death. I’m concerned with what it means for us to think
about the survival of other people after we ourselves have
died. Most of us take it for granted that other people will live
on after we have died. And I refer to that as ‘the afterlife’.

NW: Most of us don’t imagine that other people cease to exist when we
finally lose consciousness.

SS: That’s right. And my thought is that although we don’t
often reflect seriously about that assumption, it plays a
surprisingly significant role in our lives.
NW: But given that our conscious experience will end, why should we
care about things that happen after our death?

SS: The short answer is that we don’t care only about our
own experiences. One way to bring out this point is to imagine
certain things happening after your death and to see how you
now respond to the prospect of those things happening, even
though you know you won’t be there to witness them. It’s easy
to show that there are lots of things that we can imagine
happening after our own deaths that would horrify us now. For
example, you can imagine horrible things happening to people
you care about: you wouldn’t think, ‘Oh, I’m not going to be
around, it doesn’t matter to me.’

NW: Presumably, a way of investigating that would be to imagine a
scenario in which people don’t exist for very long after I die.

SS: Right. Imagine, for example, that you knew that
although you personally would live a long life, say as long a
life as you were going to live anyway, thirty days after your
death the earth would be destroyed in a collision with a giant
asteroid. Let’s bracket questions about how you know this and
whether anybody else knows it. Just imagine that you knew
that this was going to happen. And then think about how this
would affect your thinking and your choices about what to do
with your life now.

NW: It’s quite a profound exercise. Negative utilitarians believe that
the important thing is to reduce as much suffering as possible. So they
might think that if everyone were painlessly removed from existence that
would be a good outcome! For then there would be no more suffering in
the world.

SS: Well, people with certain theoretical commitments
might say that. But I think it would be a minority reaction
among people generally. Most people would find the prospect
that everything was going to be destroyed thirty days after
their own death horrifying. This would partly be because
people they know and care about would be destroyed. So too
would things that they care about: beautiful works of art,
features of the natural environment, practices that they are
attached to and regard as valuable. What this brings out is that
we want the things that we value to be sustained. We want
them to survive. We want them to persist. We are not
indifferent to the destruction of things that we care about.
And the fact that they will be destroyed after we’re dead
doesn’t really change that.

But another question raised by this doomsday scenario is
what we would want to do with our time and how it might
affect our choices about how to live. Suppose I’m a cancer
researcher, or someone whose life’s work is trying to devise
techniques for strengthening bridges so that they will hold up
during an earthquake. If I know that the whole world is going
to be destroyed thirty days after my death, I might find activities
like that pointless, for two reasons. One reason, especially
prominent in the cancer case, is that I don’t necessarily think
that the cure for cancer is going to be found by me, or even in
my lifetime. I think I’m making a small contribution to an
ongoing project that may take a very long time to complete.
Second, I think that the value of the project derives from the
benefits that it will eventually provide to people over a very
long period of time. If the world is going to be destroyed in a
very short period of time, then the point of activities like that
might be considerably reduced. And there are quite a lot of
activities like that—activities whose point, surprisingly, derives
to a great extent from what will happen after we’re dead.

NW: I can see that it would be hard to sustain the motivation to do
cancer research in this scenario. But there is a range of activities: aren’t
there some activities that you would plausibly want to continue?

SS: That’s an excellent question. I’m sure there are some
activities like that, but one has to think through the cases one
by one. The most obviously threatened activities, the ones
most likely to seem pointless under these conditions, are
goal-orientated projects when you don’t expect the goal to be
achieved in the very short term. Those projects would be
rendered pointless, or arguably pointless. And a lot of our
projects are like that.

But there are other things too. For example, I’m a
philosopher. I’m working on a couple of articles at the
moment. The activity of writing a philosophical article is not
goal-orientated in the same way that cancer research is. But
would I still have the motivation to finish writing the article
that I’m working on now if the destruction of humanity were
imminent? I’m not sure that I would. And that’s not because
I expect the article to have a great impact in a 100 years. It has
more to do with some implicit sense that I think of myself as
participating in an ongoing historical enterprise. And if you
cut that enterprise short, then who cares if I finish this article?
It somehow deprives it of the conditions that make it a
sensible-seeming thing to do.

Of course, I’m sure that there would be a lot of variation in
the way people would react to the doomsday scenario. But
I think that the range of activities that we would find
compelling would be drastically reduced—more than we
might think.

NW: Take something like the football world cup. I’m English. Would
I like England to win the very last world cup? Or would the fact that
history wouldn’t record that for very long stop us caring about it!

SS: Sports, and games more generally, have their own rules;
they set up their own criteria of significance. Internally to the
world of a given sport or a given game, some things just
matter. If the world were coming to an end, would they stop
mattering? Maybe not. But to me it doesn’t seem at all obvious
that they would continue to matter as much as before.

NW: Aren’t there some pleasures that are ‘in the moment’, like
listening to music, which wouldn’t be affected by whether or not other
people existed after my death?

SS: That’s a great question. A natural first thought is that
there are certain activities whose rewards are completely
available in the moment, and listening to music is a good
example. It might not seem, at first, as if our capacity to take
pleasure in music should be at all affected by the knowledge
that human beings are dying out.

But on second thought it’s not obvious that this is right.
It may well be that people would find some pleasure or
consolation in listening to music. But the rewards of listening
to music aren’t just brute sensations that have an effect on
us independently of our other mental states. In ordinary
circumstances, it’s a familiar fact that one’s appreciation of
music can be blocked on any given occasion by anxiety, by
preoccupation, by stress. This suggests that even though the
rewards of music appear to be available fully in the moment,
our ability to access these rewards is not independent of
other things going on in our lives. And it’s at least not
self-evident that if one were faced with the prospect of
humanity’s imminent disappearance, one would continue to
find pleasure in listening to music as consistently as one
previously had.

NW: As a parent, I care about what happens to my children. That’s
one of the reasons I sometimes think about what will happen after my
death. I might think about my children’s inheritance or their continuing
happiness, or about what they will do with their future. Is that something
that’s relevant here?

SS: Certainly, one powerful element in our reactions to the
catastrophe scenario we’ve been discussing is that it involves
the sudden horrible death of everyone we care about who will
be alive thirty days after our own death. That is a terrible
prospect; family, friends, children all wiped out in an instant.
And it’s natural to think that that’s the primary source of our
distress in contemplating the scenario. But you can vary the
scenario in ways that eliminate that factor and it still seems
that we would react quite strongly to the prospect.

For example, in her novel The Children of Men, P. D. James
imagines that the human race becomes infertile. When the
novel starts, human beings have been infertile for over
25 years—and so no baby has been born for this period. The
human race is gradually dying out because no new people are
being born. But no one who is already alive has to die any
younger than they otherwise would. And yet it still seems that
the disappearance of humanity under these conditions would
be a profoundly depressing prospect to many people.

NW: Is the philosophical point that by contemplating these scenarios
we reveal to ourselves that things that we do, that seem to be in the
moment, actually have the presumption that other people will continue to
exist and do something in relation to those things in the future?

SS: That’s exactly right. The central philosophical point is
that, to an extent that we rarely recognize, our capacity to find
value in our activities depends on an implicit assumption that
life will go on after we ourselves are gone. Or, to put it more
generally, that we are part of an ongoing historical chain of
lives and generations. And if you cut that chain short in
thought, it suddenly begins to seem that lots of things that we
regard as worth doing no longer seem so clearly worth doing.

NW: I find that fascinating. And the idea sounds plausible. Does it
have implications for how we act now?

SS: I think it does. Or, more fundamentally, it has
implications for how we think now about the future. There
are obviously lots of concerns that people have about the
impact of our activities on future generations of people. Are
we spoiling the environment? Are we destroying the earth’s
atmosphere? There are questions about population size. There
are all kinds of questions about the impact that we and our
activities have on the future. And many people believe that we
don’t give enough weight to the interests of future people in
deciding what we’re going to do now.

But in making that case, it seems that they have to appeal to
some sort of moral obligation. We’re obligated to take into
account the interests of future people. And there are well-
known puzzles about why we should do that and how we
should do it, and about how to think about who the future
people are, and about what we owe to these non-existent
people.

One of the interesting implications of thinking about the
issue in the terms in which I’ve posed it is that it reverses the
order of concern. It’s not that we have a moral obligation to
these powerless, vulnerable, future people, and so we should
impose some burden on ourselves and restrain ourselves in
certain ways for their sake. It’s rather that we desperately
need them to come into existence and to persist. It’s not that
they depend on us—although, of course, they do—but that we
depend on them! Without an ongoing humanity, our capacity
to find value in our own lives would be, if I’m right,
substantially reduced.

NW: The scenarios that you’ve talked about—the doomsday scenario,
of an asteroid hitting the earth, and the P. D. James’ case of humans
gradually dying out because there is no further procreation—these are
short term. But the truth is that humanity won’t last forever. There will be
a point where the sun burns out and humanity dies out. And yet we still
find value in things that we do now. Why does it matter that in your
examples catastrophe happens in a short period of time, when in the long
term the same result will occur?

SS: That’s a fascinating question and poses a real puzzle. I
like to think of this as the Alvy Singer problem, named after a
character in Woody Allen’s movie Annie Hall. Alvy, at age nine,
is taken by his mother to the doctor because he’s refusing to
do his school work on the grounds that the universe is going
to be destroyed some day. The doctor assures Alvy that this
won’t happen for billions of years. And that’s supposed to
convince him that he should go ahead and do his school work.
And yet if I’m right, if it were going to happen in thirty years,
Alvy might have a point. Why is that? Why would it have such
a devastating effect on our capacity to find value in our lives to
know that humanity was going to disappear in the short term
when it doesn’t do that in the long-term case?

There are several possible solutions to this problem. One
natural thought is that there’s rational pressure to standardize
our reactions in the two cases. And there are two different
ways we could standardize them. The Alvy Singer solution is
that we should lose confidence in the value of our activities
now, even if we don’t think the universe will be destroyed for a
long time. The second solution goes in the opposite direction.
We shouldn’t lose confidence in the value of our activities
even in the short-term case; we should apply to that case the
lesson that Alvy’s mother and doctor wanted him to apply to
the long-term case. So those are two possibilities.

But another option is to deny that there really is rational
pressure to standardize our reactions to the two cases. Maybe
there’s some relevant difference between the cases.

NW: What sort of difference could there be?

SS: One thought is that we don’t react strongly to the
eventual disappearance of the human race partly because we
think that someone will find a way around this problem, the
destruction of humanity, somewhere down the road: our
successors will figure out a solution. A different answer is that
we think that the human race has a certain potential and so
long as it survives long enough to achieve most of the values
that it’s capable of achieving, it might not be so terrible any
more if we disappear.

Still another possibility is that our reactions to the long-
term case are simply unreliable. We just don’t know how to
think about things happening in billions of years—it’s not
part of the temporal frame of reference within which we
ordinarily operate. So it’s misleading to compare our reactions
in the short- and long-term cases.

In the end, I’m not sure what the right answer is. But I do
think that it’s an extremely interesting puzzle.
