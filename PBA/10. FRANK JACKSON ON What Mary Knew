Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Again

MIND, SELF, AND
IMAGINATION

FRANK JACKSON ON 
What Mary Knew

David Edmonds: We’re about to introduce you to Mary and a red
tomato. Mary’s an imaginary person living in bizarre circumstances, of
which more anon. Her creator is a distinguished Australian philosopher.
When Frank Jackson dreamed up Mary, it was to use her as an intellectual
weapon against physicalists—those who believe that the only things that
exist in the world are physical. Frank Jackson used to believe there were
mental properties distinct from physical states and properties, and that
these mental properties were epiphenomenal, i.e. they had no influence on
physical states. But back to Mary and what she knew about that tomato . . .

Nigel Warburton: We’re going to talk about a very famous thought
experiment known as ‘What Mary Knew’ or ‘the Knowledge Argument’.
You’re responsible for that thought experiment. Could you begin by
telling us how you came up with it?

Frank Jackson: There’s a bit of history. I used to be at
Monash University, and that was back in the days when nearly
all philosophers of mind were materialists. The Psychology
Department discovered that there was a dualist in the
Philosophy Department and said, in effect, ‘Let’s ask this
dualist over to give us a lunchtime talk and explain how you
could possibly not be a materialist’ (or so I imagine). So, in the
spirit of inter-departmental co-operation, I said, yes, that
sounds like a good idea. But then, of course, I had to think of
something to say. I thought, well, I’ve always felt that the
sensory side of psychology—the feely bit, the pains and the
itches and the tickles and the red sunsets, all that stuff—that
was the bit that materialism couldn’t handle. So I said: right,
I’ll present the psychologists with the best argument for saying
that that gets left out. I just wanted the clearest argument that
would spell out exactly why the feely side got left out. The talk
I gave was an early version of the knowledge argument.
NW: So what was the argument that you came up with?

FJ: Well, the idea that the feely side’s left out is the idea that
if you tell everything there is to tell in physical terms, every-
thing the materialists talk about—brain states and functional
states and information processing and everything that
Artificial Intelligence people discuss—if you say everything
there is to say in those terms, you somehow leave something
out. Now, what’s a good way to make that point? Imagine
someone who knew everything materialists talk about but had
never had an experience of red. Wouldn’t they be ignorant
about something? And that is the idea behind the knowledge
argument.

NW: The knowledge argument is a bit more detailed than that, isn’t
it? It’s not just a matter of imagining someone who hasn’t had experience
of red, but of somebody who has had a completely monochromatic
experience up to that point.

FJ: Yes. You imagine a woman who is confined to a black-and-
white room. She is painted black and white. She never cuts her
hands, so she’s never seen any red blood. The room is full of
books in black and white. The TV is black and white, and she
watches wonderful lectures by the world’s greatest neurosci-
entists on it—all in black and white. That’s all inside the room.
She’s never been outside the room. She’s called Mary. Mary
becomes the world’s greatest functional psychologist and
neuroscientist: she’s also an expert on physics and chemistry,
etc., but she’s never had the experience of something looking
red to her. You open the door and you let her go out. Won’t
she say: ‘My goodness, there’s a whole aspect of reality which
I didn’t know about’? That’s the knowledge argument: you
can know all there is to know that can be given in black-and-
white terms, and yet somehow there’s something missing,
there’s something more to know. But, of course, all there is to
know that can be given in black-and-white terms includes
everything in materialists’ account of the mind, so what’s in
their account is incomplete.

NW: Now, when she does go out of the room, philosophers usually
describe the experience she has as her experience of ‘qualia’.

FJ: Yes. The basic thought is that she learns something
exciting about what the world is like. Being philosophers we
want a nice label for this, and the word ‘qualia’ is just a nice
label for it. It’s a word for the feely side of looking red and,
more generally, the feely side of psychology.

NW: But in the thought experiment, there shouldn’t be anything extra
because she knows absolutely everything that you could possibly know
about neuropsychology. So she should not be surprised in the least.

FJ: If physicalism is true, the line of thought in the argument
is that she shouldn’t be surprised at all. And, of course, she
does know, while she’s inside the room, that people use the
word ‘red’ on occasion. She reads in her black-and-white
books that people say things like ‘Sunsets look red’, and they
say things like ‘The experience of red is rather more vivid and
exciting than the experience of pale grey.’ She knows all that.
But the thought is there’s something she doesn’t know: she
doesn’t actually know the nature of the state which underlies
those remarks she reads about. I hasten to add, of course, that
I no longer believe the conclusion of the thought experiment.
I’m now a card-carrying materialist—but that’s a later part of
the story.

NW: Let’s just get to the conclusion that you wanted to deliver when
you first gave this paper. You described the thought experiment and
presumably there was a punch line?

FJ: Well, the punch line was that what she learns about are
extra properties; and the conclusion was that physicalism is
false. But I also said we know enough about how the world
works to say that these extra properties don’t do any causing.
To use the philosopher’s jargon, they’re epiphenomenal. So,
that’s the reason the original paper was called ‘Epiphenom-
enal Qualia’, because the idea is that we’ve got to believe in
these qualia, but we also have to say, as good scientists, that
they’re epiphenomenal: the extra properties don’t affect the
words that come out of my mouth, or the movements of my
hand, or what goes on in my brain.

NW: Just to get this straight, what you’re saying is that, although I
might have these experiences, I can describe brain states and muscular
changes and physiological reactions, and so on, in my body without any
need to bring in these qualia to explain what’s going on?

FJ: If you ask neuroscientists to explain what happens in our
brain and how those happenings lead to changes in our vocal
chords and movements in our arms and so on, they never have
to invoke anything outside entities and properties they deal
with in the neuroscience laboratory.

NW: I can’t believe the materialists just rolled over when they heard
your argument. What kind of counterarguments did they come up with?

FJ: A very large number. The literature is enormous. And, as
I often say, although lots of materialists thought there was
some obvious error in the argument, I was somewhat
consoled by the fact that there was a great deal of disagree-
ment over what that obvious error was. So it cannot have been
that obvious. But, yes, they came up with lots of counterargu-
ments. They also said epiphenomenalism is unbelievable. And
indeed that was the consideration that eventually made me
change my mind.

NW: So why did you change your mind?

FJ: Well, the biggest factor was the picture of myself writing
‘Epiphenomenal Qualia’ but not being caused to write
‘Epiphenomenal Qualia’ by qualia. I said in ‘Epiphenomenal
Qualia’ that you had to be an epiphenomenalist about qualia,
and what that meant was that qualia didn’t cause the words
that came out of my mouth or the movement of my pen
on pieces of paper when I wrote the article (this was back in
the early 1980s). So that meant that, when I gave the talk
defending epiphenomenal qualia, and when I wrote the
paper defending epiphenomenal qualia, qualia weren’t causing
the talk and they weren’t causing the writing. I decided that
this was unbelievable. Now, of course, ‘Epiphenomenal
Qualia’ does have a section which says that you can live with
epiphenomenalism, with replies to the standard arguments
against epiphenomenalism. It also says it’s perfectly reasonable
to believe that the world is a much more mysterious place than
you might have thought, and that one of the mysteries are these
epiphenomenal qualia. But I came to think that this section was
a triumph of philosophical cleverness over common sense.

NW: Epiphenomenal things don’t do anything. That is the essence of
epiphenomenal entities: they don’t actually have causal power. So it
shouldn’t surprise you that they’re not doing anything.

FJ: Oh no, it shouldn’t surprise you at all. It’s just a bit awkward
to see how you can know about them, and, indeed, how you can
remember them when you’re not seeing anything red, and insist
in a lecture that the experience of red isn’t captured in the
physicalist world scheme. You’re remembering the experience of
red and the memory is caused by—well, not by the property
you’re seeking to tell people about at the lecture—but by purely
physical goings-on in your brain and its surroundings. And that
was the consideration that eventually made me abandon the
argument. The other thing that happened is that I became much
more sympathetic to representationalism about perceptual
experience—the idea that when you have, for example, a colour
experience, there’s a sense in which there’s nothing coloured ‘in’
your experience: what’s happening is that you’re in a state which
represents the world as being a certain way. And if you think
about experience that way, then you can see how you might
respond to the Mary argument.

NW: Well does that mean that you would respond by saying that, actually,
if Mary genuinely did have full knowledge she wouldn’t be surprised?

FJ: Yes. What you would say is two things. First of all, she
wouldn’t be surprised in the sense that she wouldn’t learn
anything new about what the world is like. She’d be surprised
in the sense in which people who are motion-blind and later
acquire the ability to see motion would be surprised. They
wouldn’t think they’ve discovered a new property, but if
you’re motion-blind, things don’t seem to move. You know
there’s motion but nothing has that—sort of—‘left-to-right’,
say, look about it, and you can’t even imagine what it’s like to
see motion. And it’s no use having someone give you a lecture
telling you what it’s like to see motion—that’s a waste of time.
You still won’t know what it’s like to see motion. And when
you subsequently see it, there is a surprise. You come to know
what it’s like to see motion. But it’s not, in any sense, an
acquaintance with a new property. So I think what the
representationalists can say about what happens to Mary
when she leaves the room is that she’s not surprised in the
sense of learning about a new property but, of course, she’s
surprised in the sense that she now knows what it’s like to see
red, in the same sense in which someone who’s motion-blind
does when they get the ability to see motion—they suddenly
know what it’s like to see motion.

NW: Once you’d published this as a paper, what kind of reaction did
you get?

FJ: Well, a lot of it was hostile—in the philosophical sense,
I don’t mean in the personal sense. But there were always a
group of people, of course, that were very enthusiastic about
the argument. And I meet them at conferences, now I’ve
changed my mind, and they often come up to me and say,
‘We’re very sorry you’ve changed your mind.’ I think they feel
that I’ve let the side down. There have been books devoted to
the argument and nothing but the argument, and if you look
at citation counts, many of the papers on the knowledge
argument are cited a lot.

NW: It would be interesting to know how long it took you to come up
with the argument. Was it something that just occurred to you in a minute?

FJ: I’d read H.G. Wells’ book The Country of the Blind, and,
as you may know, in that book there’s a sighted person who
lives in the country of the blind. The people who are blind
don’t believe he is that different from them. They notice he’s
rather good at winning fights and avoiding falling down holes
but they think this is just a behavioural capacity. There’s
nothing else going on except this rather interesting behav-
ioural capacity. I think that book might have triggered the
thought experiment because I thought, ‘Hold on, this is quite
wrong! This isn’t just a behavioural capacity; he has access to a
whole range of properties and experiences that the blind
people don’t have access to—they don’t know about them.’
But, of course, I was also influenced by the long history of
controversy over exactly what it is that people who are blind
or colour-blind lack, and by the paper by Paul Meehl I cite in
‘Epiphenomenal Qualia’.

NW: Now that you’re back in the world of materialism, are you
still left with that mysterious feeling about consciousness and
conscious experience that inspires many people to get worked up
about qualia in the first place?

FJ: I’ve done a reasonably good job of disinfecting myself
from my previous opinions, but what I do think, though, is that
lots of people who reply to the knowledge argument don’t
really explain what is wrong with it. They say lots of really
interesting, philosophically illuminating things but somehow
leave one dissatisfied. Somehow, the redness of reds isn’t
covered. And the reason I like the representationalist approach
is that I think it does allow you to say: ‘Look, the redness of
reds is not a property of your experience. It’s a property of the
way you’re representing the world to be. So don’t think of
the redness as some sort of property of a state of you; it’s a
property that you are ascribing to the world around you. Your
visual system is—sort of—shouting out to you, “These objects
have got an attention-grabbing vivid property”, but don’t think
that your experience has this property.’

NW: Does that mean that I can be having an experience which I call
‘red’ but you would call ‘green’ if you were having it, and vice versa?

FJ: Yes. I think it’s obviously true that different people might
have very different colour experiences. Indeed, if we imagine
discovering a tribe in the Amazon jungle whose brains are
systematically transposed with respect to ours in the states
crucial to having colour experiences, and who have, as it
seems to us, rather curious views about which colours go
together, I think we might well say: ‘My goodness, when they
see ripe tomatoes their colour experiences are like those we
have when we see grass, and when they see grass, their
experiences are like those we have when we look at ripe
tomatoes.’ And perhaps they say things like: ‘Ripe tomatoes
are rather soothing whereas grass is rather attention-grabbing,
like the sound of a trumpet.’ If something like this happened,
I think we’d say that they have transposed colour experiences.
So I think we should acknowledge that as a possibility. What
the materialist has to say, of course, is that at some level—
functional, or behavioural, or neuroscientific—you could detect
this difference. Indeed, the story I’ve just told you is a story
where you can do the detecting.

NW: How could you tell that these people were having transposed
experiences?

FJ: Well, I think it would be a combination of three things.
You look at their brains and you discover that what happens in
their brains when they see ripe tomatoes is like what happens
in our brains when we see grass. You also find out exactly
which optical properties of the surfaces of objects they are
responding to and you discover that the particular properties
their visual system responds to when they look at ripe
tomatoes isn’t the property we respond to; it is some associ-
ated property, more like the property of grass which stimu-
lates our responses. And, finally, they’d be behavioural and
functional properties to do with how they discriminated one
object from another. But I do think that if you found
two groups of people who were behaviourally and neurophysiologically
and information-processing identical, then
you would have to say they have the same experiences.

NW: You’ve described how you’ve changed your opinion about the right
conclusion to draw from your thought experiment. Is there any chance you
might flip again and go back the other way and say: ‘Well, look, actually, I was
wrong about physicalism. Dualism is the correct explanation of our state’?

FJ: No, I don’t think so. Since I became a convert to the
representationalist picture of the nature of experience, since
then, I think I’m bulletproof or iron-clad—or whatever the
right phrase is—against sliding back. Which is perhaps a good
thing. It would be slightly embarrassing to change my mind,
yet again, on the subject.
