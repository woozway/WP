Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Again

MIND, SELF, AND
IMAGINATION

PATRICIA CHURCHLAND ON
Eliminative Materialism

David Edmonds: There’s a tradition in philosophy, which started in
Oxford post-World War II, that insists that to understand mental concepts
like belief, or free will, or memory, or desire, we just need to analyse how
the concepts are actually used in everyday language. Some people refer to
the set of commonly held views about these psychological states as ‘folk
psychology’. Pat Churchland, who’s based at the University of San Diego,
is a well-known and contentious critic of folk psychology. With her
husband, Paul, she works on the relationship between neuroscience and
philosophy. She says that we can’t approach folk psychology uncritically;
folk psychology can be wrong. As we learn more and more about the brain,
we’ll need to modify some of our concepts, and even eliminate them.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we’re going to talk about today is
eliminative materialism. Now, to somebody outside philosophy, that’s just
gobbledegook: so what is it?

Pat Churchland: The idea of eliminative materialism is
really quite simple. When Paul Churchland and I were
thinking about the nature of mental states and how they
relate to brain states, we were motivated to look at the history
of science. One of the things that you can see in the history of
science is that there is a progression, and you see it in
chemistry, in physics, in biology, whereby certain old concepts
get replaced or modified or amplified by new developments in
science. So, for example, in the context of Newtonian physics,
the old idea of impetus got thrown out as explanatorily useless.
The concept of element was massively modified and amplified
as chemistry became a science; ditto for gene as molecular
biology became a science. One of the questions that we
wanted to ask was this: as neurobiology comes to interweave
with higher-level concepts, what will those higher concepts
look like? Will they look like folk psychology as it has always
been, or will there be fundamental changes? We made a
prediction that there’s likely to be change, and in that sense we
were talking about elimination.

NW: So, the eliminative bit is the idea that you get rid of something.
The materialist bit is that the brain is a physical thing, and that’s
basically what we, as thinking beings, are: physical things.

PC: Yes. The materialism part of the story is certainly not
new with us. The hypothesis that all mental states, including
states of consciousness, thoughts, ideas, beliefs, desires,
motivations, are all states of the physical brain has increasingly
been supported by developments in neuroscience, so that
right now, there’s very little evidence for the view that there is
a non-physical substance, a kind of spooky thing, or ethereal
thing, that does the thinking and the feeling and the
remembering, and so forth: it looks like these are all part of
the physical brain itself. So that’s the materialist part of the
story. As you say, the eliminativist part of the story was a
prediction, a prediction that certain concepts might be
modified, developed, might even be eliminated as
neuroscience progressed.

NW: Could you give an example of a concept of folk psychology?

PC: The concepts that we use in everyday explanations of
ourselves and of others, concepts having to do with beliefs,
desires, intentions. I think the notion of having a goal is part
of folk psychology, but I think that’s one of the concepts that’s
likely to be retained as a high-level psychological concept that
really does fit quite well with neurobiological findings.
Another concept of folk psychology is the will. There
certainly is something that’s different between somebody
whom we describe as having ‘strong will’ and somebody we
describe as being ‘weak-willed’, but there isn’t a thing in there
that is ‘the will’. What we find is a whole lot of circuitry,
poorly understood at this point, that, in various ways,
regulates decision making. But ‘will’ is sometimes thought of
as comparable to a muscle, and there’s nothing in there that’s
like a muscle. In the case of memory, for example, prior to
about 1950, people generally thought of memory as a single,
unified function. We know now that there are different parts
of the nervous system that handle quite different functions
that used to be called memory. Remembering how to ride a
bicycle is a very different function, and relies on quite different
circuitry than remembering your mother’s name. It turns out
that the concept of memory actually fractionates into many
different sub-types, each of which is regulated by rather
different pathways.

NW: Is this a bit like the way in which the concept ‘melancholy’ has
changed? For Elizabethans, the concept of melancholy was quite different
from our concept of depression: it could be a creative malady, it had
certain causes, in the levels of bile, or whatever explanations were given
then, and now we’ve more or less eliminated that concept of melancholy,
and have this different, more medical concept of depression?

PC: It is rather similar to that. Another example would be
the notion of demonic possession. In our culture, we forget
how recent the idea of demonic possession was. Consider
Huntingdon’s disease, in which there is a decline of regulation
of motor function, as well as cognitive function, and people
make all kinds of movements that they don’t, as it were,
intend. It used to be thought of as demonic possession. We
now realize that is completely wrong. That’s an example of
outright elimination, as opposed to modification.

NW: You have this hypothesis that various folk psychological concepts
will be eliminated as neuropsychology, and neurobiology progress: what
does that mean for philosophy, because there are some styles of doing
philosophy where people sit in an armchair and reflect on the concepts
that they happen to have? Are they misguided in doing that?

PC: Conceptual analysis, which has had its heyday in Oxford,
really from the mid-1950s onwards, was sustained by the idea
that you could find out about the nature of something merely
by reflecting in your own mind on the relationships between
various concepts, so that you could do it all in an a priori way.
An American philosopher, Willard Van Orman Quine,
suggested that while it’s very useful on some occasions to
reflect on the meaning of your concepts, the more important
question for asking about the nature of things is whether those
concepts truly apply to the phenomenon in question. That is
what I’m interested in. I’m not so much interested in how
people talk about the phenomenon: I really want to know
whether those concepts truly apply to phenomena in the brain
and in the world. When it comes to understanding perception,
decision making, and choice, what it is to be a self, and to be
conscious, I’m not so much interested in what you might mean
by these things, but rather I want to know whether those
concepts, rough and ready as they are, apply to the
phenomenon in question. I want to know about the nature of
things, and this is a very old philosophical preoccupation. I feel
that I would have had a lot in common with Aristotle, with
John Locke—who, after all, performed dissections—and with
David Hume. Increasingly, philosophers are becoming sensitive
to the fact that if they want to understand something such as
perception, they need to pay attention to both the
psychological and neurophysiological results of perception.
Here’s a really interesting fact: very, very early in the process of
visual perception—in early visual cortex, that is in the first area
in the visual cortex to which visual signals are sent (V1), there
is valuation. We know this because there are projections from
higher areas of the brain all the way back to V1 that attach a
value signal to this perceptual signal rather than that one. So
when philosophers say, ‘But you must separate fact and value’,
we say, wait: an interesting feature of the brain is that before
we’re even conscious of a visual perception, it comes with a
valence. Your brain merges fact and value in deciding what to
pay attention to.

NW: So you’re suggesting that babies in the act of perception, are at
the same time preferring one thing to another, that’s the valuation: they
attach some kind of qualitative aspect to this, even though they may not
be aware of it themselves?

PC: Absolutely. And learning and being rewarded by
interacting with a particular stimulus, the mother, the breast,
means that when the baby has a certain smell, or certain visual
perception, that already comes to the baby’s conscious
awareness, as having a ‘pro’ value. So the separation of fact
and value is something that is highly sophisticated, comes
relatively late in cognitive development, and we have to be
taught that distinction when we do science. This is a very
important point, especially in thinking about morality, where
philosophers want to assume that the mind has facts, and then
value has to come from something else, namely rules. If you
look at the nervous system, that is not the way much of
valuation happens.

NW: Does this mean that philosophers have to be scientists?

PC: I think there is a very particular role for philosophers:
it’s not to just, as we used to say in San Diego, ‘pull it out of
your ass’. The more productive strategy is to connect in a
very meaningful way with the range of data that is relevant
to your question. You could think of the job for philosophers
as analogous to the role of theoretical physicists who may,
but need not engage in experiments, but who draw upon a
very broad range of experiments to try and get a coherent
hypothesis about how something works. I think you might
say the same thing about certain kinds of philosophical
questions, questions about decision making and choice. It’s
no good just sitting in your office thinking about it. What you
need to do is find out what we know about suppressing
impulses, about discounting the value for rewards expected
in the future, about the role of motivation and choice,
about attention, about valuation and perception, that
make decision making look the way it is. That means, in
addition to a scientific enterprise which is largely vertical—
deeper and deeper into the system on a particular problem—
the philosopher can have a scientific programme which is
horizontal. That programme reaches across many labs, across
many projects, across many sub-disciplines to try to
synthesize and integrate diverse data together in a useful way
to sketch a Big Picture. Now, the hypothesis you frame with
has to be testable: it’s not very interesting if it’s true by
definition. Sometimes—most of the time, perhaps—you’re
going to get it wrong. And when you get it wrong, what
you’re not going to say is, ‘But this is my position which I
defend.’ What you say is, ‘OK, let’s modify the hypothesis in
light of the data.’

NW: Let’s take that example of decision making. You could find out
all these facts about how people make decisions, and make scientific
hypotheses about how decisions are actually instantiated in the brain. But
what’s the role for a philosopher in this whole world of understanding
decisions?

PC: One of the things we would particularly like to
understand is how it is that one desire can be given free rein,
and the other suppressed. You can say, if you just reflect in
your own mind ‘Well, I do it by exercising my will’, but we
want to know how that really happens, relative to the data
that are available now. You could frame a hypothesis about
how that happens. What you’d have to do is draw very
broadly on data from many projects and you have to talk
about it in terms of pathways and interactions and so forth.
You would develop a computational model, which may or
may not turn out to be true.

NW: There is a sense in which we need these concepts, the folk
psychology of our age, to talk about our relationships with other people:
we’re stuck with these, we’re brought up with these concepts. We’re not
going to jettison them just because somebody makes a discovery in
neuroscience.

PC: No, that’s quite true. Let me make two points, but let
me frame those points by saying something about what
I mean by a high-level concept. Having a goal, for example, is
a high-level concept, and we think that that can be instantiated
in a very specific way in circuitry in the brain stem and the
limbic system. So the high-level description refers to the
behaviour description, and the low-level description would be
in terms of neural activity. Now, there’s no question that we
need high-level concepts. We certainly need to have concepts
like ‘X has a goal’, or ‘X is maintaining his goal, despite
distractions’—we say that with regard to rats and mice, and
babies. The other point really is that there’s no question of
replacing the high-level concepts that we use from folk
psychology until we have a good science to replace them with.
(I made this point clearly in 1986 in Neurophilosophy, but many
philosophers like to assume I did not.) So a concept like trust
or attachment turns out to be extremely important in
describing the behaviour, not only of humans with regard to
their offspring and with regard to their mates and their
friends, but also for rats and monkeys and baboons and
chimpanzees. Additionally, we know now something about
the circuitry and the neurochemicals that regulate bonding
and trusting behaviour. So trust is a useful high-level concept.
It may get refined and revised as we know yet more, but it’s a
high-level concept that meshes very beautifully with what we
know at the physiological level. Now, there are certain other
concepts where we don’t know how it’s going to work out.
Concepts like beliefs are problematic because some beliefs are
things that are forefront in our minds as a sentence, such as,
‘I believe you are wearing a pair of glasses’; others are in the
background of our knowledge. Beliefs are not stored in the
brain as sentences—we can be sure of that—so how to
characterize them in neurobiological terms remains puzzling.
Moreover, many non-verbal animals know things, so what
they know will have to be described in some way that does not
imply they have language. Finally, notice that whether people
in general, apart from science, adopt a new vocabulary
depends on how useful it is for them. It was never part of our
agenda to say, ‘people must change how they talk’. We’re very
easy-going about that, but what we want to know is how
things really are.

NW: I was just thinking, when you were saying that, of the way that
people use the phrase ‘left brain’ and ‘right brain’ now. It’s very crude, but
it’s a way of understanding patterns of behaviour, which would have
been completely alien 50 years ago.

PC: I think that’s right, and it is rather remarkable how
easily people picked that up, muddled though it was. The idea
of being ‘frontal’ is now really becoming very common, so
that when someone shows a tendency to be poor in impulse
control, to be poor in maintaining a goal, to be easily
persuadable by rather goofy ideas, they’re often spoken of as
being ‘frontal’. That’s because within the neurological
domain, frontality involving lesions within frontal structures
is associated with executive dysfunction.

NW: I know when you first wrote about eliminative materialism, you
had some quite strong reactions; this is a radical hypothesis and it
annoyed some people.

PC: Well, we didn’t think the hypothesis was radical at all.
We thought it was obvious that folk psychology, this sort of
ancient bumbling, in many ways incoherent, in many ways
inconsistent, but a beloved thing, will change. But there was a
certain wilful misunderstanding on the part of philosophers.
Some philosophers were terrified by the idea that the sciences
of psychology, neuroscience, economics, and so forth, were
going to have to play a role in philosophy, and that they
needed to think about hypotheses, rather than a priori truths.
We were caricatured as supposing that beliefs were nothing
other than the firing of neurons in the basal ganglia, and
I think we were largely written off. We were Americans, we
didn’t speak the fancy English that people did in Oxford, we
were saying the game needed to change if progress were to be
made. I don’t really know the sociological explanation for why
our approach was so vilified, but clearly we were written off.
There were occasions when I would give a talk, and someone
in the question period would stand up and very aggressively
say, ‘You’re not doing philosophy any more, why are you even
here, why are you even speaking, claiming to be a
philosopher?’ We just got used to it, and we don’t care that
much. What I’m interested in is finding things out. If there are
people who would rather just sit and talk about what they
think rationality is without knowing anything, far be it for me
to complain.
