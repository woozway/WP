Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Again

POLITICS

SUSAN MENDUS ON 
Toleration

David Edmonds: At the core of liberalism is the idea of tolerance:
individuals and groups should be allowed to live as they see fit. The state
should tolerate people of all beliefs and all lifestyles, so long as other
people are not harmed as a result. But what justification is there for this
degree of tolerance? Should we tolerate everything and everyone? Why?
Merely because doing so might help keep the peace? Or does tolerance have
a moral basis independent of its consequences? Won’t tolerance lead to
the Balkanization of society—separate communities with irreconcilable
values? Such questions are coming under intense political scrutiny, with
many politicians, such as the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel,
claiming that the multicultural experiment has failed. Susan Mendus,
a leading theorist on tolerance, put up with our gentle grilling.

Nigel Warburton: We’re focusing on the question ‘Why be tolerant?’
Some people talk about ‘toleration’, some people talk about ‘tolerance’, do
you have a preference for either word?

Susan Mendus: Well, some people say that ‘tolerance’
is most properly applied to individuals, whereas ‘toleration’ is
most properly applied to political systems or governments.
But I use these terms interchangeably.

NW: Ok then, what is toleration?

SM: Standardly, toleration is defined as allowing, permitting,
or refraining from interfering with something which you
believe to be morally wrong. So, if you behave in a way which
I think is morally bad, but I don’t prevent you from doing the
thing that I think is bad, that counts as tolerating. Of course,
underwriting all of that must also be the possibility that I could
stop you if I wanted to. So the ingredients are these: I need to
have the power to stop you, and I need to refrain from stopping
you, and I need to think that what you’re doing is wrong.

NW: Toleration is very much at the heart of politics. We have to
understand how we can live together, and an aspect of that has to be
ascertaining the limits of toleration.

SM: That’s right; we have to live together whilst we have
different ideas about what’s the best way to live. That’s what
lies at the heart of the problem of toleration. There are two
questions that arise which are then absolutely crucial.

First, ‘Why might we be tolerant?’ As a society, or as a
government; why might a government tolerate homosexuality,
atheism, Catholicism? These are all real examples of cases
where toleration has been very vexed.

Second, ‘What are the limits of that toleration?’ Because,
however tolerant a government, it’s not going to be tolerant of
everything, nor would we want it to be tolerant of everything.
I take it we wouldn’t want the government to be tolerant of
rapists, or murderers, or terrorism. So toleration has got to
have its limits.

NW: Isn’t the answer going to vary from case to case? How are we
going to have a general theory of toleration if there’s such a wide range of
things that are up for consideration as possible candidates for toleration?

SM: There are really two questions there. One is about
whether the answer will be different for different cases.
Another is a question about the range of cases that
there’ll be.

Will the answer be different in different cases? Well, a lot of
the history of political philosophy is a history of trying to find
one answer. If we go back to the seventeenth century, and
John Locke’s Letter Concerning Toleration, Locke’s big ambition
is to give a principled reason for tolerating people of different
religious convictions.

Locke says that in many cases people tolerate not because
they think it is right to do so, but simply in order to keep the
political peace. Locke, however, is looking for a principled
reason for tolerating. He is looking for a single principle of
toleration. That’s very ambitious, and I don’t think he fully
succeeds in that ambition.

Then you’ve got a second question: historically, most
questions of toleration were questions of religious toleration.
That’s where questions of toleration arose in the Western
liberal tradition—as in the wars of religion in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries, when people were killing each
other furiously for religious reasons.

So even if it’s possible to provide a single answer to the
question, ‘Why be tolerant as far as religion is concerned?’,
it may be that that isn’t going to give us an answer to the
question, ‘Why be tolerant with regard to sexuality, or
pornography or blasphemy?’

NW: So what was John Locke’s answer to the question, ‘Why should
we tolerate people with different religions?’

SM: There’s no consensus on the answer, but there are two
strong candidates. One very familiar and very powerful
argument is an argument from irrationality. Locke’s answer is
that, in the case of religious belief, what really matters is that
each individual believes the right thing to secure salvation.
And in that context Locke then says that no amount of political
coercion can compel you to believe the right thing. He says that
fire and the sword are the weapons available to the state, to
politics, but fire and the sword will not change your mind.

So it’s irrational for magistrates, for politicians, to try to
compel people to believe, or to persecute those who don’t
believe the right thing, because persecuting people isn’t going
to change their mind.

Another connected thought is that, in any case, trying to
interfere with religious belief is not the business of politics.
Locke makes a very clear distinction between politics on the
one hand and religion on the other. He says that the magis-
trate is concerned with outward things: how you behave in the
world, whether you obey the law, whether you conduct
yourself properly, whether you’re a good citizen. Religion is a
more inward matter and nothing to do with the magistrate.

So it’s two thoughts: the magistrate cannot change your
mind; and even if he could, he would be doing the wrong
thing—he’d be interfering.

NW: That makes Locke sound very much like a modern liberal. But
weren’t Catholics and atheists excluded from his account of toleration?

SM: Yes. Locke is the father of modern liberalism. But it’s true
that, notoriously, he does not extend toleration to Catholics and
atheists. He does not extend tolerance to atheists because he
thinks that since they believe in no God their promises cannot
be relied upon. It’s a kind of Dostoevskian point: if God is dead,
anything is possible—people who don’t believe in God will do
anything. In Locke’s day, atheism was a very suspect and radical
position to hold.

His position on Catholics is even more interesting; the
reason Locke is suspicious of Catholics is because, he says,
they muddle together the political and the religious. They bear
allegiance to a foreign power, namely the pope. And the pope
is a political and a religious power. Locke’s thought is that, in
so far as they think of the pope as a political power, we should
be suspicious of them too because they confuse things that
should be kept separate.

NW: I can see parallels there between Locke’s age and ours; in Islam
there are clearly connections between the political and the religious.

SM: That’s right. It’s one of the problems in any multicul-
tural, multiracial, multi-faith society, where people with very
different understandings of the relationship between politics
and religion must nevertheless try to live together in some-
thing that looks like harmony.

NW: That brings us to the twenty-first century. We’ve talked about the
seventeenth century and John Locke’s position, but where are we now as
regards toleration?

SM: As I said, Locke is really the father of liberalism. So the
liberalism that we have now in the twenty-first century is a
liberalism that’s been handed down to us through the years.
And I suppose its most famous modern advocate is the
American political theorist John Rawls. He advances a theory
of toleration in his 1993 book, Political Liberalism.

The starting point of Rawls’ political liberalism is the claim
that the aims of political philosophy depend on the society it
addresses. Modern society is characterized by what Rawls calls
the fact of pluralism. That’s to say, societies like Britain, the
United States, western liberal democracies generally, are
suffused with people who have very different understandings
of the best way to lead one’s life. There are atheists, there are
Muslims, there are Catholics, there are hedonists, there are
jazz saxophonists, there are sports people, there are all kinds
of different people with different understandings of the best
way to lead one’s life.

And this pluralism is not going to go away, Rawls says. It is a
permanent fact—and what’s more, we shouldn’t be sorry about
it. Rawls doesn’t believe that in an ideal world we would all
converge on a single truth about, say, religion. Rawls thinks
plurality is the natural outcome of the operation of reason
under conditions of freedom. So he thinks it’s to be celebrated
that when we all think about religion we’ll come up with
different answers. We shouldn’t regret the fact that in the world
there are lots of people who think very differently from us.

NW: But even if diversity is inevitable, does Rawls believe that we
should tolerate views that we think are false?

SM: This is the central question, it seems to me. One
important answer is that we should allow people to do things
which we believe to be wrong because it’s important that they
should lead their own life in their own way. That’s the answer
that John Stuart Mill gives: it’s important that you cut your
suit from your own cloth and not from cloth that I’ve given
you. This thought appeals to what’s commonly known as the
autonomy of individuals; you should make your own mis-
takes, and lead your life the way you want to because that has
a value in itself, even if it’s wrong.

But another thought which is more closely Rawls’ thought
is that the diversity of opinion doesn’t imply that all except
one opinion is wrong. He seems to think that it’s quite
possible that there be a variety of very different views about
the way to lead one’s life. There is no single right answer to
the question, ‘Which way should you lead your life?’

Here’s an example: suppose you are a Quaker and you have a
belief in and are committed to a simple life: no ornament, no
decoration, with being self-effacing. There are many virtues
associated with such a life. But these are not virtues that are going
to lead to artistic glory or that will deliver Florence. This is a point
that’s made in the film of The Third Man. On the Ferris wheel in
The Third Man, Orson Welles’ character says, ‘In Florence, there
were hundreds of years of bloodshed and murder, and that gave
us the Renaissance. In Switzerland, we had 500 years of peace and
tranquillity, and what did that give us? The Cuckoo Clock.’

There’s a serious point behind that: certain virtues are
compatible with certain ways of life, but not with all good
ways of life. If you want artistic splendour, and the glories of
the Renaissance, then you have to have people who are grand,
and proud, and arrogant, and profligate, and overweening.
And Rawls’ thought is that the Quakers and the Renaissance
Florentines exhibit very different virtues. But there’s no simple
answer to the question, ‘Which is the right way to lead your
life?’, because we don’t want a world that’s full of Quakers,
nor one that’s full of Medicis.

NW: So far, we’ve talked about why we should be tolerant—and we’ve
presented various views, including Mill’s, that individuals should shape
their own lives, and Rawls’, that there’s more than one way of deciding
between the different ways of living, so we should just accept that and
tolerate diversity. Does that exhaust the spectrum of views on toleration?

SM: Well, we’re discussing arguments for toleration that
think of it as a moral good and not just something that’s
pragmatic or expedient. Let’s return to John Locke. Before
Locke, there are philosophers who say tolerance is important
because otherwise there’ll be riots in the streets. So you put
up with atheists or Catholics for a bit of peace and tranquillity.
But Locke is the father of liberalism because he thinks that
there are moral reasons for doing this, and Rawls carries on
that tradition. Rawls thinks that it’s morally important to
tolerate others.

And so within political liberalism, toleration isn’t just what
Rawls calls a modus vivendi. It’s not just a way of muddling
along together. It’s a moral belief that we owe it to others to
allow them to lead their lives in their own way.

NW: That’s interesting because when the German chancellor, Angela
Merkel, says ‘multiculturalism has failed’, she presumably means that it
hasn’t worked as a pragmatic solution for groups to rub along side by side;
it hasn’t produced a peaceful outcome free of riots and conflict. But that’s
not what you’re talking about—which is the moral obligation to respect
other people’s autonomy and to give them space to develop their thoughts
and ideas about how to lead their lives.

SM: Yes. I’m unclear what politicians mean when they say
that multiculturalism ‘hasn’t worked’. Some people think
that for multiculturalism to ‘work’, we must end up with
everybody thinking roughly the same—there must be
assimilation of some sort. Rawls’ thought is the reverse of
that. It is that we aren’t going to reach consensus, and that’s a
good thing. The best society that we can aim for is the society
in which people retain their different and conflicting concep-
tions of the good, and where we respect the conceptions of
the good that other people have, even though they aren’t ours.

NW: Why should you respect a different conception of the good? Surely,
all you need to do is tolerate their beliefs? Respect seems to go further and
imply that you think what they’re saying is somehow valuable.

SM: It doesn’t seem to me that I need to withhold respect
from everybody who has what I take to be the wrong answer;
otherwise, I wouldn’t respect many people at all. So it’s
inherent in a liberal society that we recognize that the world is
full of people who have different and incompatible beliefs
from us. But nonetheless, we respect their right to hold those
beliefs.

Of course, you can’t respect absolutely everything that
people do: Locke and Rawls are both clear about this. Toler-
ation has its limits. As I said at the beginning, we won’t
tolerate murderers, rapists, terrorists, or thieves. And then, of
course, the 64-dollar question kicks in; where are the limits
of toleration?

NW: You’re obviously committed to toleration. Presumably there have
been times when the British government hasn’t been as tolerant as you
would like it to have been, or hasn’t promoted tolerance sufficiently. What
would you say could be done to make society more tolerant?

SM: As a liberal, I find a lot to be sad about in modern
British society. What I would home in on is the felt need for
separate schools, particularly for separate faith schools. Not
because faith is unimportant; on the contrary, I think faith is
very important. But the sadness I have is the sadness that
Jewish people, Catholic people, Muslim people, Church of
England people, wish to educate their children separately
from children of other faiths. And it seems to me that the
aspiration for a genuinely multicultural society should be the
aspiration that we can indeed live together in the same
classroom, in the same society, in the same communities,
whilst respecting and acknowledging the different beliefs that
we have.

NW: People often accuse philosophers of not making any difference in
the world. It seems to me that here’s an area where philosophers have a
huge potential to affect what actually happens in politics. Do you think
they’re being heard by politicians?

SM: Politicians ask philosophers to speak quite a lot; I’m not
sure that they listen as well as they should. It’s certainly true
that here are areas where philosophers can draw attention to
the limits of political possibility. So to go back to the case of
those politicians who say ‘multiculturalism hasn’t worked’, I’d
be interested to know what’s meant by ‘working’ here, what
counts as ‘success’, and what is it appropriate to aim for in a
multicultural society. Philosophers have a huge amount to
contribute to the question of what we can legitimately hope
for. Because if the hope is the hope that sooner or later all
immigrants from different societies and different cultures will
get to be like me, white and secular and liberal, it’s not
realistic. And I’m not sure it’s even desirable to be in a society
of that kind. So politicians need to think about what they
mean when they say ‘multiculturalism hasn’t worked’.
