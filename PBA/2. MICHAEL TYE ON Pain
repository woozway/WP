Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Again

JOY AND PAIN

MICHAEL TYE ON
Pain

David Edmonds: There are several intriguing philosophical puzzles
about pain. Where, for example, do we experience it? If I cut my finger, is
the pain in my finger, or in my brain? What does pain reveal about
consciousness? It was a pleasure to discuss these questions with Michael
Tye of the University of Texas.

Nigel Warburton: We’re going to focus on pain. Obviously that’s an
important topic in most people’s lives from an experiential point of view,
but what’s the philosophical view here?

Michael Tye: I doubt that there’s one philosophical problem
of pain, but I’m interested in pain as a conscious state, and in
understanding how to locate the characteristic conscious feel of
pains within a world which I think as a whole is purely material.

NW: So, somebody steps on my toe, I feel the pain. I’m a conscious
pain-suffering individual. I don’t understand what the philosophical
problem is there?

MT: Well, if someone steps on your toe, then you feel pain
and you feel it in a particular location in your toe, and there’s a
characteristic phenomenal aspect, or subjective aspect to your
experience, one that distinguishes it from feeling an itch in
your toe, or a tickle, or whatever. One question is, ‘How do
we understand what it is for the pain to be in your toe?’, and
the other is, ‘How do we understand the awful painful aspect
of pains?’ The first of these may seem to be easy to answer,
but on reflection it’s not because you can feel a pain in a toe
even if you lack a toe: there’s the well-known phenomenon of
phantom-limb pain. You can’t have a coin in a pocket unless
you have a pocket, so how can you have a pain in a toe if you
don’t have a toe? The answer to that is that pains are, in this
respect, like perceptual experiences: you can have a visual
experience of a dagger even if there is no dagger, as Macbeth
did, and that’s because Macbeth’s visual experience repre-
sented to him that a dagger was before him when in reality
there wasn’t, so it was a case of misrepresentation. Analo-
gously, we should think of pains as experiences that, in part,
represent bodily parts, for example toes, and in some cases can
misrepresent, so that you can have ‘a pain in your toe’, even if
there is no toe there.

NW: There’s a difference between the hallucination in the case of Macbeth,
where the dagger doesn’t actually exist in front of him, and the case where I’m
mislocating the causes of my pain. I’ve still got a genuine pain because of that
intrinsically subjective-felt experience of pain. That’s what pain is.

MT: I agree that there is that disanalogy. There are two things
that need to be distinguished here: there’s the disturbance in
the body, which in normal cases will exist—there’ll be some
damage to a bodily tissue, but it needn’t exist in every case. In
the case of phantom-limb pain, there may be no disturbance in
the limb, because, after all, the limb doesn’t occur there at all,
and there may be no disturbance in any other part of the body.
You can imagine a neurosurgeon directly stimulating the brain
and producing the experience of pain in the limb. But you’re
right, the pain itself in all of these cases definitely exists, and in
that way the pain itself is not like Macbeth’s dagger, say, which,
after all, doesn’t exist. So, what are we to say about the pain
itself ? I think that if you have a pain, then you have to feel a
pain, and if you feel a pain, then you have to have a pain. It’s
not like the case of heat, say. You can have heat around you
without feeling heat, or you can feel heat without having any
heat around. Heat and the feeling of heat are distinct; but pain
and the feeling of pain are not distinct. Why is this? The answer
is because pain is a feeling: pain is nothing more than a feeling.
As such, as a feeling, it’s a certain kind of experience, and a
pain in a leg is, if you like, a leg-pain feeling or experience.
A pain in an arm is an arm-pain experience, and those two
experiences obviously have something in common: they’re
both painful. They also differ. The disturbance that you take to
be present is in one bodily limb, and in the other case, your
experience locates it in the other bodily limb.

NW: You’ve said the pain is a feeling, but obviously not all feelings are
painful, so what is it that allows us to characterize a particular feeling as
a painful one?

MT: Part of what pains do, as experiences, is to represent or
inform us of certain kinds of disturbances that occur in our
bodies. The difference in that respect between a pain and an
itch, or a tickle, is that the relevant experience is tracking or
informing us of a different kind of disturbance in each case.
With a tickle, for example, it’s a certain kind of surface
disturbance to which the experience is responding; with a
pain, it may be an internal disturbance of a certain sort, and
there’ll be various physiological differences between the
relevant disturbances. Nonetheless, this still doesn’t really
come to grips with the painful aspect of pains. The painful
aspect has, in part, to do with the kind of disturbance that is
tracked; but it also has, in part, to do with the fact that pains
feel bad, and in that way they contrast, for example, with
orgasms. Sex is so popular because orgasms feel good. So
why do pains feel bad? The answer is because pains not only
inform us, or represent to us that there are certain kinds of
disturbances in our bodies, but they’re trying to tell us that
these disturbances are bad for us, and in that respect, they’re
the exact opposite of orgasms, because orgasm experiences
are trying to tell us that the relevant disturbances are good
for us. So in my view, there’s a valuational aspect to pain
experience, one that groups it with things like orgasms,
tasting ripe strawberries, and so on.

NW: When people talk about the pain of loss, or of bereavement, that’s
a genuine feeling of pain, but is it a metaphorical use of the word ‘pain’, or
does it have a close connection with the bodily damage type of pain?

MT: That’s a case of emotional pain, and while there will be
connections, because there is some phenomenology of
‘badness’, as it were, that kind of pain is more easily grouped
with cases, say, of anger or fear, or whatever. It’s interesting that
the ancient Greeks grouped pains generally with the appetites
and emotions, and they didn’t think of pains as going along
with bodily sensations. By contrast, modern neuroscience has
focused almost exclusively on the sensory aspect of pains. That
now is changing somewhat: it’s now widely admitted that pain
experience is tied not only to activity in the somato-sensory
cortex, which is the usual locus of bodily sensation, but also to
activity in the anterior cingulate cortex, and that seems to be
what’s responsible for the unpleasant aspect of pain. Subjects
who have certain kinds of brain damage and who don’t get the
relevant activity in the anterior cingulate cortex nonetheless feel
pains, but they report that the pains don’t feel bad to them, that
they don’t mind the pains, that they’re not bothersome in the
same way. So it looks as if the usual experience of pain is
constituted by these two different aspects: one responding to
what’s going on in the body, and the other then telling us that
it’s bad for us. Pains in some ways are like warning lights in cars.
You’re driving along and the warning light flashing red tells you
the oil level is low, and it flashes red because it wants you to take
immediate action to cure the problem. Likewise, pain is the way
it is because you can think of it like a kind of warning light for
the organism: it’s telling us that there’s something wrong in the
body, something that we ought to fix as fast as we can.

NW: But isn’t there an analogy there with psychological pain: there’s
something bad in my life that’s causing me angst and agony, and I ought
to do something about that?

MT: To that extent there is this connection between
emotional pain, and what we might call pain as a bodily
sensation—that’s the unpleasant aspect in both cases. What’s
lacking in the emotional pain case is the bodily sensory
component: you’re not going to get the same activity, for
example, in the somato-sensory cortex.

NW: What’s pain’s relation to pleasure? There are people who claim to
take pleasure in pain; there are people who say that pleasure and pain
aren’t even on the same dimension. Is pain a thing unto itself, or is it on a
continuum with pleasure?

MT: I was talking recently to someone who is a masochist,
and what he told me was that in normal contexts, walking
down the street or whatever, if he steps on a pin or bumps into
something, then he responds to pain in the normal way; but
there are certain contexts in which when he experiences pain,
he doesn’t have that kind of response to it at all. I’m inclined to
think what’s going on there is that there’s a difference in
cognitive reaction to the pain, brought about by the relevant
context. The usual desire that pain go away, a desire that we
who are not masochists have pretty much in all cases, is
brought about simply because the pain feels bad. We want pain
to go away a lot because pain feels very bad to us. But in the
case of this particular man, when he’s in certain contexts he
doesn’t want the pain to go away. Now, I asked him, does it still
feel bad to you in those contexts? He said, ‘Yes, it sort of does.
But I don’t want it to go away in the way in which I want it to
go away when I bang myself walking down the street.’ There’s
the unpleasant aspect to pain itself, and then there are the
cognitive reactions to the pain, and the desire that it go away.

NW: You’ve described your theory of consciousness as representationalist.
How can the mind represent pain?

MT: The basic model I have is an instrument model. If you
think about simple instruments—compasses, speedometers,
or whatever—they’re built in such a way that certain states of
the instrument are causally coordinated with certain external
states, and simply via that causal co-ordination, or causal
co-variation, or tracking rotation, states of the instrument
manage to represent external states. In the case of a speedom-
eter, when the pointer points to 60, it represents that the car is
going at 60 miles an hour, not because the driver is inter-
preting the speedometer, but because the speedometer is built
in such a way that the pointer’s position, when it’s at 60, is
causally co-ordinated with the car going at 60 miles under
design conditions. You can get misrepresentation if the
speedometer is not functioning as it was meant to, or in poor
conditions, and, analogously, Mother Nature has built part of
our brain so that it gets active under certain conditions when
there’s a certain kind of bodily disturbance that’s bad for us,
and thereby it manages to represent that disturbance.

NW: Can you be mistaken about your own pain?

MT: I think that you can be mistaken about your pain, at
least in the sense that you can think that you’re in pain, or
that you’re feeling pain, when in reality you aren’t. So, take
the case of the man who’s being tortured: a red hot poker has
been put on his back ten times in a row, say. He’s felt intense
pain ten times, on the eleventh time, he sees his torturer go
around the back with the red hot poker, something touches
his back, he cries out, for a moment he thinks he’s feeling
intense pain, and then a little bit later he thinks to himself,
‘Wait a minute, that didn’t feel quite the same way as the
ones before’, and the torturer comes out the front and shows
him an ice cube. I think what’s going on there is that, for a
moment, the man believes that he is in intense pain, when in
reality he isn’t. So, in that way, I think you can be mistaken
about your pain. Nonetheless, I do think that if you’re
genuinely feeling pain, then you are in pain. It’s just that
sometimes you can think that you’re feeling pain without
feeling pain.
