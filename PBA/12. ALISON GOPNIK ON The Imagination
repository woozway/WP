Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Again

MIND, SELF, AND
IMAGINATION

ALISON GOPNIK ON 
The Imagination

David Edmonds: Kids like to live in a fantasy world. That much is
obvious to any parent. But what’s that got to do with philosophy? Alison
Gopnik is a renowned psychologist who’s intrigued about the role that
imagination plays in our lives. She says this is linked to a concept much
puzzled over by philosophers—causation.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we’re focusing on is the imagination.
Why do we have an imagination at all?

Alison Gopnik: That’s a good question. Plato thought that
the poets should be exiled from the republic because they
were not only liars, but they were really bad liars who weren’t
very convincing. You could think of an evolutionary version
of Plato’s objections: it’s easy to see why understanding about
the real world would give us all sorts of evolutionary benefits.
But why would an understanding about things that aren’t true
and that you know aren’t true have evolutionary benefits? This
is a particular puzzle for developmental psychologists, because
two- and three-year-old children spend much of their time in
these wild, crazy, pretend worlds.

NW: For Plato, depictions of reality were at several removes from the
real world. We don’t have to accept platonic metaphysics to think there’s
still a problem about how playful, imaginary situations could possibly
teach us about reality.

AG: Yes—the problem becomes more acute if you think
about it psychologically and from an evolutionary perspective.
We are starting to approach an answer, but the answer actually
comes from thinking about a very different philosophical
problem and that’s the problem of causation. How is it that
we can tell the difference between a causal relationship and
a mere correlation relationship? And that deep philosophical
problem may hold the answer to the problem about why we
pretend.

NW: So what is the difference between cause and correlation?

AG: Good question. Well, there’s been a lot of argument
about this over the years. An idea from the twentieth-cen-
tury American philosopher David Lewis is that, when we
know that one thing causes another, we cannot just make
predictions about what will happen if one event takes place,
but we can make counterfactual inferences. We can say not
just that if you smoke a lot then lung cancer will follow, but
that if you hadn’t smoked then you wouldn’t have got lung
cancer. Here’s an example that nicely illustrates this: having
yellow, nicotine-stained fingers is correlated with lung
cancer just as smoking is correlated with lung cancer. But
we don’t think that yellow fingers actually cause lung
cancer.

How can we cash out that intuition? Well, we don’t think
that, for instance, washing your hands will affect whether you
get lung cancer. But we do think that stopping smoking will
affect it. Now, recently, a philosopher, James Woodward, has
come up with what is called the ‘interventionist theory of
causation’. You might ask, why would we want to know
about counterfactuals, why would we want to know about
what would have happened? After all, counterfactuals just lead
to guilt and regret! And Woodward has argued that if you
think in terms of the future rather than the past,
counterfactuals are really very helpful. So if I know that
smoking causes lung cancer, and if I want to know what to do
in the future to decrease the amount of lung cancer, I’ll know
that I should intervene on smoking. So Woodward says that
what it means for x to cause y is that if you—to use a
technical term!—‘wiggle’ x, if you change x, than some
change will take place in y.

NW: Though obviously smoking isn’t the only cause of lung cancer. So
wiggling x—reducing smoking—won’t absolutely eliminate lung cancer.

AG: That brings up another really important aspect of these
new philosophical approaches to causation—probability. The
picture that comes out of a probabilistic view of causation is
this: you are not changing absolutely whether something will
happen or not. What you’re always doing is messing about
with probability. In the past decade or so, in philosophy,
psychology, and cognitive science there’s been a real revolu-
tion in our understanding of human cognition; the new idea is
that we are almost always thinking about probabilities, rather
than about actual facts. Often, we’re not just asking, for
instance, is this true or false, but how likely is this hypothesis
compared to another hypothesis? And this is the key to the
problem we started out with about imagination.

NW: So it’s as if children with their imaginary games are proto-scien-
tists; they are exploring hypotheses which then could possibly be verified or
refuted by experience?

AG: Well, for twenty years developmental psychologists
have used the idea that what children are doing is very much
like science—they’re trying to figure out the casual structure
of the world. One thing we’ve discovered experimentally, for
instance, is that two- and three- and four-year-olds are working
out theories about how other people’s minds work. Three-
year-olds, for instance, don’t seem to understand that you and
I might have really different beliefs about the world, and that
that would lead to changes in our actions. But four-year-olds
do understand this. And it looks as if what happens is that the
two- and three-year-olds go out and do experiments and
explore the world and figure out how the world works and
develop new causal theories, just like scientists. Children are
very concerned about causation; children are figuring out the
casual structure of the world all the time. We can do experi-
ments where we show children new patterns of evidence and,
sure enough, right away they make causal inferences. So
children are pretending a lot and also working out the causal
structure of the world a lot. Maybe there’s a connection
between those two facts?

NW: Children explore imaginary situations; some elements of those
situations will mirror the real world, but others won’t. As a child, how
can you determine which bits are ones giving you real-world information?

AG: Well, one of the things that we found out empirically—
the developmental psychologist Paul Harris has done this
work—is that although children’s imagination might look wild
and crazy, internally it is quite logical. And that’s also true of
adult fiction and adult imagination. Children might say, here’s
a premise that is going to seem unlikely or unusual—‘a boy
turns out to be in wizard school’. Or a two-year-old might
imagine that a stuffed teddy bear is a real person and a real
friend. So you start with this extremely unlikely, low-probabil-
ity hypothesis. But then the inferences that you make from
that premise reflect perfectly good causal logic. So you say,
well, if Harry Potter were a wizard and going to wizard
school, he would have to acquire clothes and books and do all
the things that children do. And Paul Harris showed some-
thing similar even with two-year-olds. If you say to two-year-
olds, ‘Here’s teddy and we are going to pretend that teddy is
having tea and he spills the tea over himself ’, and you ask the
children, ‘Will teddy be wet or dry?’, they say he’ll be wet.
And little children can be quite fierce and specific about this:
even if you’re starting out from a crazy premise, that doesn’t
mean that you are allowed to have any old consequence, you
have to work through those premises in a logical way.

NW: So that’s children. I can understand why they need to discover
how the world works. But as adults, do we still need imagination in the
same way?

AG: We don’t need imagination in quite the same way—and
we don’t indulge in imagination as much as children. But
when we’re in the same position that children are in, trying to
figure out new things about the world or create new ways
of thinking about the world, then that’s exactly when imagin-
ation kicks in. You could think about drama or fiction as
serving the function of telling us about what the conse-
quences would be of what look like very unlikely probabil-
ities. But what’s interesting about human beings from an
evolutionary point of view is that we’re always exploring very,
very low-probability hypotheses. And, in fact, we take things
that start out being very unlikely and we actually make them
real. So, if you look around this room that we are in right now
and think about it from the perspective of a hunter-gatherer
in the Pleistocene, everything is imaginary. Not just the
computers and the light bulbs, but also the woven fabrics and
the right-angle construction of the tables. From the perspec-
tive of the Pleistocene, all those things started out as a very,
very weird, strange idea in some guy’s head: ‘Gee, what would
happen if we did this?’ The ‘Gee what would happen if we did
this?’ is the central question that causal cognition and causal
thinking allows you to address.

NW: The process of imagining something and bringing it into reality
assumes that the hypothesis or imaginary situation can be brought into
reality. But lots of imaginary situations will be wasted, as it were. They
will be explorations which fall by the wayside because they are just
unrealizable in reality.

AG: Well, the difference between children and adults is that
the children don’t actually have to do anything. A great
evolutionary mystery is why humans have this extremely
extended period of childhood when, to be blunt, children are
completely useless. They don’t bring home the bacon, they
don’t do anything useful; in fact, they’re worse than useless
because we have to put in so much time and energy taking
care of them. And the answer seems to be that there’s an
evolutionary division of labour. We have this early period in
which we can simply explore alternatives, learn as much as we
can about the world around us, create and imagine new
possibilities, without being under the constraints of needing
to get on in the world, and doing the things we need to
survive. And then what happens is that as adults we can take
all of that exploration and learning that we did as children and
put the products of that to use to actually make things happen
in the world. So you could think of it like this: evolution has
designed children to be the research and development division
of the human species and we adults are production and
marketing.

NW: I can imagine an artist or a poet reading this and responding,
‘No that’s not what the imagination is about; you’re just interested in
pay-offs, but the imagination has value in itself.’

AG: Thinking about children is helpful in this regard,
because from the grand evolutionary perspective, childhood is
absolutely essential; but, of course, from their own perspec-
tive, children aren’t playing or exploring because they are going
to be solving this evolutionary project. The interesting
paradox is that what enables human beings to achieve our
evolutionary goals in the long run is being able to pull
ourselves away from achieving goals in the short run. So
having this protected period, having a period of play, having a
period when you aren’t actually trying to accomplish goals,
paradoxically turns out to be one of the best ways of accom-
plishing your goals in the long run.

NW: So, clearly, every executive board ought to have at least one child
playing in the background.

AG: Well it’s no coincidence that my friends from Silicon
Valley have beanbag chairs and balls to play in—and if you go
to a place like the Googleplex, there are lots of opportunities
to play. If your goal is innovation, that child-like sense of
exploration is the best strategy to produce innovation.

NW: What we’ve been talking about is a mixture of philosophy and
psychology; a purist will say, ‘Psychology is really interesting but it has
nothing to do with philosophy.’

AG: Well, it’s funny because if you think about the great
philosophers whom we all admire—like my personal favourite
David Hume, or Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, or Locke, they
didn’t think that what they were doing was this special thing
called philosophy separate from science. In fact, Hume very
explicitly thought that what he was doing was applying
scientific methods to the study of the mind. It’s only quite
recently that there’s been this idea of a sharp divide between
philosophy and psychology. And my own view is that you
should think about philosophy as really very theoretical
everything. So if you are doing very theoretical art, then you
are doing aesthetics, and if you are doing very theoretical law,
then you are doing ethics. If you are doing very theoretical
psychology, then you are doing what’s often called philosophy
of mind. And if you are doing very theoretical developmental
psychology, then you’re doing epistemology. We’re all trying
to answer the same deep, profound questions, things like how
is it that we come to understand the world around us.

The philosopher Quine had a nice image about the giant
web of belief; some parts—the scientific parts—are closer to
the edges where we make contact with the world and some
parts—the philosophical or mathematical or theoretical
parts—are closer to the centre of the web. But it is all one web,
and finding out something new about the world can change
even very abstract ideas we have. And vice versa: thinking very
abstractly about things like counterfactuals can tell us
something very concrete, such as why three-year-olds have
imaginary friends. It’s actually very exciting, especially in
developmental psychology, to see how work that, to be frank,
most philosophers would have turned their noses up at—
questions like, ‘Why do two-year-olds think that teddy bears
will get wet if we poured tea on them?’—turns out to be
extremely revealing about deep philosophical issues.
