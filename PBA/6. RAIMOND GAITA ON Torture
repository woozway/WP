Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Again

MORALITY

RAIMOND GAITA ON
Torture

David Edmonds: There’s a ticking bomb, and the only way the police
can find out how to defuse it is to torture the terrorist who’s planted
it—thousands of lives are at stake. In such a scenario, is torture legit-
imate? Many philosophers enjoy debating such questions. But not Rai
Gaita. Society, he says, is defined, in part, by what it refuses to debate.
And he regrets that the question of whether torture is ever legitimate has
even been raised.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we’re focusing on is torture, specifically,
the justification of state torture. Can you tell me how you got into
thinking philosophically about torture?

Rai Gaita: I began thinking about this when Alan Dershowitz,
an academic lawyer at Harvard, published Why Terrorism
Works: Understanding the Threat, Responding to the Challenge. He
argued that citizens in democratic nations like the US, Britain,
and so on, should consent to the torture of suspected terrorists,
done openly, under law, when there is good reason to
believe it would save many—perhaps thousands—of lives. I
was shocked and incredulous. I had assumed that in western
democracies there was no longer a case for torture that could
be taken seriously, no more than there is, in those democracies,
a ‘case’ for stoning women who have committed adultery.

Dershowitz on the other hand—and many people agreed
with him—was incredulous that his opponents could be so
irresponsibly intoxicated by an ideal of absolute value that
they would refuse to take his case seriously. Generations of
philosophers, after all, had discussed scenarios like that of ‘the
ticking bomb’. Now, however, no one could say these were
merely fantastical examples.

I became interested in how best to characterize this dispute:
to explore the complex relations between morality, law, and
politics, to ask what place, if any, the idea that some things are
undiscussable should play in a sober conception of public
reason.

I also wondered what had changed since the Convention
against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman, and Degrading
Treatment or Punishment came into force in 1987. ‘Terrorism,
stupid’, someone might say. I don’t think it is so simple.

Confronted in the twentieth century with politically motiv-
ated mass murder by the right and the left and by genocide in
the heart of Europe, in Asia, in Africa, and in Central America
(Guatemala), no one who was even moderately politically
informed could have failed to realize how important it is for
states to safeguard the lives of their citizens. Yet that, often
bitter, realization prompted no one then seriously to propose
publicly that torture should be one of the means with which
to do it. To the contrary, that same blood-soaked century saw
the development of international law, which included the
prohibition of torture without exception. Could anyone
seriously believe that those who drafted the Convention did
not anticipate that compliance with it would almost certainly
cause lives to be lost that would otherwise have been saved? To
believe that would be to believe that they were moral and
political dilettantes. And though governments have a defining
obligation to protect the lives of their citizens, they also
require their citizens to risk their lives in combat. For the most
part, their citizens consent, not in order to create, or preserve
political circumstances in which fewer lives would be lost in
the future, but for the sake of Freedom and Dignity (capitals
intended), values that often define their political identity. Like
many others, I have pointed out that terrorists threaten only
our lives: to save our lives, governments have threatened some
of our deepest values. Some citizens consented to this. Others
protested that in ‘the war against terror’ they are prepared to
die for those values. They do not think of this as a constraint
on the protection of the national interest: they think it is
intrinsic to a richer conception of the national interest that
citizens should be able to love their country without shame.
They invited their fellow citizens to join them in a different
kind of ‘coalition of the willing’.

I have come to suspect, however, that there is an important
difference—one that defines the nature of politics—between,
on the one hand, being prepared to face death to protect
political values like liberty, equality, the freedom to speak
one’s native tongue and to honour one’s history without
falsification, and on the other refusing to do evil ‘though good
may come of it’. Perhaps that explains the bitter political tone
of Gorgias, Plato’s dialogue in which Socrates professes, and,
I think, introduced into western moral and political thought,
the affirmation that it is better to suffer evil than to do it. His
incredulous interlocutors scorned him for being so shameless
as to refuse to do what was necessary to protect himself and,
more importantly, those who were dependent on him if only
evil means were available to him to do so. With M. M. McCabe
I conducted a seminar on Gorgias at King’s College London
just after September 11. The atmosphere in that seminar was
electric. Everyone knew what was at stake.

NW: So, you seem to be suggesting that state torture is one of those
things that is undiscussable in a civilized society? But, surely, you need an
argument for that, not just an assertion.

RG: Certainly, there should be discussion of whether some
things are unthinkable. It is striking that there hasn’t been
such a discussion, even though, on the face of it, you can tell
what kind of person someone is partly by what she finds
morally unthinkable, and the character of a nation by noting
what is undiscussable in it. However, it goes deep in our
political culture and our intellectual tradition to believe that
we should be open to being persuaded of any position for
which a strong argument appears to have been mounted. But
is it always a good thing to be open to persuasion? After all, it
is not good to be open to persuasion that the earth is flat, or
that one can read one’s future in coffee grounds, or that Elvis
is still alive and working for the CIA. To have an open mind on
these matters shows that one is gullible, which is no virtue; it
betrays a failure of judgement that undermines the capacity
for radical critique that we hope will be achieved by always
having an open mind. Some forms of open-mindedness are
aptly caricatured in the joke that tells of a person whose mind
was so open that his brain fell through.

Morally, too, there are things about which one should not
have an open mind because one should fear to be the kind of
person who believes them and takes them into her life. It is not
a moral or intellectual virtue to have an open mind about
ethnic cleansing, genocide, castrating male paedophiles, or
stoning women to death for adultery—to believe that a case
might be made for such evils and that one should be open to
being persuaded by it. But none of these have been shown
to be false by something we could justifiably call moral
knowledge. Nothing interesting in morality could be written
up in text books or encyclopaedias of morality. If there
could be textbooks of moral knowledge, then we could have
Nobel laureates of morality and moral whiz kids.

If I’m right, it is not dogmatic to refuse to be open to
persuasion about those matters. I’d go further, indeed, to argue
that it is a criterion of moral seriousness not to be open to
persuasion about some matters. It is a conceptual truth, a truth
we can discern merely by reflecting on the concept of moral
value, that a person must take seriously the moral values that
she professes. To refuse to be open to some moral views is
intrinsic to the kind of seriousness that defines morality and
distinguishes it from other kinds of value.

NW: Another way of formulating what you’re saying is that those
who want to justify torture see it as a means to an end. They’re prepared
to engage in a consequentialist analysis—to assess whether torture can be
justified by its consequences. Whereas those who want to have an absolute
prohibition on torture believe that it should not be tolerated, whether or
not there are good consequences that might ensue from it—whether or not
it saves thousands of lives.

RG: Dershowitz is not a consequentialist, and I suspect that
many people who think that their government should torture
people when there is good reason to believe it would save
many lives also think (if only implicitly) that consequentialism
does not give a good account of political responsibility—the
kind that Max Weber had in mind when he distinguished an
‘ethics of absolute ends’ from an ‘ethics of responsibility’.
Many of them, I am sure, believe that we must sometimes do
evil to prevent a greater evil, even though the evil we are
obliged to commit—the ‘lesser’ evil—is morally terrible. No
consequentialist can believe that we can be obliged to do what
is morally terrible.

NW: In assessing the consequences of torture, there’s one knock-down
argument that people try to use against it—which is to say, ‘torture just
doesn’t work’. And that’s the reason why it’s prudentially wrong to
use it. Faced with the threat of pain or actual pain, most people, at some
point, will say anything, true or false. So information from torture is
unreliable.

RG: That claim is more controversial than people who make
it generally allow. The moral restrictions placed on torture
by those who have defended it are high, so high, indeed, that
people have justifiably ridiculed ticking bomb scenarios as
belonging only to a political fairyland. But it is worth noting in
this regard that Dershowitz was influenced by an Israeli
commission of inquiry that successfully recommended that the
use of ‘moderate physical pressure’ become lawful so that
Israeli law could realistically allow the security services to
protect the state, while at the same time controlling their excess.
Yitzhak Rabin, who was then prime minster, complained
that the security services could not operate effectively to
prevent terrorist attacks if they were restricted to the forms of
interrogation the commission allowed them. I assume he knew
what he was talking about. Whether you regard torture as a
useful means of getting information depends on what you are
able and prepared to do to reduce the chances that people who
are tortured will say anything to stop the torture. If you are
prepared to torture their loved ones (which some nations are)
and to accept a high level of ‘collateral damage’, then torture
would probably be sufficiently effective to warrant its use
alongside other methods.

NW: Another kind of anti-torture argument concerns the intrinsic
dignity or autonomy of individuals: this claim often has a Kantian
underpinning. The eighteenth-century German philosopher, Immanuel
Kant, said that you should not treat other people as means to an end.

RG: Most, perhaps all, people who justify torture place
moral constraints on when it is justified. They would therefore
say that they have satisfied the imperative that one should
never treat another human being only as a means to one’s
ends. It is also important to note that most Kantians did not
argue that torture is never justified because it offends against
the intrinsic or inalienable dignity of its victims. They argued
that the concept of inalienable dignity reveals what kind of
violation torture is; reveals why we should count torture as a
violation whose character cannot fully be accounted for by the
pain and psychological trauma it causes. Another way of
putting it would be to say that they thought that to show
torture to be a violation of the intrinsic dignity of its victim
would be to show why it is morally terrible, even when we are
obliged to do it.

The way we now speak about intrinsic dignity, inalienable
dignity, or Dignity with a capital ‘D’, distinguishing it from the
dignity that is so obviously lost when a person is tortured,
owes more to Kant that to the Catholic natural law tradition,
which also has a conception of the dignity of humanity. Such
phrases occur in many of the preambles to instruments of
international law and are presumably intended to indicate how
we should elaborate what it means morally to commit acts
proscribed by those instruments. They have great rhetorical
power for us, but most people who respond to that power
would have little idea of what to make of the claim that its
moral force rests on the respect owed to rational agency.
Imagine if a remorseful torturer were to say, ‘My God! What
have I done? I have violated the rational agency of this poor
wretch.’ Of course, that is a parody, and parodies can be unjust,
but this one should alert us to something: an explanation is
required as to why an account that is intended to make
perspicuous to reason the distinctive seriousness of doing
something morally terrible, looks like a parody.

NW: So, you’re saying that Kant is too cerebral—the argument that
torture doesn’t respect somebody’s rationality doesn’t encapsulate what’s
wrong with torture.

RG: Yes and no. Kant is a magnificent example of a philosopher
who believes that when we think about the great matters
of morality and politics, the cognitive content of one’s
thought, the content that is strictly answerable to reason and
truth, should always be, in principle, extractable from the
form of its presentation. Much of my work has articulated
reasons for believing that separation emaciates art (especially
literature) and philosophy. My argument has not been only
that the discursive thought characteristic of philosophy should
be more respectful of art. It has been the more radical
argument—that when we reflect on our critical responses to
art and to life, when, for example, we reflect on whether we
have been moved by something in art or in life only because
we have succumbed to pathos or to sentimentality—then such
reflection can yield a richer conception of discursive thought,
one in which feeling and thought, form and content cannot
be separated. Obviously, I can’t elaborate on that here, but
were I able to do so, I would explain why my parody of what
remorse looks like when one moves from talk of inalienable
dignity to its Kantian grounding in respect for rational
agency is not unjust. It matters to have an ear for tone—for
what, as Bernard Williams put it, ‘rings true’. I would go
further than Williams to say that the acknowledgment that
discussions must ‘ring true’ should, in ethics, be part of a
conception of what it is to try to see things as they are, rather
than as they appear from any number of bad perspectives, of
what it is be legitimately persuaded by considerations and,
therefore, of what it is for truth and truthfulness to matter in
this realm. That is why I hesitated to reply flatly, yes or no, to
your question.

NW: Torture involves a terrible combination of pain or threat of pain,
helplessness, and degradation. What more can a philosopher do than emit
a response of ‘Yuck, that’s a disgusting practice and one that we cannot
tolerate?’

RG: There is a lot philosophers can do to help us to see the
many things at issue in contemporary disagreements about
torture, the many perspectives on what is at issue, and how
best to discuss them. To counter strong cultural and political
forces that push us towards oversimplification, we need to
draw many and fine distinctions.

Allow me to give another example, which I hope illustrates
the complexity of the relations between morality, law, and
politics. It will take us back to your opening remark—that we
are thinking about torture committed by states in what they
believe to be their national interest. That was assumed in
most of the recent discussions, of course, but the focus on
those discussions was almost exclusively on the lives of
individuals. If that were all that was at issue, we could, as
I suggested earlier, point out to our politicians that we are
prepared to risk our lives, rather than to secure them at such
moral cost.

Sometimes, however, if a political community suffers many
and repeated terrorist attacks, as Israel did during the 1980s,
those attacks threaten more than the lives of its citizens:
they threaten the very conditions of civic life, of political
communality indeed. In an article in the Guardian, the Israeli
novelist David Grossman wrote that in such circumstances
terror is ‘a decomposition enzyme’. ‘A country that fights
terror’, he said, ‘fights not only for the physical security of
its citizens. It also fights for their reason to live, for their
humanity, for everything that makes them human and
civilized.’ In such circumstances, politicians will insist that it is
‘necessary’ to be prepared to do morally terrible things in
order to protect the conditions of political communality, and
they will ask their citizens to consent to such deeds, not as
individual human beings, but as citizens mindful of the
distinctive nature of political ethics. It might now be apparent
that I think of the ethical, more or less as Bernard Williams
suggested we do, as a realm in which we think about how we
should live—about morality, of course, but also about law
and politics, and other distinctive forms of value, in complex
ways interconnected but not merely variants of one another:
indeed, they may sometimes conflict.

In a fine paper in which he discusses the justification that
people like Dershowitz and other American jurists offered,
after September 11, for the legalization of torture in certain
circumstances, the legal philosopher Jeremy Waldron says he
was ashamed at the dishonour they had brought on American
jurisprudence because they had proposed something which is
entirely contrary to the spirit of ‘our form of law’, as he puts
it. The prohibition against torture he says, is emblematic of the
spirit of that law: ‘Law’, he writes, expressing not a statement
of fact, but what he believes is the essence of ‘our’ law, ‘is not
brutal in its operation; law is not savage; law does not rule
through abject fear and terror, or by breaking the will of those
whom it confronts. If law is forceful or coercive, it gets its way
by methods which respect rather than mutilate the dignity and
agency of those who are its subjects.’

If I understand him, Waldron believes that breaking the will
of a person by torture is always morally terrible, but he believes
in addition that the jurists he criticized had dishonoured not
only morality, but also the law as expressive of a value sui
generis. For him, the law against torture has an ineliminable
moral dimension, but it is not exhausted by that dimension, or
by that dimension together with other practical concerns that
could be characterized without reference to irreducibly legal
concepts.

I hope that enables us to see how someone who believes that
torture could be justified morally, might nonetheless oppose it
becoming lawful, not because of the prudential reasons for
which such a stand is often justified—the bad consequences
that might ensure were it to become lawful—but because she
believes, as Waldron does, that torture is an offence against
the essential nature and dignity of law. And a politician might
believe, without inconsistency, that torture can never be
morally justified and that it is an offence against the sprit of
law but that, nonetheless, in certain circumstances it must be
done, not only to protect lives, but, as I said earlier, to protect
the very conditions of political communality. Torn between
incommensurable imperatives, one political the other moral,
she might say that, if they are true to the responsibilities of
their vocation, politicians must sometimes do what morally
they must not do. To think that the conflicting imperatives
must be moral imperatives if they are truly answerable to
a serious conception of responsibility is, I think, to be in the grip
of a moralistic conception of responsibility. It would also be a
mistake to think that because the political imperative overrides
the moral one for the politician, her elaboration of why it does
so—an elaboration intended to reveal the distinctive responsi-
bility her vocation has placed on her—must be intended as a
justification for what she intends to do or has done. To insist
that it must be offered as justification is to fail to understand the
nature of tragedy. This is, I know, very controversial. I cannot
defend it in this interview. I have mapped a conceptual terrain,
hoping to reveal the difficulties in navigating it.

NW: Would it be fair to encapsulate your view on this matter as this:
we can salvage something from Kant. What we can salvage is some kind
of respect for humanity, and this respect should be embodied in our civic
institutions?

RG: The idea that every human being possesses an inalienable
dignity to which we owe an unconditional respect is, in
certain contexts, a sublime one—when, for example, it
requires us to respect unconditionally the human dignity of
even radical evil doers—people who have committed the most
foul deeds, who are entirely unrepentant of them, whose
characters appear as foul as their deeds and in whom we can
find nothing from which remorse might grow. But in some
contexts the affirmation that there is a form of dignity that
survives the most radical degradation, when alienable dignity
is entirely lost, tries to express something wonderful but fails
to do it.

An example might help to explain what I mean. It comes
from Primo Levi’s book, If This is a Man. Levi and a friend,
Charles, were prisoners in Auschwitz. They could hear the
Russian artillery and therefore had reason to believe that they
might soon be liberated. In the barrack with them was a
young man, Lakmaker, who had dysentery and who fell out of
his bunk to lie on the floor in his faeces and vomit. Levi writes:

Charles climbed down from his bed and dressed in silence.
While I held the lamp he cut all the dirty patches from the straw
mattress and the blankets with a knife, he lifted Ladmaker from
the ground with the tenderness of a mother, cleaned him as
best as possible with straw taken from the mattress and lifted
him into the remade bed in the only position in which the
unfortunate fellow could lie. He scraped the floor with a scrap
of tin plate, diluted a little chloramine and finally, spread
disinfectant over everything including himself.

Charles’ behaviour is something to wonder at, but it can elicit
two kinds of wonder. The first is directed towards him and his
virtues: it is inspired by the fact he risked his life after years in
Auschwitz, with freedom probably only weeks away, for the
sake of someone who would almost certainly die, perhaps that
same day. From the perspective of that kind of wonder, one
would rightly call Charles’ behaviour supererogatory—‘above
and beyond the call of duty’. The second kind of wonder is
quite different. It is inspired by the fact that Charles responded
‘with the tenderness of a mother’, which focuses our attention
more on Lakmaker than on him. Supererogatory acts show us
what people are capable of. They are, to exaggerate only a
little, moral feats that leave us awestruck. Heroic deeds are
their paradigm. Many people speak of saints and heroes in the
same breath, but the works of saintly love do not leave us
awestruck at the capacities of saints to do what they do.
Instead, they illuminate the world for us, and in the case of
deeds like Charles’, they reveal to us, or remind us, that even
people who are radically and incurably afflicted are infinitely
precious. But if that is true, then to say that when Charles
responded to Ladmaker ‘with the tenderness of a mother’, he
responded to his inalienable dignity, visible even in such
degrading affliction, is to speak in the wrong key—the heroic
and noble key in which talk of inalienable dignity and so much
else in Kant often moves us. For that reason, I suggest that we
do what comes naturally and call the understanding shown in
Charles’ tenderness a form of love. Levi gives us no reason to
believe that Charles was a religious man. Levi certainly was
not. I am not. I hope though that you will understand why I
call what Charles did a work of ‘saintly love’.

Torture is the radical denial of what moves us in Levi’s
story. A torturer assaults that to which Charles responded in
Ladmaker and which exists in every human being. It can
reduce a person to the point where someone who responded
to them as fully human, as though their humanity had not
been radically diminished, would inspire the same kind of
wonder in us as Charles does.

If I am right to say that the humanity of a radically degraded
victim of torture is fully visible only to saintly love of the kind
shown by Charles, then a torturer could not fully understand
the evil he does, even when he does it believing it to be his
duty. Yet, it is essential to the idea that torture is a lesser evil
that we may be obliged to commit, that we could fully
understand the evil we do to the person we torture. Only if
the person’s humanity remains fully visible to us is that
possible. The paradoxical conclusion then is that only a saint
could respond fully to the humanity of a degraded victim of
torture. But a saint, we know, could not be a torturer or agree
to torture.

NW: So what are the implications for your arguments on how our civic
organizations should be run?

RG: Institutions of government and other civic institutions
are often complicit in or actually encourage the dehumanization
of some of their citizens and also the citizens of other
nations when they denigrate them in jingoistic fervour. At first
sight, dehumanizing people seems itself a gross offence
against morality, but it is more basic than that. It creates the
conditions under which their humanity is no longer fully
visible to us because in those conditions we find it difficult to
see that anything they can do or suffer could go deep in their
lives, and therefore that they could be wronged as ‘we’ can be.
Racism is an obvious example.

In A Common Humanity: Thinking about Love and Truth and
Justice, I argued that a concern for justice is, in large part, a
concern that our institutions encourage us to see, and to be fully
responsive to, the full humanity of our fellow citizens, including
those who threaten to kill us without mercy. More often than
not, our institutions fail in this, but it is not a demand we make
only of saints. We make it—and it is essential to the institutions
of civil society that we make it—of our fellow citizens. In our
political and other public institutions—prisons, detention
centres, mental hospitals, and homes for the aged, for
­ example—no one should be so alienated from their ordinary,
alienable dignity, that only a saint could respond to them with
a compassion that was not spoilt by condescension or even an
undertone of contempt.

My argument would be to the conclusion that, if we are to
respond truthfully to affliction, it is imperative that we
disengage our moral and political vocabulary from the illusion
that even the most radically afflicted retain a dignity that their
degradation cannot take from them—dignity that should be
visible to us when our reason is not distorted by psychological
and moral failings of one kind or another.
