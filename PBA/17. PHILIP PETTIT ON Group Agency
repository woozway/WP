PHILIP PETTIT ON 
Group Agency

David Edmonds: Christian List of the London School of Economics
and Philip Pettit from Princeton University and the Australian National
University in one way constitute a group. They are the group of people
who’ve co-authored a book on Group Agency. The book argues that
groups, like corporations or political parties or churches or charities, can
be agents rather in the way individuals can be agents—they can have
goals, they can be held responsible. But groups are not merely an aggregate
of their individual components—as the group made up of me, Nigel, and
Philip Pettit, discussed.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we’re focusing on is group agency.
What’s that?

Philip Pettit: I think of group agents as a sub-species of
groups in general. Groups include the group of red-haired
people or the group of people who are the second born in the
family. The people in the group share a property, although
groups may differ in how far the property is one that ­ members
recognize, how important the property is to how they behave
and so on.

Group agents are a special sub-set of groups. They all have a
property in common, but the feature that makes them a group
agent is that they mimic an individual agent in how they behave.

NW: Could you give an example?

PP: Sure. Suppose the three of us constitute a group—perhaps
a group that meets every evening for a drink. But in order to
constitute a group agent, we would have to endorse some goal
or purpose that we want to advance together. And equally we
would have to form shared views about the best means to
advance this goal, about our sub-goals, about the order of
importance of our goals, and about how we could add to or
change our goals. We’ve got to do together what we all do
individually when we pursue a goal.

NW: So would a political party or a company count as a group
agent?

PP: Yes. Groups obviously vary enormously in size and in
structure, and any one of them might organize itself as a
group agent. Given that the three of us are a group, for
example, we could form a group agent in order to further
some political purpose. We’re speaking in Oxford, and we
might set ourselves the goal of advancing a green agenda in
the local areas. We would want to agree on sub-goals in that
case, on how those sub-goals rank in importance, on what
are the best means for pursuing them, and so on. We, as a
group, would have to do what I, as an individual, would have
to do if I decided on my own to pursue a green agenda.

NW: Are you saying that as a group we’re different from three
individuals?

PP: Yes, I am. There is quite a dominant tradition that says
it’s just a façon de parler to talk about a group as an agent. Only
individual human beings are agents, and what happens when
group agents seem to exist is just that those individuals
coordinate their actions to some purpose.

Now, at a certain level that’s true, but it misses something
very important. When you ask about the relationship between
the judgement or belief of a group on some matter and the
judgements of the individuals in the group, people who say
groups are just individuals will typically answer, ‘The views or
beliefs that the group holds are just the views or beliefs held
by a majority of the members.’

NW: That sounds reasonable. What’s wrong with that?

PP: When you begin to see what’s wrong with it you gain an
insight into why group agency is interesting.

Let me first make an abstract point. Suppose the three of us
have to agree on a set of judgements and decisions, because
we want to mimic an individual agent. We have to put
together our judgements and beliefs, desires and preferences
on various matters in order to form shared attitudes. Imagine,
then, that we’ve got to work out our judgements on whether P
is the case, and on whether Q is the case, and then on whether
P and Q—the conjunction of P and Q—is the case.

There are three of us here: me, David, and Nigel. Do we, as
a group, believe P? Well, I think P is the case, let us suppose,
and David thinks P is the case, so that’s the majority. But Nigel
doesn’t think P is the case. Still, that’s OK on the majoritarian
approach; as a group we believe P.

Then we vote on Q. It turns out that I think that it is also
the case that Q. David this time rejects it: he doesn’t think Q
is the case. But you, Nigel, accept that Q is the case. The
majority, tick off Q, the group believes Q. So the group believes
P and believes Q. But now the crucial question. Does the
group believe P and Q? Does it believe the conjunctive
proposition: P-and-Q?

Let’s try the majority vote. David doesn’t believe the
conjunction because he rejected Q. Nigel doesn’t believe it
because he rejected P. I’m the only one who accepts it, since
I alone accepted P and accepted Q. So if we follow majority
voting we’re stuck with saying that we believe P and we
believe Q, but we reject the conjunction, P and Q.

That’s a real problem. If we behaved like that, we couldn’t
operate as a group agent. We wouldn’t be able to get our act
together in various situations of choice and we wouldn’t be
able to present ourselves to others as a group agent with
whom they can do business.

NW: That’s really surprising. Does it have applications in real life? Are
there really P, Q, and P-and-Q decisions that we have to make?

PP: There are many examples. I became alerted to this
particular paradox through some legal literature on what was
called the doctrinal paradox, and I gave it the name of ‘the
discursive dilemma’, arguing that there was a wider problem
than arises in the legal case. Christian List and I then went on
to establish a more general result. But let us focus first on the
discursive dilemma.

Suppose the three of us constitute the board of a housing
association. A tenant comes to us with a complaint about a
landlord. The heater in his room blew up and caused him
great psychological harm.

Imagine that we have to decide on this complaint in the way
the courts would decide an issue like this. The landlord will be
blameworthy and liable if the tenant was actually harmed by
the blowing up of the heater and if the landlord had a duty of
care to look after the heater. And if both of those are the case,
then the landlord is liable, and maybe some punishment is due
to him.

Take the first issue: was the tenant traumatized by the
blowing up? David and I might agree he was. But Nigel thinks
not. But as a group we think, yes, he was indeed traumatized
by the incident.

Second issue: did the landlord have a duty of care for the
tenant, being required to look after the heater? David thinks
not. Nigel and I think he did. So, again, we agree that as a
group he had a duty of care.

But now comes the issue of whether we agree that the
landlord should be held culpable or blameworthy. Remember
that I am the only one who thought both that he had a duty of
care and that the poor tenant was traumatized. Each of you
rejected one of those. So you are each going to say ‘no’ on the
issue of whether the landlord is culpable; I’m the only one
who is going to say ‘yes’. But that means that as a group we
are going to be incoherent. We will have to say, ‘Yes, the tenant
was really hurt’, and ‘Yes, the landlord was really responsible.’
But ‘No, he can’t be blamed.’

The lesson of all of this is that, if we are to achieve the
coherence of a group agent in such a case, then the group
views we form cannot each answer by a majoritarian arith-
metic to our individual views.

NW: So what do we do?

PP: If the three of us are to behave as a group agent, we
have to mimic an individual. That means we have to be
capable of advancing shared purposes according to shared
representations. In order to achieve the status of such an
agent, we have to make sure that our representations and our
purposes are consistent. What this example shows is that we
can’t guarantee that the representations, or indeed the
purposes, will be consistent if we rely on majority voting
within the group. Happily, Christian List and I were able to
demonstrate that this is not just an accident of majority
voting. There is no simple way of starting with individuals and
their views, and then determining the group views by the
aggregation of those individual views, whether the aggrega-
tion be majoritarian in character or not.

NW: I’m a bit disconcerted by you using the word ‘happily’ there,
because the result you describe seems to be tragic.

PP: A very nice point, because it is tragic in a sense. It’s
what’s called in the literature an impossibility result. It’s
impossible to ensure that the views of a group are coherent or
consistent—it’s impossible to establish their collective
rationality, as we may say—and at the same time meet another
condition, which you might call individual responsiveness.
This is a condition requiring that a group agent should hold
only views that are responsive case by case to the views of
members. In order to act as proper agents, groups have to
make sure that they are collectively rational, or at least
sensitive to the demand for collective rationality, and that
means that on one or another issue they have to reject
individual responsiveness. They have to be ready to form
views that go against the dispositions of members as
individuals.

Thus, if we are going to get our act together in the housing
case, or the abstract P-and-Q case, then we can’t decide by
majority. On some issues, we as a group have to adopt one or
another view that does not correspond systematically to what
we as individuals hold on that issue. We as a group have to be
ready to reject the majority view on some proposition. We
might decide to accept the conjunction P-and-Q in the earlier
example, or to accept that the landlord is indeed culpable, even
though a majority of us reject that view. We have to be ready
to construct group attitudes, rather than letting those attitudes
be determined in a bottom-up way by the attitudes of
members.

NW: This is a fascinating paradox: were you the first to identify it and
recognize the ways in which groups can have group agency?

PP: There is actually a long tradition of recognizing that
individuals can combine into units or groups that themselves
are capable of acting like agents with common purposes and
beliefs. Interestingly, the Romans and the Greeks didn’t have a
notion of such a corporate entity, at least by many accounts.
But it emerged and became very influential in the Middle
Ages, being applied to bodies like the guild, the town, and the
monastic order—groups that attained a real salience in the
medieval world.

As these groups became salient, the lawyers and philo-
sophers began to talk of the corporate entity as an agent in its
own right, indeed as an agent that could speak for itself and
could count in that sense as an artificial person, a persona ficta.
Already in the 1300s, there was an influential group of thinkers,
mainly legal theorists, who argued that corporate entities are
agents in their own right. They’ve got standing in law like
natural persons. They own property, they enter contracts, they
can sue and be sued in the courts. It’s as if they each have a
mind of their own.

NW: Does this notion of a group mind end in the Middle Ages or does
it continue beyond that?

PP: It figures prominently in many seventeenth-century
thinkers, among them Thomas Hobbes. Hobbes thinks that
the state or commonwealth is a corporate agent, modelling
it, as he says, on a company of merchants. But he misleads
his successors by suggesting that what happens when you
get an incorporation of individuals—or at least one where
there is not a single dictator—is that the members form their
views by majority voting. This is the position endorsed later
by John Locke and by the Genevan-born philosopher
Jean-Jacques Rousseau. And, as we have seen, it is wholly
mistaken.

After Hobbes, there are two major developments, practical
and theoretical. The practical development occurs in the
nineteenth century, with the rise of the commercial corpor-
ation. Through most of the 1700s in Britain, it was only
possible to form a corporation by means of an Act of
Parliament. This measure had been adopted about the time
of the South Sea Bubble, when the South Sea Company,
founded in 1711 as a trading company, bubbled and burst.
Things began to loosen up only in the 1820s. Then over the
following 30 or 40 years in the UK and America you get an
amazing development; commercial corporations are granted
more and more independence. You can form a corporation
just by registering it with a notary. The corporation can
operate in any area within the domain of the legislation. It
can change its sphere of activity without having to go back to
parliament, or even go back to the registry. It can enjoy limited
liability. And it can own and control other corporations. As a
result of these shifts, you get a significant biomass of cor-
porate entities, a biomass that has grown from decade to
decade over the last 200 years.

NW: So that’s the practical way in which corporations have evolved—
what about the conceptual level?

PP: Well, very interesting things happen at the concep-
tual level. One is that in the late nineteenth century, a
German thinker, Otto Gierke, goes back to medieval
sources and develops a theory of corporate entities,
including churches, commercial corporations, political
parties, and states. These entities have got a life of their
own, he says—they’re real, if artificial, persons, as he puts
it. This view becomes very influential in the early twen-
tieth century, partly as a result of the inf luence of a
disciple of Gierke’s, the English legal historian, Frederic
Maitland. But the theory of corporate agency rapidly
wanes in inf luence later in the century, probably because
of an association in the popular mind with fascism. As we
know, fascism also talks the language of incorporation and
corporate entities.

In the fight against fascism you get a cult of what comes
to be called ‘individualism’. There are many senses in
which individualism is fine, but in the form that it assumed
in this movement it was taken to commit us to thinking
there are no such things as group agents. And frankly
we’re only recovering f rom the mid-century hegemony of
this denial of group agency, a denial prominent in the
work of people like Karl Popper and Friedrich Hayek.
They each insisted that there are no group agents, there
are just individual agents.

NW: Group agency usually hits the headlines when something goes
wrong; when, for instance, we blame a corporation for a disaster. Does
your approach have anything to say about that?

PP: Yes. There are two normative issues that are very
important. One is the question of whether group agents have
rights and the other is the question of whether group agents
have responsibility. The view that Christian and I defend is that
there is an asymmetry. Group agents should have very limited
rights, and indeed be subject to certain important checks as to
what they can do. On the other hand, group agents should be
capable of being held responsible.

Is this inconsistent? I don’t think so.

We look to the interests of individual human beings in
determining what rights these group entities should have, and
equally we look to the interests of individual human beings in
determining whether they are fit to be held responsible for
what they do. The reason why group agents should not be
given, say, equal rights with individual human beings is that
clearly this would give an incentive for individuals to coalesce
into these group agents, thereby individually profiting
themselves at perhaps great cost to the interests of other
individuals. But the interests of individuals also argue for
holding corporate agents responsible in their own right for
the ills they perpetrate. This is important because, as we
know, churches, commercial corporations, and the like can do
a lot more damage than individuals can. They have great
power and often vast resources, they suffer no anxiety, and
they have a long time horizon. Thus they should be exposed
to the possibility of being called to book for any abuses they
commit.

NW: Yes. I was thinking of particular cases. Recently, British
Petroleum has been blamed for the oil-leak disaster off the coast of
America. That’s blaming a corporation, not an individual. Should we
blame the corporation in that sort of situation?

PP: I believe that that’s exactly what you should do. Let me
go back to a particular example. In 1987, The Herald of Free
Enterprise, a ferry operating in the North Sea, sank, and
almost 200 people were drowned. A British government
report argued that the company was appalling; it had an
extraordinary culture of negligence that had existed for a long
time. Essentially, it was that culture, combined with the
unusual circumstances of very rough water, that led to a door
not having been raised in sufficient time, so that water washed
on board and sank the ferry. There was such uproar about
that, that a legal case was brought in the criminal courts in
Britain against the company.

And, very sadly, in my view, the courts decided that you
couldn’t hold the company criminally responsible or liable on
the grounds, roughly, that only individuals can have liability.
And when it came to an individual level of responsibility, well,
it turned out that no one individual could be held responsible
in any great measure because those who were actually there at
the door were just doing what they had been trained to do,
and the directors were following routines passed down from
their predecessors. Thus the corporation couldn’t be held
responsible in law and there was what I think of as a responsi-
bility deficit. This case shows why it’s very important in
general to be able to hold corporate groups responsible for
wrongs they do, as well as holding individuals within the
groups responsible for their part in perpetrating such a wrong.
The point has been acknowledged in UK law with the 2007
Corporate Manslaughter and Homicide Act, although it
remains to be seen how effective that Act proves to be.

NW: You’ve mentioned Christian List a few times in this interview.
Presumably, you are acknowledging a joint responsibility for the ideas
that you’ve been discussing today. Does that mean that the two of you
constitute a group, with group agency?

PP: Actually it does. You two, Nigel and David, have
co-authored books, so you must have had experience of this.
If you co-author with someone, you often find that as a group
you are committed to a view which, individually, you may feel
a little bit wary about or you may feel is too timid. You may
want to go further. And so, for example, our book has around
half a dozen footnotes where we say that on this issue the
group agent is prepared to commit thus and so, but the
individuals stand differently; but it’s important for us as a
group author that our views in the book are internally
coherent.

NW: Philip Pettit—and I guess Christian List—thank you
very much.
