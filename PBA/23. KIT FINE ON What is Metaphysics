Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Again

METAPHYSICS, MEANING,
AND REASON

KIT FINE ON
What is Metaphysics?

David Edmonds: Although Aristotle did not himself know the word,
the term ‘metaphysics’ was first used after his death by an editor to
describe a collection of his writings that we now think of as Aristotle’s
Metaphysics. ‘Meta’ means after or beyond, and there is speculation that
the editor meant to deter students from reading Aristotle’s Metaphysics,
until after they’d read his Physics. The term is notoriously hard to define,
so when modern philosophers describe themselves as working on meta-
physical questions, what exactly do they mean? A question for leading
metaphysician, Kit Fine, from New York University.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we’re going to focus on is what is
metaphysics? Now, a simple view of metaphysics is that it’s just about
reality: it’s the study of reality. Is that fair enough?

Kit Fine: Almost. It’s the philosophical study of reality. Of
course, many disciplines study reality. Metaphysics is the
philosophical study of reality, and of course, reality is a big
thing: you might think of it as including everything. So
metaphysics is the study of the most general features of
reality.

NW: How does that differ from science, because for many people,
science is the best way we have for discovering anything about the nature
of reality, whether it be the size of a planet, or the nature of a
microorganism?

KF: The main difference from science is that the philosoph-
ical study of reality is a priori. That means that it is inde-
pendent of observation. So, whereas the scientist will work in
the laboratory or rely on the results that issue from the
laboratory, the philosopher will not be so heavily dependent
on such results: he’ll just sit in his armchair, or her armchair,
and think about the nature of reality. The kinds of questions
they’ll consider will be the nature of space and time, the
nature of causation, what a person is, and so on and so forth.
These are just very general questions about what you might
call the fabric of reality.

NW: But if you’re just speculating from your armchair, how could you
possibly know that you are right, for instance, about the nature of time, or
space and time? It seems to me that you’ll want to get out of the armchair
and find out about things in the world if you’re investigating reality.

KF: This is a fundamental question facing the study of
metaphysics: ‘To what extent is it possible to gain a priori
knowledge of the general nature of reality?’ However, there
do seem to be questions of great interest that can only be
answered by a priori means. Let’s take the question of the
nature of cause. David Hume thought that causation was just
a matter of regularities: what it is for one thing to cause
another is for the one thing, or things of that type, to be
followed by things of the other type. Other people have
thought, well, there must be more, there must be some kind
of necessary connection. The one thing, in a real sense, must
make the other thing happen. There are no experimental
methods that could settle that question—at least on the face
of it, there don’t appear to be—so if we are to have any hope
of settling the question, it seems that we can only do it by
thinking about it in the armchair.

NW: Let’s take Hume’s example: one billiard ball rolls against another
one, there’s a click, the second ball moves. The first ball causes the second
one to move. Many people would think that if you want to understand
cause and effect what you have to do is investigate the nature of that
collision scientifically. Why is it a philosophical problem in the a priori
way you described?

KF: The actual detailed mechanism of the cause and effect
of how one billiard ball hitting the other would impact on the
other is a scientific matter, of course, but the question now is
this: if you do want to say, and maybe you don’t, but if you do
want to say that the first billiard ball hitting the second causes
the second to move, then the question is, well, what is the
nature of that causal relationship between the one event and
the other? We’re not interested in the actual details here of
how fast the one would move, given that it was hit by the
other, or what have you.

There’s a big divide here. Some people think that all we
have in the universe is just one thing following another, so if
there is causation here, it just must be a matter of this
particular event following the other particular event, and
similar events following from similar events. Other people
have thought causation cannot just be a matter of one thing
following another, there must be some kind of necessary
connection in the world. Somehow, it must be necessary if the
one event happened that the other happened if there’s to be
genuine causation. This is a very general question about the
nature of causation; it’s not one that, it seems, science can
answer.

NW: Given that this isn’t an empirical question, once you’ve got these
two candidate explanations or descriptions of cause and effect and how
they’re related, how do you discriminate between them?

KF: So, if you’re a Humean, or what now is called a
regularity theorist, you have to try to distinguish between
so-called accidental generalizations—generalizations where
one thing just happens to follow another—and genuine causal
generalizations. So it may well be, for example, that at five to
twelve, some people leave a classroom at one school, and
at twelve, some other children leave a classroom, but there’s
no causal connection between the two, so this is a purely
accidental generalization: the one happens to follow the other.
If someone is a Humean, they have to try to account as best
they can for that distinction between accidental generaliza-
tions and the causal generalizations. On the other hand, the
non-Humeans have to give an account of what this necessary
connection might be, of how it can do the kind of work that
we want it to do, and so on and so forth. We can frame the
question in terms of how adequate these answers are.

NW: So, in your example, with the school children leaving at five to
twelve and the other group leaving at twelve, this always seems to happen:
whenever one group leaves, five minutes later the other one does. Now
there’s probably no causal connection between those, yet it looks like there
could be because there is this pattern of regularity. Now, what you’re
saying there presumably is that that’s merely an accidental coincidence.
The thing we’re trying to investigate when we’re looking at cause and
effect is something which isn’t accidental, which seems to be a necessary
connection.

KF: Right. So certain generalizations are just accidentally
true: one thing just happens to follow another, but not for
a causal reason. There are others that seem to happen for a
causal reason. If you have a regularity view, according to
which causation is a matter of one thing following another,
you have to distinguish between the accidental cases of one
thing following another, and the genuinely causal cases. The
question is whether there’s enough resources within the
regularity theory to make the kind of distinctions we think
actually exist.

NW: Let’s take another example of a metaphysical question. You
mentioned the nature of a person; how could that be a metaphysical
question? Superficially it seems like a psychological question.

KF: Yes. We’re asking what is a person, and, if you like, what
is a person by his or her very nature. Perhaps we can get a feel
for the question by considering some of the answers that
might be given. You might think a person is simply his or her
body, or you might think that a person has something like a
soul, so the person is a soul, or you might think a person is
some combination of a soul and a body, or you might have a
view according to which there’s no more to a person than his
or her experiences. These are all very different views about
the nature of a person, a person as such, if you like, not the
nature of a person’s psychology or personality or what
have you.

NW: So, again, this is operating at a very general level, and that
seems to be a characteristic of metaphysics—that it’s not the kind of
very specific investigation of a particular individual, but more like the
question: ‘What is an individual?’, ‘What is a person?’, ‘What is
causation?’, ‘What is free will?’ Those are all big metaphysical
questions.

KF: Yes. There’s a great deal of generality in the question, so
we’re not interested in the nature of men as opposed to
women, for example—that wouldn’t be general enough. We’re
also interested in the nature of these things in themselves, that
is at the most abstract level, abstracting from the very
particular features they might just happen to have.

NW: A further example of metaphysics is the question, ‘What is a
number?’ What are the candidates there?

KF: There are a number of candidates. Some people have
just thought of numbers as the same as the signs for numbers,
the so-called numerals; other people have thought that
numbers are something abstract in some sort of platonic
realm existing independently of us; other people have thought
that numbers are some kind of mental construction, perhaps
somewhat like a fictional object that’s made up by the
mathematician in the way that a fictional character is made up
by an author. So these are three views, but there are many,
many others as well.

NW: It seems that the mathematician is doing something quite close to
what a metaphysician might be doing. He or she thinks about abstract
entities, reasoning in a way that doesn’t necessarily relate back to actual
individuals. Often mathematicians are thinking about the nature of an
equation, or trying to find some kind of entity that doesn’t seem to have
any direct connection with the real world as we experience it.

KF: Well, yes, mathematics is like metaphysics in being an a
priori investigation into reality. One of the reasons one might
have for thinking metaphysics is possible, is that mathematics is
possible. I should emphasize that mathematics is an a priori study
of reality. I’m not sure it’s the a priori study of the nature of
reality: mathematicians are not interested as such in the nature
of numbers or what have you: they’re interested in number.
Mathematics doesn’t have the generality of metaphysics, so
mathematics is interested in a very specific subject matter.

NW: Now, there’s a great tradition of metaphysics from the pre-
Socratics onwards, but in the twentieth century, it came under radical
attack, particularly from the logical positivist movement.

KF: Yes, it did and it’s only recently, actually, that philo-
sophers recovered from those attacks. They were taken very
seriously, and for a very long time, many philosophers, as a
result of those attacks, just dismissed metaphysics as so much
idle talk.

NW: So, let’s just run the sort of argument that A. J. Ayer popularized
in Language, Truth and Logic, against metaphysics: he said for
anything to be a meaningful statement, it has either to be true by
definition, like ‘All cats are animals’, or else it’s got to be empirically
verifiable, in the sense that you could do some kind of scientific experi-
ment to show that the statement that you made was true or false.

Anything that didn’t pass that two-pronged test for meaningfulness, ended
up in the category of meaningless statements which he pejoratively
labelled ‘metaphysics’.

KF: Yes, that’s true, he did make that attack, and Hume
made a similar attack before him. Behind that attack is a very
serious question, which is the question you started out with,
namely, ‘How can philosophers hope from their armchair to
discover anything about the nature of the world?’

NW: Given this quite vigorous assault on metaphysics as traditionally
conceived, how did it recover? You said it recovered, and in recent years
it’s been flourishing. How could it possibly recover from that attack?

KF: There are two explanations. One is just the intellectual
argument that identifies what is wrong with Ayer’s attack, and
there were many criticisms of Ayer. I’m not sure that many
philosophers actually subscribed, a decade or two after the
positivists’ attacks, to the so-called verification criteria of
meaning, but still it wasn’t clear that there was a viable
enterprise in doing metaphysics. Part of the reason had
nothing to do with the positivist attacks, but with the fact that
the quality of metaphysical discussion seemed to be very
obscurantist. So even if the positivist objections weren’t
correct in principle, they did seem to point to something that
was wrong in the discipline itself. Metaphysics often involves
very difficult concepts, and one might wonder whether these
concepts have any real application. So metaphysicians, for
example, claim to be talking about the fundamental nature of
reality, but what is this notion of fundamentality, or reality?
Another difficulty is that metaphysicians often seem to be just
disputing what’s a matter of common sense. They might say,
look, everything is mental, or everything is physical, and this
just seems to fly in the face of common sense. There are a
number of things that made metaphysics seem suspicious, and
what’s happened is that slowly philosophers realized that the
questions of metaphysics were real questions and were worth
studying.

NW: I can imagine a sceptical listener here who’s saying to himself,
or herself, ‘This is all very interesting for you, and your colleagues, but
why should any university be funded to have such people?’ Why do
metaphysicians exist at all, given scarce resources?

KF: For one thing, these questions are interesting in
themselves. There can be hardly a person who has not
thought about the nature of mind, or the nature of physical
reality, and how the two might relate. But also these very
general concepts are employed, or are pre-supposed, in many
other disciplines, and so by being clearer about these concepts
through metaphysics, we can be clear about their role in these
other disciplines. For example, the notion of cause is pervasive
throughout many different subjects. We talk about cause in
many different ways—in the social sciences, the physical
sciences, and what have you—and so one might hope that the
general study of these concepts could actually be of real
benefit to these other disciplines.

NW: I wondered if there’s one, single discovery or theory in the whole
history of metaphysics that you think encapsulates what can be achieved
with metaphysics?

KF: A good example is the distinction between primary and
secondary qualities which had a huge impact on science. The
thought was that the primary qualities were somehow really
in the objects themselves, so the primary qualities would be
things like length, or mass, and the secondary qualities would
be things like colour or taste. It was thought that the sec-
ondary qualities were a reflection of the human mind, how
we reacted to the primary qualities. That distinction suggests
that science should be about the primary qualities rather than
the secondary qualities. In so far as scientists are interested in
the physical world itself, rather than our reaction to it, then
that’s what this distinction would suggest. And making that
distinction had a huge impact on the study of science.
