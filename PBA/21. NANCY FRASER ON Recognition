Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Again

NANCY FRASER ON 
Recognition

David Edmonds: In Britain, Christmas Day is a national holiday,
but Passover and Eid are not. In this way, Christianity receives more
recognition, and might be seen as having a higher status in British
society, than Judaism or Islam. The way a society is run, or the way its
institutions operate, can appear to privilege one group or people, or one
way of life, over another. Nancy Fraser is an eminent political theorist
whose work has emphasized the significance of ‘recognition’.

Nigel Warburton: Nancy Fraser, we’re going to talk about recognition
and its link to multiculturalism. What does ‘recognition’ mean to you?

Nancy Fraser: Recognition is a concept that is having an
important revival in political philosophy. It’s a way of talking
about forms of injustice, such as disrespect, that drop out of
the standard models of distributive justice, which focus on
who gets what.

The question of whether the institutions of society express
equal respect for everyone can’t be analysed in terms of the
distribution of resources, and it’s in order to analyse that
question that we use the term ‘recognition’.

NW: So is ‘recognition’ just another way of saying ‘respect’?

NF: Recognition has to do with respect, esteem, prestige:
the way society values different traits, different activities. It has
to do, above all, with what I call patterns of cultural value.
For example, do our institutions express in their design, in
their structure, the idea that heterosexuality is a valued family
form and that homosexuality is not? The focus is on what the
institutions are saying, implicitly or explicitly, by virtue of the
way they’re designed.

NW: Why does this matter? I might think that all I need is toleration,
I don’t need respect.

NF: For me, the crucial question is this: ‘Is society organized
in such a way that everyone has the possibility to be a full
member, to participate in social interaction on equal terms with
others?’ Put differently, does society promote parity of participa-
tion? There are two possibilities: in one case, social institutions
enable full participation for all on terms of parity; in the other,
they prevent some people from participating fully, on a par with
others, in social interaction. In the first case, the society
promotes reciprocal recognition or status equality, while in the
second, it entrenches misrecognition or status hierarchy.

NW: Is there a psychological element here: if you respect somebody you
might actually bolster them in such a way that they’re capable of action;
whereas cumulative disdain may have the effect of stopping people doing
things in the public sphere.

NF: You’re hitting on an important and subtle point. What
you say is probably true, but what do we do about it? It could
be counterproductive to try to engineer politically correct
ideas about other people.

Let’s take an example. Suppose we had a society in which
the institutions really did adequately respect racial, religious,
and cultural minorities, and really did give everyone equal
chances of fair participation. But suppose too there were a
number of curmudgeonly, backward citizens who still
harboured, say, racist or anti-Muslim, sentiments.

I’m tempted to say, ‘Well, that’s a shame but nevertheless
the society in the design of its institutions has succeeded in
giving adequate recognition’, and my hope would be that ideas
would in the end follow institutional change.

There are other theorists of recognition, such as Charles
Taylor, who would disagree, and would put much more
emphasis on the psychological. But my view is that the essential
thing is not whether or not I feel hurt or disempowered by
others having a certain view of me.

Consider that I could be wrong in my feelings. On the one
hand, I could be oversensitive, imagining I’m being disres-
pected, when it’s not the case. On the other hand, I could be
thick-skinned, oblivious to the fact that I’m being denied the
standing of a full partner in social interaction, when in fact I
am. What these cases show is that the psychological element is
not decisive; I don’t mean to dismiss it entirely, but it’s not
crucial. What is crucial is how society actually works, whether
its organization fosters parity of participation or whether it
impedes it.

NW: How would this issue of recognition arise in a multicultural
society?

NF: We could take examples having to do with religion,
with gender, with sexuality. I mentioned the issue of marriage.
If society has a legal organization that defines marriage as a
relation between a man and a woman, then it denies gays and
lesbians the chance to participate fully in social life. That’s a
clear case of misrecognition or status hierarchy.

But there can also be other, less obvious kinds of misrecog-
nition. Suppose we have social welfare programmes that
implicitly favour wage earners over caregivers. This also sends
a message about what society values. When welfare institu-
tions work in a way that prevents women or other caregivers
from full participation, they too send a message of disrespect
or misrecognition.

You could also take the example of whose holidays are
treated as public holidays and whose are not, issues about
whether you have the public display of Christian crosses, as
opposed to Jewish stars or Muslim crescents. In other words,
what is given public recognition sends a message about who is
a first-class citizen and who, by contrast, is not.

NW: Well, take the marriage example; if you say a marriage is
between two people, that shuts off the religious groups who believe that
bigamy or polygamy is perfectly acceptable and even required. How do you
sort out whose view of the good life should be recognized?

NF: This is a truly difficult question. It could be that we have
to stretch our minds to get around this question. If I could
be convinced—and I’m not at the moment—but if I could be
convinced that polygamy could be dissociated from male
domination and patriarchy and that it was a genuine expres-
sion of autonomy of women or men who live that way, then
I might feel a lot less worried about it: I might be willing to
stretch and say that society should recognize that. Of course,
I would also want to make sure that children’s interests were
protected, and so on.

My idea is that, in so far as possible, we should translate
questions about the good life into questions about fairness.
Is anybody being dominated? Is anybody having something
thrust upon them that is not a genuine choice? Now, I don’t
think that every question can be translated into a fairness
question. There are still going to be value questions to decide.
But I don’t think it’s the role of the political philosopher to
give us the answer to those questions. What we as political
philosophers—or even as citizens and activists—should do is
to work to create conditions in which citizens can themselves
decide these value issues—through deliberation and argu-
ment, negotiation, and contestation. But, and here’s the
crucial issue, these decision-making processes will be
legitimate, and the results will be valid, only if the partici-
pants can interact as peers, only if their discussions proceed
on fair terms. And this is not the case today. On the contrary,
the debates that we have about these questions now are
tainted by severe power asymmetries; not everyone can really
participate on equal terms.

NW: One asymmetry arises in the democratic voting process—between
majority and minorities. Even if the majority of the minority vote in
favour of a certain outcome, they might still lose: they’re not going to
have their particular way of life acknowledged by the wider society. Is it
all going to come down to a democratic vote? In which case, aren’t
minorities going to be exploited?

NF: The key is to figure out what sorts of issues allow for
the peaceful co-existence of different forms of life and which
do not. In cases of the first sort, it is possible to pluralize
institutions, whereas cases of the second type require a
common public framework. So, for example, take the
question of nature. We have a general tendency, part of
modern western rationalism, to think of nature as relatively
valueless, as a supply of resources for human exploitation.

But at the same time, we have various religious communi-
ties, or in first-world nations, native communities, that have a
much thicker, more value-laden ethical view of nature. Now
it’s an interesting question as to whether these two can co-exist.
Because if the hegemonic view of nature as a valueless pool of
resources for exploitation is allowed free rein, it will surely
drive out the possibility that small communities of native
peoples can maintain ways of life that are based on different
ideas of nature.

That’s an example of a case where separation alone will not
suffice to ensure equal recognition. But where there are
different ethical conceptions that can co-exist and where all
pass the test that no one’s being dominated or exploited, then I
don’t see any reason why we shouldn’t just pluralize and let
people choose which one to affiliate to.

NW: I know you said that philosophers shouldn’t decide particular
cases, and that it should be done through negotiation of the people
involved. But there are practical issues where an agreed conclusion will
be impossible. For instance, with holidays: you can’t argue that every
group should be recognized by having their own public holidays—then
every day would be a holiday.

NF: Sounds good to me! There may be practical consider-
ations and constraints that prevent absolute symmetry. In
cases like that, in which you must institutionalize, say, a
majority preference, you will have to find ways in which the
minorities are not penalized—in which they are provided
compensation, exemptions, alternatives, etc.

NW: Doesn’t structuring society in a way that recognizes different
groups emphasize and entrench difference? It tells you that these people
need to be respected in this way and these other people need a different
kind of recognition?

NF: Well, every society necessarily institutionalizes some
recognition order, some specific pattern of cultural value. So
we will always live with value hierarchies: with some sense of
what a first-class and second-class citizen looks like.

It follows that the choice is not between recognition or no
recognition—it’s, rather, which recognition, or, if you prefer,
what counts as a fair symmetric equal respect form of recogni-
tion? That said, I share your concern about not wanting to
promote separatism. That’s why I’ve avoided analysing recogni-
tion in terms of identity, and why I’ve analysed it instead in terms
of status. For me, in other words, what requires recognition is not
one’s identity, but one’s status as a full partner in social inter-
action. That might sound purely verbal or semantic, but it’s not.
By putting the emphasis on interaction, it discourages us from
associating multiculturalism or recognition with separatism.
What we should care about is that people can interact with one
another on fair terms. The aim is not to encourage them to act in
little separated enclaves only with their own kind, but to ensure
that they can interact across differences as peers.

NW: Well we care about that, but there are presumably groups who don’t
care about that and would like to be separatists, would like to keep a corralled
area for their own way of life and not have any interference from outside.

NF: Absolutely right, and my approach does not entail that
everyone must participate in everything. What it does entail is
that we have an obligation to remove entrenched obstacles
that prevent people from participating, if they want to.

NW: So do you have a name for your approach?

NF: I call it the status model of recognition, where the
question is equal status, as opposed to identity. So my
approach offers an alternative to the standard identity model
of recognition, which focuses on the psychological and which
encourages identity politics.

Analysing recognition as a question of status raises all sorts
of interesting questions about the relation between status and
class, and that brings me back to what we started with: the
relation between questions of distribution, which I think of as
class questions, and those of recognition, which I think of as
status questions. In my view, these represent two analytically
distinct orders of equality/inequality, which do not always
coincide. They are practically intertwined, and they interact
causally, but they can’t be neatly mapped on to or reduced to
one another.

I oppose efforts to talk about multiculturalism in a way that
disconnects it from questions of socio-economic equality and
inequality.

NW: What you’re saying is that recognition of status is incredibly
important, but it has to be seen in connection with economic inequal-
ities. But what is the connection? Could you not have one without the
other?

NF: You could. Think about the very simple societies that
anthropologists used to analyse: the societies they called
‘primitive’ societies. They were societies in which you could
say everything was recognition: everything was organized in
terms of orders and structures of prestige, and what you
got—the question of distribution and economy—simply
followed from that recognition hierarchy.

And you could take the other extreme. Imagine a society in
which everything was determined by the market—prestige
simply followed automatically from how much you had. Our
society is not like either of those two extremes. We have to
deal with something more complicated: two analytically
distinct, practically intertwined orders of stratification
or domination. Too many current discussions of multicultur-
alism ignore the dimension of distribution and class, the
political economy side, and if you really want to understand
and redress inequality, you have to think about both orders
together.

NW: Some European politicians have been very pessimistic about the
future of multiculturalism in Europe. Do you share that pessimism?

NF: That’s a complicated question. It is true that we’ve seen
a huge backlash in recent years against diversity, against
toleration, against equal respect. I am indeed pessimistic that
this will turn around anytime soon. But I firmly believe that it
should turn around at some point. The backlash is connected
to the high levels of socio-economic insecurity that people are
currently experiencing, which again brings me back to the
relation between recognition and distribution. One way in
which these two dimensions of justice/injustice can be related
is this: people who feel that they’re on the losing side of, let’s
say, economic globalization—who feel that their forms of life
and their standing in society is threatened, will often react
defensively by insisting on their superiority in some other
respect. In the United States—where we have a long history of
racism—white racism gave poor white Southerners a sense of
being superior to somebody else, even though their economic
circumstances were miserable.
