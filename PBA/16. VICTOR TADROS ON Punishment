AND PUNISHMENT

VICTOR TADROS ON 
Punishment

David Edmonds: Should we punish an innocent person if by so doing
we could stop a riot and so save many lives? Most people would say no. Is
it a good thing, positively a good thing, for a guilty person to suffer?
I suspect people will have different intuitions about that. What we need is
a theory of punishment to help give consistent answers to such questions.
And law professor Victor Tadros is the man to supply it.

NW: The topic we’re focusing on is punishment. What sort of
punishment are we talking about?

Victor Tadros: We’re primarily focused on state punish-
ment: punishment of criminal offenders through the state-run
criminal justice system. We might also think about punish-
ment in other contexts, where there is no criminal justice
system. But we’re not primarily focusing on the punishment
of children for, say, paternalistic reasons.

NW: So, we’re talking about the kind of things that a criminal comes
face to face with in the courts of law, and so on. What are the main
philosophical justifications for punishment?

VT: Most people who work in the field identify two main
theories. One of them is consequentialism, which says that
you should punish offenders because it does more good than
harm. The main way in which it does this is that it deters the
criminal from committing further wrongs—and deters other
people from committing wrongs. And so, even though it’s bad
that we punish the offender and that the offender suffers,
overall it’s good because there will be fewer offences and less
harm to other people.

NW: That sounds convincing. What could be wrong with it?

VT: Well, imagine that I could punish an innocent person
and in doing so I would deter more wrongdoing. Consequen-
tialism looks like it’s going to permit me to do that. For
example, imagine that a rape has occurred and it’s very hard
for me to find the rapist. It would take lots of resources. But
I’ve got a person who looks like the rapist and I could punish
him. And if I punish him, then it would have a deterrent
effect—it would prevent more rapes. Even if it does more
good than harm, I think many people would baulk at the idea
of punishing an innocent man.

NW: People who defend consequentialism have a pragmatic response to
that criticism: they say that in real life cases, if it became public that an
innocent person was punished, that would bring about bad consequences
in itself: people would lose their confidence in the law. So although the
theory seems to support the idea that you can punish innocent people, in
practice, it wouldn’t work like this.

VT: It remains to be seen whether in practice you ever could
justify punishment on that basis, were consequentialism true.
I don’t think we can rule out the possibility that we could do
more good than harm by punishing an innocent person. You
might be a police officer and be very good at covering up a
person’s innocence. But also, I think, most people object to
this idea, not purely on pragmatic grounds, but on principled
grounds.

Most people believe that there are restrictions on harming
someone as a means for a greater good. Thus, imagine
punishing one innocent person to save five rapes from
occurring: the punishment deters five rapes. The consequen-
tialist will have to defend this punishment. But I think many
people will baulk at that conclusion, even in circumstances
where there are no pragmatic disadvantages in doing this.

NW: Ok. There goes the consequentialist theory. What’s the other
common approach in this area?

VT: The main alternative is retributivism. Retributivism holds
that we should punish people because they deserve to suffer. A
standard version of this view has two main components. The
first is that it’s a good thing when wrongdoers suffer, and the
second is that the state is permitted to carry out this good thing.
Normally, obviously, making people suffer is a bad thing, but
retributivists say making a guilty person suffer is good. We can
put it like this: the moral valence of making people suffer is
altered by wrongdoing. Whereas, the normal moral valence of
suffering is negative—suffering is normally a bad thing—in this
case, the moral valence is positive; the suffering of the offender
turns out to be a good thing.

NW: Well, psychologically, that seems a very common response. You
see it in the playground. You see it in many places. If somebody harms
another it seems right to get back at them in some way.

VT: I agree that many people have the instinctive reaction
that it’s a good thing when wrongdoers suffer. Think about
the bad guy at the end of a cowboy movie who gets what he
deserves: we all cheer when this person suffers. We even cheer
when the person gets killed. In the mid-twentieth century,
many philosophers considered this view barbaric. And my
sense is that those people in the mid-twentieth century were
just about right—this really is a barbaric view. It’s not plausible
to think that we should take pleasure or satisfaction at the
suffering of other people. But if it’s a good thing that of-
fenders suffer, that seems just how we should feel.

NW: So, although many of us might have the tendency to want to do
this, it’s something we should try and curb.

VT: Even if we thought that the suffering of bad people was a
good thing, I doubt that the state should bring it about. After all,
think about the way in which the state brings about the
suffering of people through the criminal justice system—it
spends an enormous amount of resources doing this. Now, try
and justify spending this enormous amount of resources simply
because you think that it’s a good thing that people suffer.
Haven’t we got anything better to spend our money on? Why
can’t we spend the money making good people much happier?

NW: So, if straightforward consequentialism fails, and retributivism
fails—what are we left with?

VT: Let’s return to the consequentialist thought that we
punish people in order to prevent other people committing
crimes. That thought seems right: the thought that the most
important end that punishment can achieve is to prevent other
people suffering the harms and wrongs of criminal offending.
We do this by deterring offenders and others from future
offending. So, I’m an enthusiast for deterrence. Deterrence is
the right kind of rationale for punishment. And in fact,
deterring wrongdoing is the only thing that could plausibly
justify the enormous amount of resources we spend on
the criminal justice system in the real world. By doing this, the
criminal justice system achieves something very important—it
protects people from having their rights violated.

Now, return to the weakness in the consequentialist
thought which says that you could punish innocent people in
order to achieve a greater good—that looks like a deficiency in
the consequentialist view.

The remedy for that deficiency, though, is not to think that
it’s wrong to punish people for deterrence reasons altogether,
but rather that it’s wrong to punish innocent people for
deterrence reasons. There might be constraints on punishing
innocent people, which don’t apply to guilty people. You’re
permitted to punish guilty people for reasons of deterrence.
You’re not permitted to punish innocent people for reasons of
deterrence. If we could justify that, we would have a view that
looks more attractive.

NW: It’s interesting that you focused on punishment to deter other
people. I would have thought that the primary role of punishment, in
many people’s eyes, is to stop the particular individual punished from
doing more of the same.

VT: And I agree that it’s permissible to punish people in
order to prevent them from committing further crimes, too.
The question is whether it’s permissible to do more than that:
to punish offenders in order to prevent other people from
committing crimes. That seems more controversial because
you’re harming one person as a means to prevent other people
from committing wrongs. Given that this person isn’t
responsible for the wrongs the other people commit, this is
going to be harder to defend.

But at the same time, it is very counterintuitive to restrict
our view of punishment to punishing this person solely to
prevent his or her own further wrongdoing. Imagine that I go
and commit a very serious wrong. Now I’m a reformed
character and I’m unlikely to commit another offence
again—well, on this view, there will now be no reason to
punish me. Or imagine, even more strongly, that I’m not a
reformed character but I just got what I want. Suppose, I want
to be rich and, through my crime, I’ve become very rich. Now,
it seems like there’s no reason to punish me anymore because
I’m not a threat to anyone. I’m quite happy living with all my
money that I gained through the crime.

NW: You could argue that if somebody won’t be reformed by the
punishment, then punishment is irrelevant. Some people would bite this
bullet: ‘This person committed this crime; they’ve had a dramatic
character change since then. There’s no danger to other people. There is,
therefore, no point in punishing them.’

VT: I don’t think this is an attractive position. Imagine a
person commits a rape, and they rape the only person that
they wanted to have intercourse with. And now, they’ve
had intercourse with that person, they don’t want to have
intercourse with anyone else. I don’t think it’s plausible to
think that this person isn’t liable to be punished anymore. And
that is true even if they regret what they did.

Let me try and explore why that might be true. Think about
the victim of the crime in this case. This person’s had her
rights violated by the offender. We might think about what the
offender owes to the victim in virtue of having offended. He’s
made her much worse off. He’s harmed her very severely.
What does he now owe her? Well, he owes her, at least,
compensation. Most people think that that is completely
uncontroversial—that when you wrongfully harm a person,
you at least need to compensate them for what you’ve done.

Rape, though, is very hard to compensate for, if not
impossible. Monetary compensation seems unsatisfactory.
And compensation, even full compensation, were that
somehow available, seems an insufficient response on behalf
of the offender. What else could the culprit do to compensate
the person for the rape that they’ve suffered? One thing they
could do is to protect this person against being raped by other
people. Imagine that there are other people around who want
to rape this person; the culprit, I think, owes a duty of
protection towards the person whom they’ve raped. As a
result, we can justify harming them to deter other people—we
can justify this to them in virtue of the fact that they are
harmed as a means to the end of protecting people. In virtue
of their wrongdoing, they have a powerful duty to serve this
end. So we are using them as a means only to serve an end that
they are themselves required to serve. I call this the ‘duty view’
of punishment, because the justification of punishment is
grounded in the duties that offenders incur in virtue of their
wrongdoing. Importantly, it justifies punishment by thinking
about the obligations that offenders have to respond to their
own wrongdoing. Justifying punishment to offenders,
I believe, requires that we think in this way. In considering how
we can act towards them, we should think first about the
reasons that they themselves have to respond to their wrong-
doing. We punish offenders to protect other people, but we do
it only because these wrongdoers must serve the end of
protecting people themselves.

NW: Wouldn’t it follow from that, that not only should they be
punished, but that they should be seen to be punished? In order for the
punishment to be an effective deterrent, other people have to be aware that
it is occurring. And the next step down that line is to end up with some
kind of public spectacle where the suffering of the criminal is broadcast to
everybody.

VT: I suspect that there was a time when punishment as a
public spectacle wasn’t completely irrational. I’m not sure that
hanging, drawing, and quartering people was ever justified.
But if deterrence is going to work, everyone must know that
offenders are punished for their crimes. There may have been
a time when spectacular public punishments were necessary
to achieve this.

But we should think about another consideration to take
into account in determining the mode of punishment. On the
view that I am outlining, the suffering of offenders is still to be
considered a bad thing. If we can punish the person in a way
that also benefits that person—say, through rehabilitative
techniques—then, we have very good reason to do this. In fact,
we’re going to achieve a double benefit. We deter criminals
because people don’t like punishment, even when it’s rehabili-
tative; and we also benefit the offender at the same time,
making them better off. Public spectacles are difficult to
reconcile with this ambition.

Now, the retributivist view, the view that thinks it is good
that wrongdoers suffer, won’t see any value in improving the
lives of offenders. The view that I’m outlining, which I call the
‘duty view’, is more humane than the retributivist view in this
respect. The retributivist thinks, ‘It’s great when wrongdoers
suffer. And, within the limits of proportionality, we should try
and make them as badly off as possible.’ The view that I
defend says, ‘If we can punish the person and deter crime, and
at the same time, make them better off—that’s what we
should aim to do.’

NW: You’ve already mentioned that you shouldn’t punish the
innocent, but what limits do you want to set on the kinds of punish-
ment that you can use to achieve the ends you think are legitimate?

VT: Another nice feature of the duty view is that it can
naturally explain proportionality. There are two ways of
understanding the idea of proportionality. One is aesthetic,
like when a window is well proportioned to a room. Another
idea defends harming a person in virtue of the good that
outweighs it. And on the view that I’m defending, it’s the
second kind of proportionality that we’re concerned with.
We’re permitted to harm people only if doing so is going to
bring out about a significant good.

Furthermore, there’s a cap on how much you can punish a
person. Return to the thought that a person incurs duties as a
result of their wrongdoing; what’s the scope of those duties?
Well, that depends on the gravity of the wrong. Imagine that
I steal one of your compact discs. How much do I owe you in
return for the compact disc in terms of protection against
other people stealing compact discs? Well, not so much that it
is permissible to kill me as a result. When we’re talking about
very serious wrongs, in contrast, we might be able to do much
more to the person to harm them in order to bring about a
greater good.

NW: But the key question is, how much more? Some people would say,
‘Look, if somebody’s murdered or raped, then capital punishment is the
correct response and entirely proportionate.’

VT: I don’t think that it’s obvious that we can rule out
capital punishment on principled grounds, though I do think
that the overall case against capital punishment is decisive.

There are some cases where it’s permissible to kill a person as
a means of preventing them from committing a wrong. And
perhaps we can extend that thought to punishment. Imagine
that I’ve hired a hit-man to kill you. The hit-man’s coming over
the hill with his automatic weapon. The only way in which you
can protect yourself against the hit-man is to pull me in front of
you as a human shield. Luckily for you, I’m standing beside you.
I take it that while it wouldn’t be permissible for you to use an
innocent person as a human shield to defend yourself against
this hit-man, it would be permissible to use me as a human shield
against this hit-man to save your life. And yet in doing so, I’ll be
killed as a means to protect you against the hit-man.

Punishment is a few steps further down the line from this kind
of case. We’re talking about a person being harmed to protect
people against threats that other people are going to perpetrate
against them. We’re talking about a person who’s already harmed
someone, rather than a person who will cause harm if nothing is
done. So, we’re not talking about exactly the same kind of case.
But I think that the differences between the kind of case that
I have outlined and capital punishment may not be decisive in
ruling out capital punishment in principle. Just to be clear, it may
be that the differences between the kind of defensive case that
I have outlined and capital punishment are sufficiently great to
rule out capital punishment, but that case has to be made.

But even if that case cannot be made, the death penalty is
very likely ruled out on pragmatic grounds. There are very
few people, at least in attractive countries to live in, like the
UK, who think that capital punishment would be very effective
in deterring homicide. The homicide rate is not very high. We
wouldn’t reduce the homicide rate in any very significant way
through capital punishment, so capital punishment is ruled
out on that basis. Countries that have high crime rates should
probably focus their resources on creating the conditions
where crimes are less likely to occur in other ways than on the
death penalty.

Finally, let me add that no theory of punishment inherently
rules out the death penalty—not the retributivist view, not the
consequentialist view.

NW: So, you’re saying that somebody who has a religious prohibition on
all killing should revise his or her views in relation to capital punishment?

VT: I think that sometimes it could be morally wrong not to
kill people. Imagine that a third party could protect you from
the hit-man coming over the hill. I’ve hired the hit-man. The
hit-man is going to shoot you if this third party does nothing.
The third party could easily pull me in front of you and
prevent you from being killed. I think this person has a moral
duty to pull me in front of you. And if they don’t do so,
I think their failure to help is seriously morally wrong. If it
was true that we had a duty to administer the death penalty to
provide people with sufficient protection against serious
criminal offending, I don’t think that religious conviction
would provide a person with a good reason not to do their
duty. But as I say, I very much doubt that there are good
reasons for the death penalty overall.

NW: In Britain we have a criminal justice system that’s partly based
on deterrence, partly based on retribution: how would you reorganize this
system to make it better?

VT: One thing it is important to grasp is that moving from a
theoretical model of punishment to the pragmatics of
punishment is no smooth ride. A reason against imposing the
death penalty, for example, is that institutions are not that
good at distinguishing between the innocent and the guilty.
If we were to try and make them better at this, they would be
enormously costly. So while philosophical work on punish-
ment should inform institutional design, we should not draw
conclusions about institutions too quickly from accounts of
the justification of punishment.

That being said, there are many ways in which the criminal
justice system in England and Wales is inadequate. Too much
is criminalized, and people are punished too much even when
they have violated legitimate criminal prohibitions. I suspect
that general deterrence grounds are insufficient to justify the
length of penalties that we have in England and Wales. We
have long penalties compared with other criminal justice
systems in Europe. There really isn’t sufficient evidence that
this is justified in terms of reducing the crime rate. Most of the
evidence suggests that while people are very motivated not to
get caught and punished, the length of sentence doesn’t make
very much difference to people’s conduct. So, it may well be
that we would retain a similar kind of crime rate with lower
sentences. But I am primarily a legal philosopher, and I am
quite conscious of my own limitations in speaking about
many of the practical difficulties involved in criminal justice
reform.
