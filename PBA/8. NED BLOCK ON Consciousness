MIND, SELF, AND
IMAGINATION

NED BLOCK ON 
Consciousness

David Edmonds: Ned Block is Professor at New York University of not
just one subject but three: Philosophy, Psychology, and Neuroscience. His
seminal work on consciousness combines all three elements. The problem
of what constitutes consciousness is as vexing as any in philosophy. Block
believes one can be conscious of something without realizing it. Sounds
counterintuitive? Let him explain.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we’re going to focus on is the problem of
consciousness. What is the problem of consciousness?

Ned Block: I don’t think there’s one problem of consciousness.
In fact, one of the interesting things about the neuroscience of
consciousness is that it’s come up with some problems that
we didn’t quite know we had. One of the most interesting such
problems is the problem of whether conscious perception is rich
or sparse. The reason we have this issue is because it’s been
discovered in psychology that people can, surprisingly, miss
obvious items in the space right in front of their eyes if they are
attending elsewhere. One interesting example that you can find
versions of on YouTube is of people asked to count the passes
between the white-shirted members of a basketball team
and ignore the black-shirted members. That’s a highly
attention-demanding task: lots of passes, it’s hard to count.
While they’re doing this, someone in a gorilla suit walks
across the stage right in front of their eyes, and a very large
percentage of the people report not seeing the gorilla. People
are very surprised when you then replay the video and then
they say, ‘Oh my god, I didn’t see that! It’s right in front of
me!’ Versions of this have been run with pilot simulators in
which pilots who are distracted don’t see oncoming planes
right in front of their eyes.

NW: What does that reveal about consciousness? It’s interesting, but
what does it show us?

NB: Not surprisingly, people disagree about what it shows
us. One theory is that we can be conscious of only a very small
number of things at once—the things we attend to. Another
view is that we have a rich visual field, but that only some of
the things in that visual field are accessed by us at any one
time: there’s a limit on access. What is certainly clear from the
science is that there’s a limit on the number of things that we
can hold in working memory and in that kind of access. But
what the disagreement is about is whether that limit on access
is due to a limit on conscious phenomenology or whether
conscious phenomenology is rich and access is sparse.

NW: I’m just trying to get clear what you mean here. Imagine we’re
standing in front of a picture with a flashlight. Shine this flashlight on
bits of the picture and they’re highlighted. Is that what visual conscious-
ness is like, highlighting part of the field? Or is it the whole thing?

NB: It’s the whole thing. The opposing view isn’t a spotlight
view; the opposing view is that there are, at most, four items
at any one time in that whole thing that are in working
memory and therefore conscious.

NW: This is really quite difficult because, for me, being conscious is
being aware of something and being able to articulate it. My starting point
would be that it must be like the flashlight lighting things up, even if it’s
four points; whereas, I think, you’re saying that you can be conscious of
something without being able to speak, or recognize, or communicate,
exactly what it is you’re conscious of.

NB: Yes. And to some people that sounds as if you can be
conscious of something that you’re unconscious of, and that
does sound like a contradiction. The resolution of the contra-
diction is that the word ‘consciousness’ is ambiguous. There’s
a sense that relates to access, and there’s a sense that relates to
the ‘what it’s like’ to have the experience. My opinion is that
we’re taking in a very large number of things consciously, and
we have that ‘what it’s like’ for a large number of things, even
though there’s only a limited number of things that we can
access. My argument for this is based on experiments. I don’t
think you can tell very easily by introspection whether the
sparse view is right or whether the rich view is right. Now, I
think people do feel they do see a lot of things at once but the
sparse theorists explain that using the refrigerator light
illusion. The idea is that someone might think that the
refrigerator light is always on because it’s on when you look.
Similarly, their story is someone might think they have a rich
visual field because whenever they attend to part of it, they
can report it and access it and think about it. So, they think
visual experience is sparse but it only seems to be rich because
of this refrigerator light illusion. My view is that it really is
rich and the limit is a limit on access. But I think that the
sparse-consciousness people are motivated by the point you
raised originally: that we just wouldn’t call it consciousness if
it weren’t available. Whereas my view is that consciousness is
a real kind: it’s a real thing that can be investigated scientific-
ally and we can find out something surprising about it.

NW: On your view, does that mean there’s no such thing as a subliminal
piece of information or input to consciousness?

NB: No. On my view, there are three different categories of
neural activations in the sensory areas. The bottom level is
subliminal, where it isn’t conscious in any sense but it does
affect our behavioural responses: it gets into the brain and it can
influence responses—that’s the subliminal category. Then, on
the other end, there’s the straightforward conscious category
that everybody would agree to: that you see it, you can think
about it, you can plan, you can use it to answer questions. The
difficult category is the one in the middle, where you have the
very strong activation—this is usually produced by inner
tension—that has some of the signs of consciousness, but it
doesn’t reach your mechanisms of reasoning and reporting.
There are a number of such cases that we have some reason
to think are actually conscious. The opposition thinks, ‘Well,
I can’t report it so it’s not conscious.’ That’s where the
disagreement lies.

NW: You mentioned earlier the case of the person in a gorilla suit who
runs across the basketball court and nobody notices. How would your
tripartite distinction explain that?

NB: The idea would be that the gorilla experience is
conscious. There is a conscious representation but it lacks the
kind of categorization that would allow it to get into the
reporting system. So it’s consciousness without cognitive
access.

NW: But it’s not subliminal because of the level of activation in the
brain which you might find out about through some kind of functional MRI
scan or something like that?

NB: It’s not just a matter of the degree of activation. There
are other features that are involved, including recurrent loops
in which one activation is connected to another activation.
So, that’s important, and it may be also important what the
oscillation frequency is. So, there are other factors; it’s not
just the degree of activation.

NW: I would never know that just by thinking about my own experience
because it just wouldn’t be accessible to me. There’s no way I can get to
‘read’ that experience and interpret it because it’s not being categorized, as
you put it.

NB: We have to distinguish ‘not accessed’ from ‘not accessible’.
What is certainly true is that there are some very strong
activations that are not actually accessed, though it might be
that, if you had changed your attention in that gorilla case, you
would have fully been able to report that gorilla—maybe even a
few seconds afterwards, or half a second afterwards. What is a
much more difficult question is whether there might be some
representations that are in this category of conscious but are
actually inaccessible. The example that I would give is the
example of what’s called visual spatial extinction. It’s usually
caused by damage to the attention areas in the right side of the
brain which control the left side of space. If these are damaged
in a particular way, the subjects, when looking straight ahead at
what’s called the fixation point, cannot report things on the left
side. Yet, surprisingly, if it’s a face on the left side, they show
activation in the fusiform face area—the area that registers
conscious perception of faces—almost exactly as if it were a
conscious perception, an ordinary conscious perception of
a face. Yet, they say they don’t see any face on the left. The hope
is that more work on these representations will give us a further
clue as to whether there might really be a representation of the
face on the left that is conscious but still inaccessible because
attentional mechanisms that would allow categorizing and
reporting are broken.

NW: Again, using the word ‘conscious’ there sounds almost contra-
dictory. It seems more like a non-conscious experience.

NB: I agree that it sounds contradictory but I think that it’s
important to get beyond that sounding to the real phenomena
involved. It may be that our ordinary categories don’t easily
allow us to see how that could be true, but if we think
consciousness is a real thing, then we have to allow it might be
present, even if it cannot be accessed. One way to put it is that
our ordinary concept of consciousness has two properties: it’s
a concept of something that is accessible, but it’s also the
concept of something that’s real. These can come apart. So
we have to allow for the possibility that something real might
not be accessible.

NW: What about the Freudian notion of the unconscious? Is there a
way in which you can explain the phenomena that psychoanalysts describe
as unconscious experience?

NB: That’s a very interesting question. I would argue that
Freudian unconscious images might actually be conscious in
the phenomenal sense that people actively supress disturbing
conscious images, and then, in the Freudian sense of
unconscious, they are unconscious, which means that these
images are inaccessible. So this is another illustration of how
it is that we really have two separate concepts here: a
concept that’s tied closely to accessibility and a concept
that’s tied closely to there being something that it’s like to
have the image.

NW: Is it possible that people who are in persistent vegetative states are
actually conscious in the sense you’ve just described?

NB: We do have a few cases found by Adrian Owen and
Steven Laureys in which a patient who is in a vegetative state
by the standard criteria—in a sleep–wake cycle and unable to
respond to any commands or track things in the environ-
ment—can follow instructions to imagine a certain situation,
and when they imagine that situation, they have the brain
activation characteristic of imagining it. We think they really
have conscious experience, and not just conscious experience,
but also some conscious control of their imagery involved in
that conscious experience. One of these patients later moved
up the hierarchy from vegetative to minimally conscious
state—which is a higher level—where there seemed to be
some indication that she realized that she was getting these
questions.

NW: This is all fascinating, and it could change the way we think
about what we are. But beyond that, does it have any impact? Is there any
further point to this philosophical speculation?

NB: Yes, I think it has considerable moral impact. One
dimension of moral impact is with regard to animals. There has
been a persistent question as to whether animals suffer. If they
don’t have any conscious experience, as some philosophers have
claimed, then, according to some philosophers, it’s alright to
treat them in a cruel way because, after all, you’re not causing
them any pain. But if they have conscious experience, for
example if the chicken has conscious experience, then just
because of that we’re obligated not to cause them pain.
A second area where it’s important is in the case of patients in a
vegetative state, like the ones we’ve just been discussing. If you
had a close relative who’s in a vegetative state and there’s some
discussion as to whether to pull the plug, I think you’d want to
know whether they’re having conscious experiences or not.
You might decide that, even if they were having conscious
experiences, their life wasn’t worth living, but still it’s relevant
whether they’re having conscious experiences.
