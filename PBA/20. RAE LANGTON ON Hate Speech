RAE LANGTON ON 
Hate Speech

David Edmonds: Should hate speech be outlawed? The use of the
‘N word’, say? In the US, extensive free speech is said to be guaranteed by
the First Amendment, but in Europe there are laws that restrict speech
targeting particular groups—racist speech, for example. Should America
be more like Europe? Yes, says Rae Langton of Cambridge University. The
mistake made by free speech fundamentalists is to regard speech as
nothing but harmless words.

NW: Could you say what hate speech is?

RL: I don’t want to propose a definition here, but when you
see how people have talked about hate speech, one important
idea has been that of words or pictures that do something
distinctive to members of a certain group of people. So, for
instance, the United Nations describes hate speech as inciting
or promoting hatred towards members of certain groups, or
inciting violence against them. It asks member states to have
legislation that will guard against that sort of speech. So that’s
one idea which we can think of as, roughly, hate propaganda.
Another idea which is important is the idea of ‘words that
wound’—where the thought is not so much propaganda but
assault. In this case, the hateful words are being used directly to
attack somebody, rather than to incite third parties to hatred.

NW: I think I understand what you mean by hate speech as
propaganda. This is presumably what was going on in the lead-up to
the Second World War with Nazi anti-Semitism, for instance, where
Jews were portrayed as rats. Certain sorts of words were used to
target that group, amongst others. Now, that’s different from what
you’ve called ‘words that wound’, although obviously it could wound.
It typically occurs in a one-on-one situation or is directed at a
particular individual. Could you say a little more about ‘words that
wound’?

RL: Hank Aaron, the baseball player, at the time when he
was about to overtake the famed Babe Ruth, received a huge
barrage of hate mail. The hate mail he received was like an
assault: it was full of uses of the N-word, of threats—‘my gun
is watching your every black move’—and of other epithets,
‘jungle bunny’ and the like. This was ‘speech’ that was
designed to attack him personally and would have been
psychologically devastating. But what I want to emphasize is
that, quite apart from the appalling psychological effects,
those words are being used to do something, just in the saying
of those words. What I have in mind here is a distinction that
J. L. Austin introduced, although he wasn’t interested in hate
speech. Austin wrote a book called How to Do Things With
Words, and he was interested in three different kinds of things
we do with our words. We use words that have certain
meanings, first of all; and the action we perform when we use
meaningful words is the ‘locutionary act’. We use words to
produce certain effects on our hearers too, and he called that
the ‘perlocutionary act’. But we also use words to do some-
thing very directly: this was the idea that at first he called a
‘performative’ and later came to call an ‘illocutionary act’.
What interests me when thinking about these different
dimensions of hate speech is how hate speech, both as
propaganda and as assault, can be understood as a certain kind
of illocutionary act. Of course, it is harmful in terms of its
effects, but it’s also harmful in itself.

NW: Could you just clarify that a bit by giving some examples of
illocutionary acts?

RL: Austin had some fantastic examples. Funnily enough, if
we’re interested in incitement to violence, one of Austin’s
own illustrations was the utterance, ‘Shoot her!’ Think about
one man saying, ‘Shoot her!’ to another man, with respect to
a woman who’s nearby. You could describe that in a number
of different ways. You could say he said ‘shoot’ meaning by
‘shoot’ to shoot with a gun, as opposed to a bow and arrow.
You could say by ‘her’, he meant the woman nearby. If you
describe it that way, you are describing what Austin called the
locutionary act. You could also describe what happened next.
The second man picked up a gun and shot the woman, let’s
suppose (I’m now embroidering Austin’s example). If that
happened, and that was your description of what happened,
that’s about the perlocutionary act, in Austin’s terms. But
Austin would think we’d left out something important: what
the first person did in saying those words, what illocutionary
act was performed. Perhaps the first man ordered the second.
But was it an order? Was it a piece of advice? Was it a
suggestion? Was it a joke? There are many different illocut-
ionary things that the utterance ‘Shoot her!’ could have
been, and if we don’t think about them we’re missing out on
what Austin took to be one of the most interesting dimen-
sions of language use.

NW: I’m interested in how this way of thinking about language sheds
light on hate speech.

RL: One feature of many of Austin’s examples is that it
makes a difference who is saying the words, and in what
context. Even in the example I just gave, perhaps it could only
have been an order if the first man was in a position of
authority relative to the second man. And for many of his
examples, such as ‘I hereby christen this ship the Queen
Elizabeth’, there’s a successful christening provided they have
got the champagne, and it’s the right speaker, and everything
else in the ceremony is in order. But, in another nice example
from Austin, suppose some ‘low type’ (‘low type’ was his
phrase by the way)—some ‘low type’ grabs the champagne
bottle and smashes it against the ship and says, ‘I hereby name
this ship the Generalissimo Stalin.’ We can all agree, says
Austin, that it would be ‘an infernal shame’; and we all agree
that it would not be a christening of the ship. So what this tells
us is that certain sorts of speech act can do certain things
when they’re said by a person in authority, and won’t do the
same things if they’re not.

Now, the reason I mention that example is that we can
easily think of cases where what’s being done towards
members of a certain group is done to them partly in virtue of
a kind of authority the speaker might have. We were
discussing Nazi Germany before, so when Der Stürmer, a major
anti-Semitic newspaper, published their hate-filled pictures and
essays, it made a difference that it was from an influential
paper that, it seems, had the official backing of the
government. It was authoritative speech that ranked a
particular group as inferior, ranked them as vermin, ranked
them as sub-human, and legitimated violence against them.
The notion of ranking certain groups as inferior, and
legitimating violence or discrimination—this sort of ranking
and legitimating is part of the illocutionary force of
propaganda. So, it’s worth thinking about who the speakers
are, and what their standing is. And it’s worth thinking about
the possibility that the speech might be doing more than just
expressing an unpleasant idea.

NW: Most discussions about hate speech are about the limits of
freedom of speech. Are there consequences from your approach to hate
speech? Is it just a matter of understanding it as language?

RL: There are different reasons why people think that free
speech should include freedom of hate speech. One is because
they are in the thrall of the idea that speech doesn’t do much.
You know, the idea that ‘sticks and stones may break my
bones, but names will never hurt me’. Then another reason
sounds like just the opposite: speech does a lot, it’s important
because it’s so powerful, and we need to have this power
always available to us. Thinking about speech in general, and
hate speech in particular, as a kind of act—a speech act—gives
us a way of understanding it as something more than inert
words. It helps us think of speech as a kind of ‘doing things
with words’ that’s continuous with our other actions. This
means that one common way of dismissing legislation
designed to restrict certain forms of hate speech is on a losing
wicket. Speech is not ‘only words’, to borrow Catharine
MacKinnon’s phrase. It’s not inert. When we use words, we’re
doing all sorts of things, especially if we are in a position of
power or authority. Moreover, what we’re doing is not simply
expressing ideas that might or might not be true. We’re acting.
We’re altering norms. We’re making certain things more
permissible than they were before. We’re making other things
less permissible than they were before. We’re authoritatively,
sometimes, saying that certain people are inferior. That is one
of the ways that structures of hierarchy are set up and
maintained.

NW: There are two different models of how this might play out in
terms of the law. In Britain, there are quite strict legal prohibitions on
what you can say in public. If what you say is racist or homophobic, you
may find yourself prosecuted. In the States, it’s more complicated because
of the history of First Amendment interpretation which protects extensive
freedom of speech. Are you saying that the British solution is better?

RL: The British solution, as you’re calling it, is a response to
the UN Convention that requires member states to have
some laws that will help prevent the spread of racial hatred,
which was drafted against the backdrop of a history of racial
violence and genocide. More recently, in Rwanda, radio
stations were taken over by Hutus calling the Tutsis ‘cock-
roaches’, and that campaign of hate speech was clearly part
of what instigated massacre. Now, the US is the outlier on
this. The US has not adopted this sort of legislation, in part
because they think it’s in conflict with the First Amendment
of the US Constitution. This is odd, because as far as
I can see, there is nothing in the Constitution itself that
should really prevent the US having laws that were more
similar to those that are in force in Europe—especially keeping
in mind that they also have the Fourteenth Amendment,
which requires them to respect the equality of citizens, and
equality is certainly something that anti-hate speech legisla-
tion cares about. There are already many restrictions on
speech, whether on false advertising, insider trading, or child
pornography. There are many things you’re not allowed to do
with words. But there is still this kind of fairy tale that the
First Amendment is absolute—anything goes. But of course, it
doesn’t. So, to my mind, the UK strategy is part of a relatively
sane European policy, that many different democratic
countries have signed up to in different forms.

NW: I’m interested in the part played by intention in so-called hate
speech. Hate is usually something you’re aware of; it’s directed at
somebody or something. Do you have to intend to harm somebody by your
speech for it to be hate speech?

RL: There are certain paradigm cases where your descrip-
tion would be completely accurate. Take the kind of assault-
like hate speech, the ‘words that wound’, that were sent to
Hank Aaron—those were deliberate, and it mattered that they
were deliberate. They were deliberately aiming to be words
that wound. But that mightn’t always be the case. There will
be some cases where what you do with your words might be
worse than you mean it to be, and in principle there could be
hate speech where people don’t know what they’re doing.
There’s so much that you could be unaware of, as a speaker.
Sometimes you’re not fully aware of the background struc-
tures of authority that influence the force that your speech is
going to have. If your speech has that force, it might be hate
speech, even when you don’t mean it to be.

NW: Generally, what you’ve been saying is that the way to think about
hate speech is not as a series of words that are uttered but people doing
things with words. If we think about people doing things with words, we
see that it’s just another kind of action, and so there isn’t really this
special category of ‘speech’ and we don’t need to separate out questions
about speech from questions about other kinds of behaviour.

RL: That’s a really good way to put part of what I want to
say. I do want to emphasize the continuities between speech
and our other actions. I do agree with those who think that
speech is special, though, in ways that don’t quite fit with
what you said. I agree with Mill that speech is important,
partly because communication is important. Part of what
makes me sad about the debates about free speech at present
is this. When people wave the flag for free speech, they
sometimes make communication harder, instead of easier.
When you allow a complete free-for-all for the most powerful
or authoritative speakers, this can hurt communication for
people lower down in the hierarchy. So if we are serious about
free speech, if we want everybody to have a chance to speak
more freely, that might mean taking active steps to let other
voices be heard.
