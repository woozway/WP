Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Again

METAPHYSICS, MEANING,
AND REASON

DAN SPERBER ON 
The Enigma of Reason

David Edmonds: Philosophers have traditionally celebrated reason:
Aristotle defined humans as ‘rational animals’. It is our ability to reason,
he thought, that sets us apart from other animals. But why did humans
evolve with a capacity to reason? What function does reason serve? The
obvious answer is that it helps us get at the truth and that has survival
value. But according to the French social and cognitive scientists Dan
Sperber (who is with us) and Hugo Mercier, it’s not as simple as that.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we are going to focus on today is the
enigma of reason. What’s that?

Dan Sperber: Well, reason is puzzling because, on the one
hand, it’s a cliché that this is what makes humans superior to
all other animals and that some of the greatest achievements
of mankind from science technology to law are based on our
capacity to reason. So you’d expect reason to function
particularly well. But when you do experiments on reasoning,
people, it seems, are rather bad at it. Another puzzling aspect
is that reason is supposed to be our best path towards truth,
and so it should cause people to converge on the same views
and ideas, but on the contrary it very often tends to polarize
positions and disagreements.

NW: Could you give an example of the kind of errors in reasoning
that people are prone to?

DS: Suppose I ask you to solve the following very simple
problem. A bat and a ball together cost £1.10. The bat is worth
one pound more than the ball, so how much does the bat cost?

NW: I guess £1.

DS: Well, are you sure? If it were £1, then the difference
between the two would be 90p, and I said that the difference
has got to be £1, and the total £1.10. So that can’t be the right
answer.

NW: So I guess the bat costs £1.05 and the ball costs 5p.

DS: Very good. The answer you’ve given now is given as the
first answer by only about 30% of the participants in experi-
ments where we pose that kind of problem. So intuition
doesn’t give us the right answer. What’s surprising is that even
if you give people time to reason before they give the answer,
what they do, instead of correcting their mistaken first
intuition, is use reason to confirm it. Across lots of experi-
ments, you give tasks that are logically fairly simple to resolve
like this one, and not only do people fail to give the right
answers, but if you give them time to reason and rethink their
answers they use reasoning just to confirm their initial hunch,
which is not what reasoning should be doing if it were a path
to a better solution or towards the truth. This is an example
of what is known as the confirmation bias. Once you have a
certain view, an opinion—either because that is what you have
been told or because it is your first guess—you use reasoning
to confirm this opinion, not to correct it, not to go beyond it,
but just to find further arguments to reinforce your own bias.

NW: That makes it sound as if the role of reason is rationalization,
not the discovery of truth.

DS: Well that’s the suspicion! People use reasoning to
confirm the biases or opinions they already have. The issue is
why would you do that?

NW: Given the fallibility of reasoning and the difficulty of explaining
what its role is, has anybody come up with a plausible account of what its
purpose is?

DS: There are several hypotheses. First, some psychologists
are content to assume that human reasoning is just not
very good, and that’s that. We may think of ourselves as
great reasoners, but in fact we are not. But that does not
make much sense: why should we deploy this costly mental
activity in reasoning? In contrast, intuition is fast and almost
effortless and, it seems, is not more error-prone than
reasoning itself.

Apart from the idea that reasoning is just not very effective,
another answer that has been suggested is that the biases we
exhibit in reasoning in many situations serve us well: it is
only in special situations that reasoning fails to provide the
right answer. That view is correct to a certain extent, but more
about inference in general than about reasoning proper. Our
mechanisms of inference on the whole serve us reasonably
well, but they sometimes fail abjectly. The problem, again, is
that our low-cost mechanisms of intuitive inference serve us
well in ordinary situations and that reasoning proper does not
seem to do better. Reasoning is a costly mental activity which
we seem to use just to confirm our intuitions.

NW: So what is your solution? What is the way out of this enigma?

DS: The enigma comes from the underlying assumption
that reasoning is something that serves individual cognition,
that it is a way for each of us in our individual thinking to
reach higher and better levels of understanding, a better grasp
of the way the world is, and better decisions. What Hugo
Mercier and I have tried to argue is that the function of
reasoning is not to enhance individual cognitive capacities, it’s
to play a role in social interaction, more specifically in
communication.

Humans depend massively on communication with others.
To become a competent adult and to lead your daily life, you
typically depend on communication with others in lots of ways,
from moving around to deciding what to eat, where to go, and
so on. You probably read the newspaper this morning, looked at
news on television or the Internet, discussed what’s going on
with your friends or your partners, and we do that all the time.
So we depend massively on communication with others.

Other people have a lot of information that we don’t have
and we can benefit immensely from them. On the other hand,
they each have interests that are, at least in part, different from
our own. They communicate not just out of sheer altruism, to
serve our interests, but to influence us—sometimes for our
good, but also so that we will see them in a better light, agree
with them, do what they want us to do, and so on. So in order
to get the best out of communication, we have to exercise
some degree of what can be called ‘epistemic vigilance’ to try
to believe all the information that is given in good faith by
competent speakers, while remaining aware of the possibility
of speakers being incompetent or aiming to deceive us, or at
least manipulating us.

So, if I am vigilant, how can you convince me of something
that I won’t believe just on trust, just because you said it? Well,
you can argue for it, you can present reasons. That is where
reasoning comes on the scene. You can give me highly
acceptable premises and show me that if I accept these
premises, the conclusion that I would not accept at first
follows from them. That is what reasoning does: reasoning
often allows us to go beyond the bottleneck of insufficient
trust. On our view, the basic function of reasoning is to
produce arguments and to evaluate arguments in order to
overcome trust bottlenecks in communication.

NW: I can see there’s a social role for giving reasons, but if giving
reasons doesn’t reliably lead to the truth, why would this social encounter
be more likely to produce truth than just an individual on their own
making mistakes due to relying on their reasons?

DS: We are not thinking of reason as a way to take us to the
truth, but reason as a way to convince others, and, from the
point of view of an audience, as a way to be convinced on
good grounds but not otherwise. From the point of view of
the communicator, reasoning is a way to convince a reticent
audience. From the point of view of the audience however,
reasoning is an ability to evaluate arguments, an ability that
may help both eliminate a number of errors or misleading
information and recognize good arguments.

So, again, the claim on this view is not that reasoning is
there to get at the truth: reasoning is for overcoming trust
bottlenecks in communication. But it does have relevance to
resolving the enigma of reasoning and to explaining the
fantastic achievements of reasoning, for instance, in the
sciences. What happens in a dialogical situation, in a situation
where people have different views and argue in order to
convince one another is that you get a kind of social division
of cognitive labour. You present arguments which may not be
that good and I will criticize them; I will perhaps present other
arguments which you will criticize. And if we have a common
interest in truth, the chances are that we will converge on it,
and, in fact, there is experimental evidence to that effect. This
is the same kind of reasoning experiment as the bat and ball
problem which people are pretty bad at solving individually,
when you put them in a group of three or four people none of
them necessarily has the solution initially. They start produ-
cing their own solutions while criticizing those of the others,
and they are not satisfied as a group until they’ve found the
right solution. Groups perform much better than individuals
in resolving these reasoning problems.

NW: That sounds like an ideal philosophy seminar. Philosophers are
often caricatured as thinkers in ivory towers on their own scratching their
heads, but in reality they are often in dialogue, as we are now.

DS: Absolutely—and not just philosophers, but scientists
too. These are highly competitive activities, where people are
trying to argue for the hypotheses that they put forward as
well as they can, and also to find fault with the hypotheses of
others, and where only the best hypotheses tend to survive.
I want to stress that I’m not trying to say that the function of
reasoning is to ensure a collective convergence towards the
truth, but the function of reasoning is to allow us to provide
and evaluate arguments in communication which can under
certain conditions cause a group of people to converge on the
truth, move towards better knowledge. Under other condi-
tions it can create polarization. So if you take a group of
people who start with near-identical views, let’s say a religious
group, and now they start reasoning, they reason in favour of
the same opinions and against people of different opinions
who are not there to respond. What will happen is polariza-
tion: they will just become more fanatical, set in their views,
and are highly susceptible as a group to the confirmation bias.

NW: Does your theory have any practical implications?

DS: Let me give you two examples where it does have an
impact. One is in education. There’s a lot of wonderful work
showing that children learn much better if they are given the
chance to argue about the subject matter at hand. If you just
teach them what they should end up knowing, they are not that
good, but if you put it in a problematic form and encourage
them to take different points of view, and then to argue among
themselves, not only do they tend to come to a better solution,
but they also learn it and internalize it much, much better. The
second example is from the political sphere. There’s great
interest in what’s now called deliberative democracy and the
precise importance of discussion, debate, and so on. Political
engagement is not just voting and delegating your power and
authority to an elected official, but involves deliberating as
much as possible on the issues.
