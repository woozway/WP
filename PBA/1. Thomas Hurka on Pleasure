Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Again

Thomas Hurka on Pleasure

David Edmonds: Pleasure is unquestionably one of the good things
in life. But how do we contrast pleasure with other human goods, like
knowledge or accomplishment? How do we compare different types of
pleasure? And what is the link between pleasure and happiness? The
American philosopher Robert Nozick imagined an Experience Machine
that could give us whatever pleasurable feelings we might want and, once
plugged in, we wouldn’t know whether or not these experiences were real.
We might believe we were eating a chocolate éclair, though the delicious
­sensation was actually caused by wires attached to our brain. The
question Nozick asks is this: Would you choose the machine over real
life? He thinks you wouldn’t, and that this shows that pleasure is not as
important as thinkers like the late-eighteenth-century British utilitarian
Jeremy Bentham believed it to be. Our guide around the concept of
pleasure is Thomas Hurka—Professor of Philosophy at the University
of Toronto.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we’re going to discuss is pleasure.
Pleasure’s a good thing isn’t it? That’s fairly obvious.

Thomas Hurka: I hope so. A lot of us are wasting our time if
it’s not a good thing. But I take it there’s a strong intuitive sense
that pleasure—by which I mean all kinds of good feeling, any
sensation, any internal feeling that feels good or has a positive
buzz—is a good thing. People use different words for different
types of good feeling: ‘pleasure’, ‘contentment’, ‘enjoyment’,
‘happiness’. I include all of that, and I think, yes, feeling good
is good.

NW: But feeling good comes in different varieties. It’s not all the same 
kind of thing, surely?

TH: That’s what I want to talk about. I think the classical
utilitarians like Jeremy Bentham thought that pleasure was
just one thing—there were these ‘pleasure pellets’, as it were.
But I think there are different types of good feeling. When
I say that pleasure is good, I don’t think it’s the only good
thing. So, the best life is not necessarily the most pleasant
life. Achievement is a human value; knowledge is a human
value; being a morally good person is a human value; but
pleasure is also a human value, and I don’t think we could
imagine a good life without pleasure. It’s an essential
element. But, as you suggested, there are different types. The
first distinction is between pleasures that are simple feelings
and aren’t about anything, on the one side; and pleasures
that are about something—that are ‘pleasures that’—on the
other. So, let’s say you’re eating a chocolate. You close your
eyes and you concentrate on the feeling. You’re getting the
pleasure—it’s the wonderful pleasant sensation of rich
creamy chocolate—but you’re not pleased about anything.
You’re not pleased that something is the case. It’s just a
sensation that feels good.

NW: So what you’re saying is that these simple pleasures are really
just sensations—good sensations.

TH: Each one of them will be a complex sensation with a
dimension of pleasantness, but also other elements that make
one pleasant sensation different from another. So, the eating
chocolate pleasure will be a combination of pleasantness and
chocolate taste and rich, creamy feel. And the lying-in-the sun
tanning pleasure will be the dimension of pleasantness and the
hot sand underneath one’s body, warm-glow-on-the-skin
sensation. So each of them will be a total package that’s
different, but each will have this dimension of pleasantness.
You can never experience pleasantness on its own: it’s always
got to be with something else.

NW: So what’s the other case? The case of pleasure that something.

TH: Well, that’s when you’re pleased that something is the
case. You have a thought that something has happened in
the world—or will happen—and you’re pleased that that
will happen. So, you can be pleased that Liverpool just
scored five minutes ago. You can be pleased that your child
has just started to walk. You can be pleased that people
seemed to like the lecture you just gave, and they asked
smart questions at the end of it. So, you’re pleased that
something is the case. That’s more complex than a simple,
physical sensation, because you can’t be pleased that
Liverpool scored five minutes ago unless you have the
thought that Liverpool scored five minutes ago. We might
think that animals, for example, can have simple physical
pleasures: they can eat meat and get the pleasure of eating
meat. But they can’t have the pleasure that Liverpool scored
unless they have the thought that Liverpool scored, and
most animals can’t do that.

NW: So, we’ve got the distinction between simple pleasures, like eating
chocolate, and pleasures like the pleasure that Liverpool just scored. Is that
the whole range of pleasures we have available to us?

TH: No. I think there’s another distinction, independent of
that and cross-cutting against it, between what you can call
specific pleasures and more general—or extended—pleasures.
So let me take that first on the side of the simple pleasures
which are not ‘pleasures that’. If you take a physical pleasure,
like eating chocolate or sun-tanning, it’s often localized in
part of your body. So, you feel the pleasure of sun-tanning-
on-your-back, or the pleasure of eating chocolate in your
taste organs. And similarly, pains are often localized: you
have a pain in your right elbow, or an ache in your left thigh.
So those are localized and they’re also discrete elements in
consciousness. You can have several of them at the same
time: you can have the ache in your right elbow and the
pleasure of sun-tanning while eating chocolate and having
soreness in your left thigh, all at once. They’re discrete
elements in consciousness. The more extended simple
pleasures are the ones of being in a good mood. You just
feel generally up; you feel generally elated. Now, that’s not
localized. You don’t feel in a good mood in your left elbow
or in your right thigh. It’s not physically localized and it’s
not just a discrete element of consciousness, alongside
others, either. It permeates consciousness. Your whole
mental state is permeated with this feeling of being up.
Again, there can be differences of intensity: you can be in a
slightly good mood, or you can be elated, which is in an
intensely good mood. Moods are different from physical
pleasures in that they spread through consciousness—they
pervade it, they’re the background to all the other mental
states, like a blue wash on a painting that colours everything
slightly blue. And, of course, the opposite is a bad mood
or depression, where a negative feeling permeates your
consciousness.

NW: So moods are very general and not about anything, in contrast with
emotions which are about things.

TH: That’s right. So, when we talk about a good mood,
that’s more general—more extended—than a physical
pleasure, but we’re still on the simple sensation side, rather
than on the ‘pleasures that’ side. There’s also a more general
or more extended kind of good feeling that you can have
on the ‘pleasures that’ side. What I’ve mostly described are
pleasures that very specific things have happened. So I’m
pleased that Liverpool just scored, or I’m pleased that my child
just learned to walk, or that people appreciated the lecture
I just gave. But I could take ‘pleasures that’ in much bigger
objects, and a very important one is being pleased, or feeling
satisfied, with my life as a whole. I look at my life as a whole
from its earliest stages to now and projecting into the future,
and I’m not looking at just one aspect of my life, I’m looking
at my personal life, my career, my hobbies and activities, my
friendships—all those things. Taking the whole package and
looking at my life as a whole, I feel good about it. I’m pleased
that my life has gone the way it has. That’s a pleasure that; I’m
pleased that something is—or has been—the case. But it’s
not just Liverpool scoring, it’s something much bigger: it’s my
life as a whole. So we have, if I can just outline the four-part
distinction: (a) simple and localized pleasures—those are
physical pleasures; (b) simple and extended pleasures—that’s
an overall good mood. Then we’ve got: (c) the ‘pleasure that’
and particular—pleasure that Liverpool has just scored; and
(d) the ‘pleasure that’ and more extended—I feel satisfied with
how my life as a whole has gone and will go. Those are all
ways of feeling good, but they’re different.

NW: So, we’ve got the taxonomy now. But how do we compare these
different pleasures?

TH: I’m going to be a little bit Benthamite again because
I think that they involve good feeling. They all involve a
positive buzz, and that buzz can be more or less intense. My
thought is: all that matters is how much buzz you get. Now,
that’s not what everybody has thought. If you just think
about the words we use in English, ‘pleasure’ sounds a
little tawdry: ‘He devoted his life to pleasure’—well, that’s
not what you’d say by way of praising somebody. But
‘happiness’ has much more positive connotations: ‘I want to
be happy’—that sounds better. People have often used the
word ‘happiness’ for the more extended of those four types
of good feeling. So, I think you’d be more likely to call
somebody happy if he’s in an overall good mood; if he’s just
overall feeling good, you’d be inclined to call him happy.
Whereas, if he’s just getting a specific pleasure from eating
chocolate, you’d say, ‘Well, that’s pleasure—but it’s not
happiness.’ Likewise, if someone is pleased that Liverpool
has just scored a goal or that his daughter has learned to
walk, you wouldn’t say that that makes him happy. But if
someone has got a good feeling about his life as a whole,
I think we would be inclined to say that he or she is happy.
A lot of philosophers have defined happiness as satisfaction
or a good feeling with one’s life as a whole. So, if you use
the word with positive connotations for the more extended
forms of good feeling, I think that’s trying to get us to believe
that those are better. But I’m not persuaded by that. Think of
the song, ‘Any love is good love’—well, any good feeling is
good feeling! What matters is just its intensity.

NW: So you’re saying that pleasure’s good however you get it. It seems
to follow from that, that somebody who engages in the very simple, basic
pleasures and has lots of intense experiences is living as pleasurable and
happy a life as someone who engages in much more cerebral, intellectual
pursuits.

TH: I’m not going to say that the first person is leading as
good a life, because pleasure is not the only good. But if you
ask how much pleasure—how much good feeling—is there in a
life, the answer might be: it’s just as good as the more cerebral
life that you describe. Let me give you a pair of contrasts. On
one side, there’s a sensualist—a Don Giovanni—who spends
his life eating glorious meals and having wonderful erotic
adventures, but he’s not convinced that he’s leading the best
life. He has pangs of guilt about what he’s doing and therefore
he doesn’t feel much life satisfaction; he doesn’t feel good
about his life as a whole. Nonetheless, he has all these intense
particular pleasures. And on the other side, we have an ascetic
monk. He eats bread and water, he gets very few physical
pleasures; but, on the other hand, he has a persistent feeling of
contentment—not intense contentment, but an overall
persistent, good mood permeating his consciousness. He is
doing what he thinks is right; he’s serving his God and he feels
life satisfaction. He’s not jumping up and down, but he feels a
quiet sense of satisfaction with how he’s living his life. These
people have pleasures of very different kinds but it’s possible
that, if you ask whose life has the most pleasure, there’s no
answer. They’re equal, or roughly equal; you can’t say that
one has a more enjoyable life or a more pleasant life, or a life
with more good feeling than the other. The sensualist—the
Don Giovanni—has all these intense physical pleasures, not
much pleasure of a good mood, not much extended ‘pleasure
that’. The ascetic does have a persistent good mood and life
satisfaction, but he doesn’t have many physical pleasures.
What one gets in one form of pleasure, the other gets in the
other. It may be that, at the end of the day, they’ve led equally
pleasant, enjoyable lives in their very different ways.

NW: We’ve just been talking about pleasure regardless of how it’s
caused, but in real life it matters how pleasure is caused. If I get my pleasure
from torturing animals, that’s not a good thing.

TH: I couldn’t agree more. We’ve been talking about
pleasure as one good thing in life, and I’ve said that I don’t
believe it’s the only good thing. There are other elements
of a good life, such as achievement, knowledge and under-
standing, certain kinds of personal relationships, and also
being a morally good person. So, to take Bentham’s famous
remark that ‘quantity of pleasure being equal, pushpin
is as good as poetry’ (pushpin was an eighteenth-century
game like tiddlywinks), it might be true that, as far as the
pleasures involved, the two are equally good; but poetry
involves the exercise of intellectual capacities, understanding,
sympathetic feeling, that are additional to the pleasure and
give the activity of reading poetry much more value than an
equally pleasurable playing of pushpin. It goes even further.
You were talking about someone getting pleasure from
torturing animals. Well, I said that being a morally good
person is another good thing and, of course, being a morally
bad person—being vicious—is a bad thing. If you take pleasure
in some other being’s pain—sadistic pleasure, let’s say, in an
animal’s or another person’s pain—that might have some
positive value in so far as it’s pleasant. But it also has negative
value: it’s evil in so far as it’s malicious and involves a positive
attitude of wanting and taking pleasure in something evil,
namely someone else’s pain. So, it’s good in so far as it’s
pleasant, and bad in so far as it’s vicious. First, that makes
it worse than equally intense pleasures that don’t have an evil
object; and also, if the pain that one takes pleasure in is a great
pain, then the sadistic pleasure is, on balance, evil: its badness
in so far as it’s vicious is greater than its goodness in so far as
it’s pleasure.

NW: It’s very clear from what you’ve said that, although you’re very
interested in pleasure and see pleasure as one of the good things in life,
you’re not a utilitarian. You reject the idea that the only good thing
possible, for a human being, is pleasure.

TH: Yes, I’m not a utilitarian and I’m not—more specifi-
cally—a hedonist about value. Two major objections to
hedonism traditionally are first about mindless pleasures and
second about morally vicious pleasures. So, mindless pleasures
are the pleasures of pushpin as against poetry, the pleasures of
the Deltas and Epsilons in Brave New World, or the pleasures
of people in Robert Nozick’s Experience Machine. If all that’s
valuable is pleasure, then pushpin is as good as poetry. The
Deltas and Epsilons who say, ‘We’re all happy here’, actually
have the best lives, and we should all go on the Experience
Machine. But most of us don’t think that. We think that a life
that is less pleasant but involves real activity and real accom-
plishment, real knowledge and understanding of your place in
the world—rather than delusion—is a better life than one that
is more pleasant, but lacks those additional goods. So, I reject
hedonism or utilitarianism, first of all because it values
mindless pleasures at the same level as activities that involve
challenge and the exercise of skill and so on. The second
objection concerns morally vicious pleasures because a strict
hedonist thinks that a torturer’s pleasure in his victim’s pain
only makes the situation better. If the torturer’s pleased by his
victim’s pain, we should applaud—that’s better than if he was
indifferent to the victim’s pain, or worst of all if he was pained
by it. Hedonism also thinks that there are no good pains. But
if you’ve suffered some tragedy, and I feel compassionate pain
at your suffering or your loss, isn’t that a good thing? I would
say it’s a good thing, because compassionate pain at your
tragedy is a morally fitting or appropriate response to something
evil that’s happened to you, and on that basis it’s good. But
hedonism says: ‘No. It’s best not to feel pain at other people’s
tragedies. That’s just wasted pain. You should, if anything,
forget about it or, if possible, feel pleased by it.’ But that’s hard
to believe—or at least I can’t believe it.

NW: But pleasure is good. How do we weigh it against these other
goods in life?

TH: You’re ending on a killer difficult question. There is no
simple answer to that because we’re talking about completely
distinct objects of value: pleasure on the one side, knowledge
and achievement on the other. I think pleasure is good, but I
think that other things tend to matter more. And one of these
things is the form of virtue that involves being pleased by good
things. So, if you lead a life that has all the other values in
it—you have understanding of the world around you, you
seek difficult goals and achieve them, and you’re morally
virtuous—then one aspect of your moral virtue will be that
you’ll be pleased to have knowledge and understanding of the
world around you, you’ll be pleased at all your achievements,
and your life will contain pleasure. This pleasure will be
valuable partly because it’s pleasure. But I think it will be more
valuable because it’s appropriate pleasure in something else
that’s good, namely your understanding and your achievement.
So, you’ve asked me a difficult question, and some philosophers
might come in here and say, ‘Well, you know, knowledge and
achievement, those are good, but what really matters is feeling
good so long as it’s not horribly vicious, and so long as it’s not
completely mindless.’ I’m more at the other end. If we have
Nozick’s Experience Machine—we’ve all got it at home—some
philosophers would say, ‘The minute you get home from work,
your life will be best if you spend lots of the evening on there.’
Well, I would say, ration it the way you ration your kids’
TV and Internet time. It’s of some value, but if it’s interfering
with achievements and personal relationships to any significant
degree, it’s taking away from other things that are more
valuable.
