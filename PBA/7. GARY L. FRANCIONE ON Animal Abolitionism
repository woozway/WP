Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Again

MORALITY

GARY L. FRANCIONE ON
Animal Abolitionism

David Edmonds: Some philosophers change the world. Peter Singer’s
writings helped launch the animal welfare movement, sometimes called
the Animal Rights Movement. Singer believed that we should take animal
suffering seriously, that to dismiss animal pain, merely because it was
animal and not human, was what he called ‘speciesism’. Gary Francione
of Rutgers University argues that Singer, and those like him who want to
improve animal welfare, are utterly misguided, but not because they’re too
radical, quite the contrary.

Nigel Warburton: We’re going to talk about animal abolitionism.
Perhaps you could just begin by explaining what that is.

Gary Francione: A little bit of history: for the past 200 years,
our approach to animal ethics has been the animal welfare
approach, the notion that it’s alright to use animals as long as
we treat them ‘humanely’. This goes back to Jeremy Bentham.
Bentham argued that animals can suffer, and that this suffering
is morally relevant, but that animals aren’t self-aware—they
don’t care that we use them, they only care about how we use
them—and so we could continue to use animals as human
resources as long as we treated them in a ‘humane’ manner.
We cannot inflict ‘unnecessary’ suffering. But we don’t
question use; we only discuss treatment. The modern animal
movement is still stuck in that paradigm. If you look at the
modern animal movement, which is dominated very much by
the thinking of Peter Singer and these large animal charities
that follow Singer’s approach, no one is really challenging the
use of animals. They’re saying instead that we need to engage
in compassionate consumption—‘happy’ meat, free-range
eggs, things of that nature—and that really, the difference
between the classical animal welfare view and the modern
animal protection position, or whatever you want to call it, is
that we’ve got to do a better job in providing ‘humane’
treatment, that we haven’t done a very good job, we need to
do it better. With the abolitionist approach that I’ve been
developing, the primary component is that we really can’t
justify any animal use, and ‘humane’ treatment is a fantasy, on
a par with Santa Claus, Easter Bunny rabbits, and things of
that nature: silly. Humane treatment is impossible.

NW: The welfare approach seems quite plausible to me. We know that
animals have different kinds of capacities for suffering; they don’t all have
the same nervous systems. Higher mammals are presumably much more able
to suffer in a way analogous to human beings than, say, an invertebrate.
What’s wrong with that approach?

GF: Most of the animals we exploit are unquestionably
sentient. I don’t think we can say that the suffering of animals
who are closer to us counts more than the suffering of other
sentient beings, without begging the question about whether
we can justify attaching greater moral weight to animals who
are more ‘like us’, any more than we can attach greater weight
to the interests of humans based on race or sex. And as far as
our conventional wisdom on animal ethics is concerned, that
sort of similarity shouldn’t matter anyway. Most of us accept
that we shouldn’t inflict unnecessary suffering on animals.
What do we mean by that? We could have an interesting
discussion about what necessity means, but if the principle
that we should not inflict unnecessary suffering means
anything, surely it means that we shouldn’t inflict suffering for
reasons of pleasure, amusement, or convenience. Well, that
rules out about 99.99999 per cent of our animal use, which is
transparently frivolous. When you are deciding what to eat
tonight, you won’t be in any situation of compulsion or
necessity, you’ll be making decisions, life-and-death decisions,
based on nothing more compelling than palate pleasure.
When you choose clothes, your decision will be based on
fashion sense, or things of that nature. As a matter of fact, the
use of animals in experiments, which I object to completely, is
the only use of animals that is not transparently frivolous.
Everything else is transparently frivolous. So, therefore, if we
take seriously the notion that we are not to inflict unnecessary
suffering on animals, and we apply it to the issue of animal
use, rather than beg the question and assume that wholly
unnecessary uses are acceptable, the first thing we’ve all got to
do is go vegan. We kill 56 billion land animals each year—that
doesn’t include aquatic animals. None of that is necessary.
We’re not in a situation where it is us or them. There’s
something peculiar about talking about the moral status of
animals when we’re killing and eating them and have no good
reason whatsoever.

NW: But isn’t an amoeba much closer to a plant in terms of its capacity
to feel pain than, say, a chimpanzee?

GF: I don’t think an amoeba is sentient. By sentience I mean
subjective perceptual awareness. It may be difficult to draw the
line. I recently have been having discussions with people about
molluscs—these may be difficult cases. I don’t eat any molluscs
because I err in favour of assuming that they’re sentient: there
seems to be some evidence for that. When I walk, I try not to
walk on grass so that I don’t kill insects. I don’t know whether
insects are sentient, but I do know that fish and lobsters and pigs
and cows and chickens, and all of the animals we routinely
exploit, and all of the mice and rats that are used in laboratories,
they are all sentient, perceptually aware, they value their lives,
they have an interest in continuing to live: that is, they prefer,
desire, or want to continue to live.

NW: One of the common arguments in this area is that human beings
have language and a capacity to reflect on their own experience, and that
puts them into a special moral category. What you’re suggesting is that
we should lump all sentient beings together.

GF: Yes and no. I’m not saying that cognitive characteristics
don’t matter morally under any circumstance; I’m saying that
for purposes of use as a resource, they don’t matter. Let’s
assume you have a normal human being and a human being
who has transient global amnesia, with no sense of the past,
no sense of the future, but a strong sense of the present right
now. Or you can have someone who has Alzheimer’s, who has
no sense of the past, no sense of the future, but a strong sense
of self in the present. Is that person self-aware? Yes. Does that
person have an interest in continuing to live? Yes. Is that
interest in continuing to live different from your interest and
my interest? The answer is probably yes. Is it morally relevant?
Maybe. Somebody who is mentally disabled, someone who
has cognitive impairment of a particular degree may be
someone you don’t treat in the same way as someone who
doesn’t have an impairment. You may not want to give that
person a driver’s licence. If you’re looking for a history
lecturer, you might not want to appoint somebody who has
got transient global amnesia, but if the question is not
whom do we hire to be a lecturer but whom do we use as a
forced organ donor, or as a non-consenting subject in a
biomedical experiment, the answer is you don’t use either of
them. So cognitive characteristics matter: they can have moral
significance. But for purposes of resource use, they don’t. Not
in my view. That’s a foundational principle of the abolitionist
approach.

NW: So, that is very different from a thinker like Peter Singer, who
presumably would allow that we could use animals in various ways, it’s
just that in the process, we should minimize the suffering we cause to
them.

GF: Yes. Peter’s view is really no different from that of
Bentham. Peter maintains that animals don’t have an interest
in continuing to live—he makes exceptions for the non-human
great apes, and perhaps for dolphins or whatnot—but he
thinks that, as a general matter, animals don’t have an interest
in continuing to live, and that they don’t care that we use
them. They only care about how we use them. He does not
think killing them is harming them per se. It’s that sort of
thinking that leads to this ‘happy’ meat movement, the
‘compassionate’ consumption movement. (Although Singer
more recently appears to think that more of the animals we
routinely exploit may have some sense of the future, he has
thus far failed to recognize that they have the kind of morally
significant interest in continued existence that he accords to
humans, non-human great apes, marine mammals, and
elephants, and that would prevent him from supporting
campaigns for ‘happy’ exploitation.)

As a matter of fact, right before I came in for the interview,
I was having a cup of tea in the college cafeteria and they had
all these ‘happy’ animal foods for sale: free-range this and
free-range that, and I wanted to have a discussion with them
and request that they take these items off the shelves. Portraying
those foods as involving significantly greater protection for
animal interests is wrong. The bottom line is, Britain treats
animals more humanely than any other place in the world, but
Britain still tortures and kills the animals it consumes for food.
Think of the difference between water boarding somebody on a
bare water board and water boarding somebody on a padded
water board. If you think that that’s really significant, I
respectfully disagree.

NW: Well, this is interesting because there’s a pragmatic question here:
an abolitionist is arguing that we should just get rid of using animals, and
arguing for that case may not be the most effective way of bringing about
a movement in that direction. So many people might say that it would be
far more effective to do this in stages. We could look for more humane
treatment of animals as a step towards a position in an ideal future where
animals aren’t used at all.

GF: We would agree, I assume, that child molestation is a
major problem. Nevertheless, nobody would suggest that we
have a campaign for humane child molestation. We think it’s
wrong, and we think we ought to take a position of abolition
with respect to it: a zero tolerance policy. The regulation of
animal exploitation is fundamentally flawed. As a practical
matter, putting aside the moral issues, it can’t work. Animals
are chattel property: they have no inherent or intrinsic value
and have only extrinsic or external value. You might have a dog
or a cat that you value, but that’s simply because that’s a piece
of property that we allow you to value as you wish. Part of
what property ownership means is that we allow you to value
your property the way you want, so if you have an automobile
and you want to take really exceptionally good care of it, we
allow you to do that. If you don’t want to take exceptionally
good care of it, that’s ok, as long as you take enough care of it
so that it gets through its inspection. The same thing occurs
with animals: they’re economic commodities, it costs money to
protect their interests, and we generally don’t protect their
interests unless we get some sort of benefit, generally eco-
nomic, from doing so. Now, if that thesis is correct, then if you
look at animal welfare reform, what you should expect to find
is that in many, if not most cases, animal welfare reform
actually makes animal use more economically efficient. Look
at, for example, the movement away from the veal crate, that’s
very much an economic matter. If you take a veal calf out of
the crate and put the veal calf into a small social unit, you
actually decrease the veterinary costs. It really doesn’t make a
whole lot of difference in the grand scheme of things, and,
frankly, in a really rational world, these reforms would occur
anyway as a matter of economic rationality. In a sense, the
modern animal movement involves animal groups working
with industry to try to identify economically inefficient
practices, but that has nothing to do with changing the status
of animals as beings that have absolutely no intrinsic or
inherent value. They’re still economic commodities. The most
humanely treated animals are subjected to treatment that
would be torture if humans were involved.

NW: Imagine a world where there was no factory farming and animals
were living in this free-range way, but were still being slaughtered. Compare
that with a world with lots of factory farming. Surely, the former would
be better than the latter?

GF: That’s really no different from asking us to imagine a
world in which children are molested, and a world in which
children are molested and also beaten. A world in which they’re
just molested is better than a world in which they’re molested
and beaten. Well, that’s a no-brainer. It’s always better to cause
less harm than more harm; but that doesn’t answer the question
about whether imposing any harm is morally justifiable. What
you’ve just shown is how profound the impact has been of these
large animal organizations, because what they’re doing is
making you think that that’s the question, that what we need to
be doing is moving away from factory farming and towards this
idyllic world of happy animals lining up to be slaughtered. First
of all, that’s never going to happen as a practical matter. Second,
it completely ignores the moral question. Is it better to torture
less than to torture more? The answer is ‘of course it is’. But
that doesn’t answer the question that matters.

NW: Now, we’ve been mostly talking about harm to animals, but
some kinds of uses of animals might not harm them in a way that causes
suffering. I’m thinking particularly of the way some people humanely use
pets. Do you object to that as well?

GF: Domestication is a problem. My partner and I live with
five rescued dogs. I absolutely love dogs: you won’t find
anyone on the planet who likes dogs, and enjoys being with
them, more than I do. But if there were two left on the planet
and it were up to me as to whether or not they reproduced so
that we could continue to have pets, the answer is absolutely
not. As much as I love our dogs and I hope they have a good
life, the bottom line is it’s a really troubling life in the sense
that they’re completely dependent on us for everything. They
live in this netherworld of vulnerability; they’re not really
animals and they’re not humans, and they’re completely
dependent on us. This strikes me as being, in certain ways, a
sad existence, and I think we ought to take care of the ones
that we have here right now, but I think that we ought to stop
bringing domesticated animals into existence altogether.

NW: There’s a further problem with pets. If you have a pet, and the
pet is a carnivore, and you’re a vegan, does that mean you have to turn
your pet into a vegan too?

GF: Our dogs are all vegans, and have been for decades, and
they do very well. The question I get asked as much as I get the
‘What about plants?’ question, is ‘What do you do about vegan
cats?’ Many cats can be vegan, but I draw the distinction
between justification and excuse. Domestication throws up a
lot of ugly dilemmas for us. I don’t think that feeding meat
to cats is morally justifiable. It may be excusable in that it is
morally problematic, but where the moral wrongness is
mitigated. What else are you going to do? I’m often asked,
‘Well, what if you’re on a desert island, and there are no
vegetables, and the only thing that you can do is eat a rabbit or
die, do you eat the rabbit?’ The answer is that if you, Nigel, and
I are on the desert island, and there are no vegetables to eat and
there are no rabbits to eat, then I might kill you and consume
you. That doesn’t mean it’s morally justifiable, but we might
say it’s excusable, in the sense that it’s the wrong thing I did,
but we understand why I did it. If I had cats that needed meat,
I would basically take the position, ‘I’m not happy about doing
this, I don’t like doing this, but this is a situation in which
I have to do something morally wrong in order to do the
right thing.’

NW: Earlier, you were talking about how some people, inconsistently in
your view, eat free-range meat, and it somehow salves their consciences. Well,
what about turning this round on you. Eating a vegan diet typically involves
suffering to animals: you may not see it, but I’ve worked in a flour mill. To
store grain involves killing rats, killing mice. There’s no easy way around
that, so it’s not as if you don’t have blood on your hands, either.

GF: My friends in the Jain community would say that,
basically, you can’t live in the material world without engaging
in conduct that is harmful to other beings. I agree with that:
you can’t. If I build a road, I know that there are going to be
deaths on that road. There’s still a difference between building
a road where I know that people are going to get killed, and
deliberately killing particular people. So if I say, ‘Look, I don’t
want to engage in violence, I don’t want to engage in killing,
so I’m not going to eat animals, and I’m going to eat plants’,
obviously, I should endeavour to farm in ways in which there
is as little harm as possible, but there will be unintended harm,
that’s inevitable.

NW: If you came across a deer that had been killed in a road, would
you be prepared to eat it? The deer is dead, it wasn’t deliberately killed, it
was an accident. If you don’t eat it, the flesh and potential protein goes to
waste. Is there anything wrong with eating it?

GF: No, I wouldn’t eat the deer any more than I would eat
hamburgers that I found thrown away in a dumpster, or
something like that. I want to get us away from the idea of
animals as things to eat, just as if I went through a dumpster
and found a nice warm human arm, I wouldn’t eat that arm
because humans are not things to eat.

NW: Why do you think so few people actually believe what you believe?
There are many people who are concerned about animals suffering, some
of those stop eating red meat, some of them stop eating all meat and all fish,
very few take the whole journey towards veganism. Why do you think that is?

GF: There are several reasons for that. I think the most
important reason is there is a whole movement out there, a
huge, multi-billion dollar industry movement called the
humane movement, or the animal movement, or the animal
rights movement, whatever you want to call it, that is telling
people they don’t need to do that. It’s very hard for them to
take the position that we ought to support campaigns for
free-range eggs, and then say people shouldn’t eat free-range
eggs, so they don’t have a vegan message. What they’re
doing is promoting this ‘compassionate consumption’ notion.
I must say that I hate that expression more than just about any
expression on the globe, ‘compassionate consumption’.
They’ve got the father of the animal rights movement, Peter
Singer, saying that if we are conscientious about eating ‘happy’
meat and other animal foods, that’s morally defensible. Well, if
the father of the animal rights movement says that, then why
should you think about veganism? But I’m here to tell you, if
you care about animals—and I really believe this—you can’t eat
them, wear them, or use them. You go vegan.
