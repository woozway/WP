Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Again

METAPHYSICS, MEANING,
AND REASON

SUSAN WOLF ON 
Meaning in Life

David Edmonds: Sisyphus was a figure in Greek mythology,
condemned by the Gods to roll a huge stone up a hill, only to watch it roll
back down again, and to repeat this process ad infinitum. Even if poor
old Sisyphus came to terms with his fate, and ended up enjoying it, his life
doesn’t sound very meaningful. This Philosophy Bite is about meaning
in life—with the eminent philosopher Susan Wolf. To say of someone that
they’re living a meaningful life, she says, it’s not enough that they’re
happy. Nor does it necessarily mean that they’re especially moral—
devoting their lives to others. Meaning is a separate category from
fulfilment or morality. To live a meaningful life requires engagement in
activities or relationships that are objectively valuable—and it’s not
valuable to spend your life in the equivalent of Sisyphean stone pushing.

Nigel Warburton: We’re going to focus on the topic of meaning in
life. What does ‘meaning in life’ mean?

Susan Wolf: It’s a dimension of a good life. We tend to think
that some people’s lives are more meaningful than others’.
Sometimes we feel that there’s something missing in our lives
and it’s not just pleasure, it’s something more difficult to get a
handle on—and ‘meaning’ is the word that comes up to try to
express that. We want something that will be more rewarding
in a special way.

NW: And is asking about the meaning in my life a question about
morality?

SW: First, I should mention that it’s not the same question
as ‘What is the meaning of my life?’ When we talk about the
meaning of life, we are often asking, ‘What’s the purpose of
life? What am I put on this earth for?’ That sounds almost like
a religious question. Asking whether my life is meaningful is
different. I am asking whether my life has something—or
more than one thing—in it that gives it a point.

I started reflecting on this subject because it occurred to me
that philosophers, and maybe everybody else, tend to think of
life in terms of two categories, and meaning doesn’t fit into
either. The two categories are, first, happiness or self-interest—
that what I want out of life is to be as happy as possible. One
dimension of a good life is for it to be happy, or go well for
oneself. Second, there’s morality or being good from an
impersonal standpoint. But it seems to me that many of the
things that we do in life, the things that really drive us, don’t fit
into either of those categories.

NW: I’d really like to hear an example of something that does give
meaning to someone’s life.

SW: There are two kinds of examples: they’re familiar
things around which people structure their lives. One kind has
to do with personal relationships, and another with non-
personal activities that play a central or deep role in your life,
like a vocation or a political or social cause that you’re
committed to.

Let’s start with an example of doing something for your
child, making an elaborate Halloween costume for her. I can
remember spending hours, and actually losing tremendous
hours of sleep, trying to get the costume just right for my
daughter’s Halloween parade the next day. And I remember
thinking, I’m not doing this because it’s in my self-interest—
it’s not making me happy, and if I had more hours to sleep, I
would be better off. On the other hand, I’m certainly not
doing it because it’s better for the world or because I have a
moral duty to make an elaborate Halloween costume. I’m
doing it for my daughter. But, having this relationship with my
daughter, loving my daughter, doing things out of love for her,
that’s one of the things that gives meaning to my life.

Another kind of example is writing a philosophy article, and
working very hard on it. Suppose I’ve written two drafts but I
keep struggling to make it better. This can be painstaking and it
can make you nauseous, and again you can lose sleep over it. If
you’ve got tenure, not many people are going to notice the
difference in the quality of the work and I’m not sure that I’m
better off by making it that little bit better. Certainly, the world
doesn’t care that much, and I could do much more good if I
were raising money for Oxfam, or whatever. But I’m doing it to
get it right; I’m doing it because of an attachment to philosophy
and the values of good, clear writing and the quest for truth.

NW: So is that a subjective value for you or are you suggesting that
there is an objective value in the relationship of a mother to her child or of
a philosopher to her article?

SW: Well, in my view, it’s essential to meaningfulness that it
has both of those things and that they’re appropriately linked.
The idea of meaning is the idea of doing something that
you’re subjectively very attracted to, engaged by, excited by,
but the thing to which you’re devoting all this energy and
attention is also objectively valuable. If I didn’t love
philosophy then it wouldn’t give meaning to my life to keep
banging my head against the wall to write a better article. On
the other hand, if what I loved was not philosophy but
Sudoku, and I was just spending hours on end trying to solve
an ultra-hard Sudoku, that wouldn’t be objectively valuable,
and so that also wouldn’t give meaning to my life.

NW: But what makes philosophy better than Sudoku? A critic might
say that philosophy is just like Sudoku—solving little problems and a good
way of passing the time. But beyond that there’s nothing objectively
valuable about philosophy.

SW: Actually, that’s a good question. There’s a worry that
there’s nothing objectively valuable about philosophy. It’s
easier to say why Sudoku isn’t valuable than why philosophy
is. Sudoku is not doing anything good for anyone else and it’s
not creative. Obviously, in answering your question in this way
I’m showing that I don’t have a theory of objective value in
which everything with objective value has property X and
Sudoku doesn’t have this property. I’m starting from our
communal intuitions about what’s valuable and what isn’t. We
recognize a lot of things as valuable, and I’m guessing that
we’re on the right track with that. Then I Iook at Sudoku and
say, ‘This has none of it.’ This is based on personal experience,
of course, having wasted a lot of time doing Sudokus myself.

NW: So in answering the question, ‘What will make life meaningful?’,
you’re not telling people the actual ingredients—but you’re providing a
structure. You’re saying it’s going to be subjectively pleasurable, you will
be personally committed to it, and it is going to have objective value.
‘Meaning’ is going to take that form.

SW: Yes, that’s right. One way to look at the issue is against
the background of what, in the US, is a very familiar view
about meaning—find your passion and go for it. So when
people ask how to live a meaningful life, the answer is not to
go for conventional success, but to look for something you’re
passionate about and engage in that, and that will make your
life meaningful. My view is that there’s something right about
that, but it’s not enough. Because if your passion is for
Sudokus, or for rolling a stone up a hill, it doesn’t seem to me
to be sufficient to be meaningful. So really, the advice, which
is very limited, is to find your passion, but before you
go for it, stop and think—is there anything worthwhile about
spending my life engaged in this activity or promoting
this goal?

NW: And your notion of what’s worthwhile is far beyond morality; it
doesn’t have to be altruistic, good for other people—there can be other
worthwhile values, such as aesthetic values, which might not be good for
anyone else?

SW: Right. Moral values are among the really valuable
things that you can have and for a lot of people the projects
that give their lives most meaning are moral ones. There’s a
moral component to advancing political causes, assisting
people, and, of course, in relationships with loved ones—these
give a lot of meaning to our lives and they involve helping
people other than ourselves. But in addition to that, there’s
creating works of beauty, advancing knowledge—scientific
and philosophical inquiry—and maybe even the pursuit of
excellence in any number of ways. Being an Olympic athlete is
a meaningful activity, even though it doesn’t contribute to any
moral good in any particular way.

NW: That example of athletics is an interesting one because some
people see no point in just being the fastest runner, and some people
disparage kicking a football around—why kick a bit of leather or plastic
around a field? You might do it really well, they say, but it doesn’t have a
significance in the universe.

SW: You’re right. The meaning that I tend to see in those
activities doesn’t come from the fact that you are running a
race or putting the ball in the hole or whatever, but instead
from two other kinds of things. One is doing something as
well as you can, and especially if you do it as well as you can
and it’s very well indeed. This does involve the exercise of
virtues of various kinds, like discipline. Additionally, there are
various social aspects that go with being part of a team or
being part of a community of people; so it’s not the
particular game or the particular movements that are
valuable, but the meaning of the whole activity or the realm
of interest which plugs you in to other kinds of relationships
that are valuable.

NW: Does luck play a part in whether your life is meaningful or not?

SW: Certainly, you are dependent on a certain amount of
good fortune in order for your life to be meaningful, or at least
in settling how meaningful life is. One example is a scientist
who is spending his time trying to discover something that
will cure a disease. Imagine that just before he comes out with
the discovery, someone else working in an independent
laboratory produces the cure, so that all of that work was in
some sense wasted. Had he been the person who discovered
the cure, his life would have been tremendously meaningful,
but instead there’s a sense in which it was all a waste of time.
For sure, I think his life is less meaningful than it would have
been, because of this misfortune.

NW: And is meaningfulness a social phenomenon or could a recluse
achieve meaning in his or her life?

SW: A recluse could do something that then goes off to
other people and helps them anyway; that’s one way which it
could indirectly have a social impact. There’s also the
possibility of someone who writes great poetry but the poetry
is lost or destroyed, perhaps even destroyed by the poet
himself—was his life still meaningful if no one could
appreciate his poetry? I would say it was; the production of
something beautiful is itself a valuable activity and a valuable
accomplishment.

NW: We have the real-life case of Gerard Manley Hopkins who asked
for his unpublished poems to be destroyed after his death, and his executor
didn’t do that. Now, in one scenario, he’s written the poems and they’re
wonderful poems but nobody gets to read them. In the other one, he
becomes a major figure in the history of poetry.

SW: Well, on one level, I would think that what he
accomplished was much greater as a result of people having
actually been able to benefit from reading the poetry; so
there’s some sense in which you could say there’s more
meaning to his life in this case.

NW: Those seeking meaning in their lives obviously want some
meaning: but does that mean that there are people alive who have no
meaning in their life?

SW: Well, I know it sounds harsh but, yes, I think it does.
On the one hand, there are people whose lives are just very
hard—they face so many obstacles, they have to work so hard
in order to feed themselves and their family. From a certain
point of view, it’s a luxury to be able to live a meaningful life,
and so there are people who are deprived of the opportunity.
And then there are the people who actually have the
opportunity but spend their lives doing the equivalent of
Sudokus or rolling a rock up a hill, who are wasting the
chance to do something valuable. Their lives would have very
little meaning also.

NW: John Stuart Mill said something like the best way to achieve
happiness is by not pursuing it too aggressively, and by pursuing
something else that matters to you. Is it the same with meaning in life; do
you somehow scupper your chances of having meaning in your life by
obsessing about it too much?

SW: Absolutely. From a philosophical point of view, it’s
good to remember that meaning is a dimension of the good
life, so that when we’re writing about how to live, we don’t
forget that whole realm. But when it actually comes to living,
it would be a terrible mistake to be concerned whether this or
that was adding meaning to your life—because it certainly
won’t if you have that too much in your mind.
