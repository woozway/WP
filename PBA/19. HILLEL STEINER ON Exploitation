Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Again

POLITICS

HILLEL STEINER ON 
Exploitation

David Edmonds: It’s time we at Philosophy Bites confess our guilty
little secret: we don’t pay Philosophy Bites contributors the minimum
wage. In fact, we don’t pay them anything at all. Are we thereby exploiting
them? It’s often said that desperately poor people who sell their organs for
money, or women who sell sexual services, or workers who work long
hours for next-to-no remuneration are exploited. But if they’ve entered
these agreements voluntarily, how can it be exploitation? Presumably the
low-paid worker believes that some work, however low paid, is better than
no work. In exchange for a disquisition on exploitation, we offered Hillel
Steiner a glass of water.

Nigel Warburton: What is exploitation?

Hillel Steiner: Well, the most general definition is this: it’s
an exchange of two things, goods or services, of unequal
value. And I should add this: it’s a voluntary exchange of two
things of unequal value.

NW: Could you give an example?

HS: Workers in the Third World, who work for multinational
food or clothing manufacturers, are generally regarded as
exploited when they receive low wages compared to the high
value of the products they produce. When you subtract the
value of other factor inputs from those products’ value, the
amount by which that remainder exceeds those wages
strongly suggests the presence of exploitation.

NW: So somebody making a very expensive piece of computer
equipment in terrible conditions, paid a pittance, would be a classic case
of somebody being exploited?

HS: Probably. I would want to look at more than just the
working conditions and the wages to establish whether
they’ve been exploited. It isn’t necessarily the case, on my
view of exploitation, that they’re exploited. But it’s very
likely that, when we look into the other background
circumstances that I’m alluding to, we would find that
there’s exploitation.

NW: Where does exploitation sit in relation to other kinds of
transactions that we engage in?

HS: That’s a good question and a good way of depicting
what’s so puzzling about exploitation. Transactions are
interactions between two or more people—let’s simplify by
saying just two—where there are goods or services travelling
from one to the other, and possibly also from the other to the
first. It’s useful here to think of a spectrum of transactions, at
one end of which is gifting, and at the opposite end is robbing
or theft. Somewhere in the middle is what I would call a fair
exchange. In the case of a gift, and in the case of a robbery,
there are goods or services travelling in only one direction,
from one person to the other—there’s no reciprocation. In
the middle, in fair exchange, there are goods and services
travelling in both directions, and the things exchanged are of
equal value, and are exchanged voluntarily.

Somewhere between a fair exchange and a gift is
something called a benefit. This is where, for instance, I do
a week’s work for a charity. It’s not completely a gift because
at the end of the week, they give me a perfectly ordinary
ballpoint pen, just as a token of their appreciation. Now in
this case, we’ve each exchanged, voluntarily, but the two
things exchanged are not of equal value, and indeed it would
not serve the purpose of that exchange if they were of equal
value. Nonetheless, there are things travelling in both
directions in a benefit.

Exploitation is the symmetrical counterpart to a benefit. It
lies on the spectrum between the fair exchange in the middle,
and the theft or robbery at the end.

NW: Just to get this clear, let’s take an example: suppose I’ve got a rare
book, a first edition of Karl Marx’s Das Kapital, and somebody steals it
from me. That’s bad: that’s on one end of the spectrum. At the other end
of the spectrum, I could give it to somebody—for nothing. And in between
we have a fair exchange: perhaps I sell it at auction and receive a decent
amount of money for it. And then there’s exploitation, where somebody
offers me very little money for it, but I voluntarily enter into that
transaction.

HS: That’s exactly right. And the question is why? Why
would you do that, rather than try to secure the greater
amount of money that’s involved in a fair exchange. You’re
presumably not trying to confer a benefit, you’re not being
altruistic: rather, you’re acting in a purely self-interested
way—as is the person who’s paying this paltry price. So why
are you accepting such a paltry price? And the obvious answer
is because that’s the best you can get. Its being the best you
can get and its being, in your view, paltry, doesn’t mean that
this is necessarily an instance of exploitation. We need more
background facts to the case before we can say for certain that
this is an instance of exploitation.

NW: Well, one obvious fact we’d need, I assume, is the real value of
that book. Some people would say the real value is just whatever price you
can get for it on that day.

HS: That is what some people would say, and that’s why
there are many enthusiasts of the free market who insist that
it’s impossible for exploitation to occur in the free market
because every transaction is voluntary and, ipso facto, it’s fair.
I like the theory of value that these people use—I agree with
the claim that the highest price that someone would offer is
the correct measure of the value of something. I don’t believe
things have an intrinsic value of their own. But I want to add a
qualification that free market enthusiasts don’t always trouble
to add. I want to say that the value of something is the highest
amount of money that someone would bid at an auction for,
say, your Karl Marx book, provided there were no relevant
injustice, no rights violation, in the background . . . in other
words, what price the book would fetch at a fair auction.

NW: What if somebody were prepared to pay a billion dollars for my
Karl Marx book—would that really be the correct price?

HS: Why do you think it wouldn’t be?

NW: Well, it would seem that this somebody was just being crazy,
sentimental perhaps, because they could have got it for a fraction of
the price.

HS: I dare say a vast number of the things we buy are driven
by our sentiments: certainly, they’re not all driven by biological
need. If—and here’s the big IF—if this person came by his
wealth, by his resources justly, and if his sentiments for having
a copy of Das Kapital were that strong, I can’t see any way of
gainsaying his valuation of that book.

NW: You mentioned the sense of there being a rights violation
somewhere along the line in the transaction. Could you expand on that?

HS: Yes, this lies at the core of the theory. Think again about
the auction; competitive markets are supposed to be auctions
writ large. Suppose that somebody buys your Karl Marx book
for £20, but it could have sold for £30. However, the guy who
was ready to bid £30 was barred at the door from coming into
the auction. Now, his being barred at the door isn’t necessarily
a violation of his rights—we’d have to go into some complex
issues to know whether it was or not—but let’s suppose it was
a violation of his rights. Then, by virtue of his rights having
been violated, you have lost £10 on your Karl Marx book sale.
That’s a standard way in which a rights violation provides a
necessary condition for an exploitation.

NW: Would there be a parallel in the job marketplace? What would be
the equivalent in terms of somebody being exploited by an employer?

HS: Exploitation might result in a number of ways. For
example, a parallel of the case we’ve just had with the book
and the auction might arise if there are restrictions on the
sorts of employer who can bid for that person’s labour—for
example, if certain people are not licensed to be employers, or
if there are various other restrictions on who can bid for that
labour—which will lead to some lower than otherwise
winning bid and thus result in an exploitation. Such restric-
tions are violations of the right of free association.

That’s the standard model of exploitation that I developed
about 30 years ago. Since then, I’ve realized that there is
another way in which, effectively, the same thing could
happen: another way in which a rights violation sets up the
condition for an exploitation. Suppose a person has been made
poorer unjustly: suppose he has been made poorer, not by
gambling his money away at a casino, but by being unjustly
robbed. Suppose, had he not been made poorer in this way, he
would not have accepted a wage of less than £30 a day, but
because he has been made poorer, he accepts less than this.
I would say that whoever employs him for, say, £20 a day, is
exploiting him. That employer is getting him for less than in a
just world—in a world in which his rights hadn’t been
violated—he would have received.

NW: We’ve been talking as if whether someone’s exploited or not
is a black-and-white issue—either you’re exploited or you’re not.
But surely, what really matters is the degree to which you are exploited.
If somebody exploits me, and I lose 5p a day, that’s not a serious case
of exploitation. If I lose £500 a day, for me, that would be pretty
serious.

HS: That’s absolutely right. Indeed, the whole idea of this
particular model of exploitation is to be able to get precise
about numbers; how much would have been bid for your
product or labour or whatever you’re selling if that prior
injustice, that rights violation, hadn’t occurred. And if 5p is
how much more would have been bid, in the context of this
society it’s fairly negligible. So, yes, there are certainly degrees
of exploitation.

NW: And does your theory suggest that a very rich person could be
exploited as well?

HS: Yes. In principle, a rich person could sell something—a
work of art or a Karl Marx volume, possibly even his daily
labour—and get a lower price than would have been the case if
a higher bidder had not been excluded from the auction or the
market. Being exploited, on my model, is possible wherever
there is a differential between the highest actual bid and the
highest counterfactual bid that would have been made if a rights
violation hadn’t previously occurred. But we would certainly
be less troubled—morally and in other ways—by a millionaire
being exploited than somebody below the poverty line.

NW: In which case, what makes something a really serious example of
exploitation—because it sounds like it’s not enough that it’s exploitation
per se?

HS: I’m assuming that exploitation is intrinsically linked to
the idea of injustice—that seems to be its natural home. But
if we think about values other than justice—such as benevo-
lence or need-alleviation—we can quite quickly explain why
it is that the exploitation of an impoverished worker is far
worse than the exploitation of a millionaire, even though the
actual amount by which the millionaire has been exploited
may be many times larger than the amount the worker has
been exploited. To use a good Marxist term, the ‘surplus
value’ extracted from the millionaire may be much bigger
than the surplus value extracted from the impoverished
worker.

NW: Some people think that there are areas of human transaction
which are essentially exploitative: that is, there can be no fair price, for
example, for a bodily organ, or for your body, when this is sold for sexual
purposes. Is that what you believe?

HS: No, it isn’t what I believe. I’m not sure whether my
model of exploitation, as we’ve been exploring it, precludes
the idea that transactions for some kinds of goods or services
are necessarily exploitative. But I wouldn’t say so. When it
comes to peoples’ bodies and their parts thereof, I think it
would be unjust to stop them from selling their body parts if
that’s what they want to do.

NW: Does it follow then that there is a fair price for everything? If
I wanted to sell myself as a meal, for instance, to a cannibal, that’s my
right, and as long as the cannibal pays the going rate, then I can serve
myself up?

HS: I think there’s nothing unjust about your doing that.
There may be lots of other grounds on which it might be a
morally wrong thing to do, but I don’t think it’s unjust, and
I do think it would be unjust to stop you.

NW: We’ve been discussing this at an abstract level. Does it have any
real-life implications? If we believe your account of exploitation, should
we change the way we structure human interactions?

HS: I think so. One thing my account shows is that a
perfectly voluntary exchange, such as the free market
ostensibly sponsors, can, contrary to many of its enthusiasts,
be exploitative, and therefore unjust. This is definitely not an
argument against free markets. On the whole, I think free
markets are good things, and very efficient for a number of
very well-known reasons. Rather, what this argument supplies
is a reason for looking at what economists call the endowments
that people bring to the market—their goods, services, and
money—and seeing whether these endowments—in par-
ticular, their magnitudes—are what they are for many people
because of some prior injustice, perhaps repeatedly com-
pounded prior injustices that go back a long time and for
many generations. When people who are poor—not because
of their own doings, irresponsible gambling say, but because
they have, in one way or another, been robbed, or previously
exploited—come to the market, the price that they get for
what they are selling is very likely to be exploitative. The
structural change I’m indicating is, then, not a curtailment of
free markets but rather a redistribution of wealth consistent
with the requirements of justice.

NW: Have you ever been exploited?

HS: Gosh, I don’t think so. I haven’t felt exploited.

NW: At least you’re not saying we’re exploiting you. Hillel Steiner,
thanks very much.
