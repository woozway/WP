Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Again

JOY AND PAIN

NOËL CARROLL ON
Humour

David Edmonds: A man and his friend are out for their weekly game of
golf when a funeral procession crosses the road next to the course. The man
stops in mid-swing, takes off his golf cap, and bows down to pray. ‘Wow’,
says his friend, ‘that’s thoughtful. How touching!’ ‘Well’, says the man,
‘we were married for thirty-five years.’ That, according to one survey, is
what Americans think is the world’s funniest joke. But what makes
something humorous? Do all jokes share one or more characteristics? And
can a joke be so sick that it ceases to be funny? Nigel Warburton plays
straight man to Noēl Carroll of the City University, New York.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we’re going to focus on today is humour.
What is humour?

Noël Caroll: Humour is what causes us to be comically
amused. For example, let me tell you a joke. An Irishman
named Pat goes into a bar in New York City. He goes in and he
orders three shots of Jameson. ‘Set them up, right away, three
of them!’ The bartender sets them up. Pat orders three more.
Three more. Three more. Finally, the bartender says ‘Why do
you always order your drinks in groups of three?’ He says,
‘Well, I have two brothers: one’s in Sydney, one’s in Dublin,
and I like to make believe we’re all drinking together.’ Well,
Pat becomes a regular. As soon as he comes through the door,
the bartender sets up three shots. One day, Pat comes up to
the bar and says, ‘No. Today, just two.’ The bartender looks
and says, ‘Oh, I’m sorry to hear of your loss.’ Pat says, ‘What
loss?’ He says, ‘Well, you’re only ordering two drinks, did one
of your brothers pass away?’ He says, ‘No, it’s me. Don’t you
know I’m on the wagon?’

NW: (Laughs) That’s an example of comic amusement; I’m amused by
that.

NC: That’s exactly right. Now we can go on from that to
talk about what it is.

NW: So what is it?

NC: Well, philosophers have been interested in it for quite
a long time. One view, apparently the most ancient, is called
the superiority view, first advanced by people like Plato and
Aristotle. It’s the view that when we laugh, we laugh at
someone who is inferior to us. Plato might have said, we
laugh at people who don’t respect the Delphic adage of
knowing thyself—the people who think they’re smart or
handsome or stronger or better athletes than they actually
are. Hobbes, of course, was the most famous proponent
of this. He said laughter is the sudden glory we feel when
another in comparison to us seems less than us, when
we seem better than they are. So the first view of comic
amusement is that it’s a form of contempt. That view held
a great deal of sway until about the eighteenth century,
when the Scottish philosopher Francis Hutcheson and then
someone he influenced, another Scot, James Beattie, in the
Scottish Enlightenment, argued against it. They said, ‘Look,
it couldn’t possibly be that superiority is the source of comic
amusement. For example, consider this: oysters are inferior
but we never laugh at them.’ So, what philosophers and
psychologists, including myself, now think is a better bet is what
we call an incongruity theory. The source of comic amusement
is the perception of something that seems incongruous. For
example, if you’re walking down the street and you see a
Morris Minor parked next to a stretch Hummer, you might
think that that’s really humorous. And, of course, jokes like the
one I just told about Pat involve an incongruity, namely, that Pat
thinks that being on the wagon is consistent with having only
two drinks, as long as he’s not drinking for himself.

NW: So, laughing at somebody according to the superiority view
involves the opinion that somehow I’m better than that. It seems to me
that that does occur. It’s not that it never occurs. We do laugh at people
who are inferior to us: it may sound nasty, but we do.

NC: It’s not the case that one wants to dismiss the
superiority theory across the board. But very often these
superiority genres really depend more on incongruity: that’s
what’s doing the work. So, there are British jokes against the
Irish; French jokes about the Belgians; Belgian jokes against
the French; Indian jokes about Sikhs; American jokes about
Poles, and so on. These jokes take a very definite pattern,
and they almost all involve incongruity. Really, they’re all
‘moron’ jokes. How can you tell an Irishman has been using
your personal computer? There’s white-out on the screen.
I could also tell that as a Polish joke. I originally heard it as
a ‘Newfie’ joke. Newfie jokes are jokes about people from
Newfoundland in Canada. Now, if there’s some particular
group that you’d like to put down, you can use the moron
structure to do it, mocking a character who commits logical
and other errors of stupendous sorts.

NW: Now it seems obvious to me that not all incongruity is funny.
There must be plenty of examples of things that are incongruous but that
aren’t funny at all.

NC: That’s a terrific point. Alexander Bain raised it in the
nineteenth century. Even if incongruity, or perceived incongruity,
is necessary for humour, it’s not sufficient because, as you say,
there are all of these kinds of incongruities that are anything
but amusing. So, when you try to revise an incongruity
theory for the present, what you’ve got to do is put in some
qualifications. The first one is that the incongruity shouldn’t
involve the production of any sort of anxiety. For example,
psychologists have noted that, with infants, a caregiver—a
mother, or an uncle, or someone with whom the infant is
acquainted—can make a strange face and the baby will giggle;
but if a stranger does the same thing, the baby will wail. The
point is that there has to be a certain safety. Aristotle even
talked about this: he said there can’t be real destruction
involved in comedy.

NW: Does that mean that you can’t have ‘edgy’ humour, the kind where
a comedian deliberately goes a little bit too far and puts the audience under
a kind of pressure?

NC: There are several devices that really are going to permit
you to introduce a certain degree of what may appear
anxiety producing, but this is buffered in very important ways.
Take the clown figure: clowns are really not like us. They’re
not really quite human: they’re either too fat or too skinny.
But they’re also able to do things like be hit on the head with
a brick and then, in a matter of seconds, be standing up and
able to behave normally. So one thing you do is to reassure
the audience that the figures are not really being hurt, as in
slapstick comedy. Then, of course, the other feature that is
very important here is that we have all kinds of conventions
to signal that we’re going to enter a zone in which people
shouldn’t be worried or anxious about what’s going to
happen. Either I say to you, ‘Did you hear the one about . . .?’,
or maybe I change my intonation, or maybe I just wink at
you. All of those features allow the humour to absorb a
certain amount of the anxiety that you might otherwise feel.
You need those buffers.

NW: There are some people who find violence funny. That’s the sad
truth. Are they just inappropriate?

NC: That raises the whole question of black humour. My
own view of black humour, though, is that the reason that
we’re amused by, for example, dead baby jokes like, ‘What is
brown and gurgles?’ ‘A baby casserole’, is that in jokes like that
it’s not the baby that we’re laughing at: we’re laughing at the
people we think will become apoplectic upon hearing it.
Remember that black humour was inaugurated by André
Breton, who thought of black humour as the enemy of
sentimentality. He thought of it as another way of outraging
the bourgeoisie. So, black humour—to a certain extent—is
about directing us to think about how our puritanical and
sanctimonious neighbours will respond. A friend of mine likes
to say: black humour is doing something that would drive
your mother crazy.

NW: So we’ve talked about one aspect of humour, according to the
incongruity theory, namely that the relevant events aren’t anxiety producing.
Are there any other aspects of incongruity that are important in under-
standing humour?

NC: Well, another qualification we need on the relevant kind
of incongruity is that the incongruity not be the sort that
provokes, what we might call, a genuine problem-solving
attitude. So, there are lots of incongruities that take the form
of puzzles and that motivate us to solve the puzzle: crossword
puzzles, chess problems, mathematical theorems, for example.
These, though, are very different from what we encounter
with the incongruity relevant to humour. Here’s a typical
two-stage joke: Aaron calls his friend Moshe on his cell phone;
Moshe is driving and Aaron says, ‘Be careful. The radio says
there’s a nut who’s driving the wrong way on the highway.’
And Moshe says, ‘You’re telling me! There are hundreds of
them!’ Now, as in most jokes, the punch line is a kind of puzzle
that calls for a solution. The solution to this is that Moshe is the
‘nut’ who’s driving the wrong way on the highway. But, of
course, there’s something very strange about these interpret-
ations we use to solve the puzzles in jokes: that is, they’re as
absurd as the punchlines themselves. It’s absurd to think that
someone could be on a crowded highway and not know that
he was driving in the wrong direction. Now, that contrasts with
what I call genuine problem solving, where you expect to be
correct; you’re genuinely trying to solve a puzzle.

NW: Several of the examples you’ve used could be considered quite
offensive, particularly the ‘moron’ jokes, which deliberately demean a
particular group of people. Do you think there is anything about an
immoral joke that stops it being funny?

NC: There are two dimensions here. One is morality:
there’s no question that a joke could be immoral or that it
could be told for immoral reasons. Someone might tell an
anti-Semitic joke in order to stoke anti-Semitism. On the other
hand, comic structures have a kind of formal interest. Not
every anti-Semitic joke need be told for anti-Semitic reasons.
Most of the kinds of jokes that outsiders tell about Jewish
people are exactly the same as the jokes that insiders tell. That
is also the case with African-Americans. The jokes that are
told with invective against them are the same types that
insiders tell. There are jokes that are told with harmful intent;
there it may, in fact, be the case that the joke is both immoral
and funny. To face your question head-on: are there cases
where some jokes are so immoral that they become unfunny?
I think it’s a possibility. Some theorists like Ted Cohen think,
‘No, you just have to accept as a fact of the sadness of human
life that sometimes very very horrid examples of humour are
simultaneously funny.’ I would—to a certain extent—agree
with that, but I wouldn’t go as far as he does, which is to say
that the funniness of a joke could never be upended, so to
speak, by its immorality.

NW: So, in a sense, the logical structure of incongruity that you’ve
talked about isn’t the only factor that makes something funny. There’s a
sense in which some content would just put a shutter down and that’s it.
Despite having the correct form, it’s not going to be funny.

NC: That’s the direction I lean in, yes.

NW: Something behind this which has been intriguing me is why we
have a sense of humour at all? Why have human beings developed with a
sense of humour?

NC: One thing that humour depends on is that we think in
terms of certain heuristics, certain norms. Those heuristics
work pretty well, but they also—because they’re very fast ways
of scoping out situations—have a lot of imperfections. Here’s
an example; it’s a Chinese story. A man sees another man
walking along the road in front of his horse. And he goes up to
the man who’s walking in front of his horse and he says, ‘Why
are you walking in front of the horse? Why don’t you get on?
The horse would get to Beijing much faster!’ The man says, ‘Ah,
yes. But six legs are faster than four.’ So, that heuristic works
most of the time, probably, but not this time. Or, to come to
our own culture: a somewhat heavy man goes into a pizza
parlour and orders a pie. The man behind the counter says, ‘Do
you want it cut into eight slices or four?’ He thinks for a second
and says, ‘Well, four. I’m on a diet.’ So in those cases, we see
how the heuristics that we usually use can go wrong in certain
situations. A lot of humour is about showing us how our
heuristics can go wrong, reminding us how the many heuristics
we have have holes in them. We’ve been rewarded by evolution
to take pleasure in discovering these bugs in our cognitive
functioning, and it serves the vital purpose of our cognitive
wellbeing. It’s not, as the superiority theorists thought, a way
of celebrating our superiority; it’s not about arrogance.
Humour is about humility: realizing what cognitively frail
beings we are.
