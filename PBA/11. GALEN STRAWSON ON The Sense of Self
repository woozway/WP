Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Again

MIND, SELF, AND
IMAGINATION

GALEN STRAWSON ON 
The Sense of Self

David Edmonds: ‘Know thyself ’ was a popular aphorism with the
ancients, but it isn’t that clear what this means. What is the self? Is it
fixed? And should we spend our lives trying to uncover its nature? Is that
being true to oneself? Or is the self, as the existentialists believe, some-
thing we create and revise as we go along? And what is the link between
the self and character? The one and only Galen Strawson has grappled
with these questions, though he lacks—he says—any strong sense of his
own self.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we’re going to talk about is the sense of
the self. In your philosophical study of this, what have you discovered?
What do people say about their sense of the self?

Galen Strawson: Well, one of the most striking things is
that people are so different in this respect. Some people think
they have a very clear, qualitatively detailed, sense of their
own unique personality; whereas others feel that they don’t
really find anything when they look inside and try to form a
sense of what they’re like.

NW: Could you give examples?

GS: On the positive side, Gerald Manley Hopkins is one
of the best examples. He talks of ‘. . . my self-being, my
consciousness and feeling of myself, that taste of myself, of I
and me above and in all things which is more distinctive than
the taste of ale or alum, more distinctive than the smell of
walnut-leaf or camphor, and is incommunicable by any means
to another man’. Well, that’s Hopkins describing something
that leaves me completely bewildered. I have no idea what he’s
talking about. I’m more on the side of Iris Murdoch. Here is
Iris Murdoch, reported by her husband John Bayley: ‘Iris
once told me that the question of identity had always puzzled
her. She thought she herself hardly possessed such a thing,
whatever it was. I said that she must know what it’s like to be
oneself, even to revel in the consciousness of oneself as a
secret and separate person. She smiled; looked amused,
uncomprehending.’

NW: Does that carry across to our knowledge of other people? I might
have a sense of what other people are like, even if I’m a bit vague about
what I’m like.

GS: I think we have a very strong intuitive sense of the
personality of others; it’s just that we don’t necessarily have
that for ourselves. Ian McEwan talks about the ‘glassy
continuum of self hood’, by which he means the invisibility
of your own character to yourself. And Jean-Paul Sartre puts it
like this: ‘Character has no distinct existence, except as an
object of knowledge to other people. Consciousness does not
know its own character.’

NW: You’ve mentioned character there. Is character part of what we
are as selves? Is that what your sense of self might come from, the sense
of what kind of a character you are?

GS: Yes, I think it would for those who have a strong sense
of self. But imagine that you are wearing pink spectacles
through which you view the world, and you just assume the
world is pink—it doesn’t occur to you that you’re wearing
spectacles. I think your own character is a bit like that. It’s
something you see the world through, and so it doesn’t really
feature as an object of experience for you. It just conditions
everything and it’s invisible to you.

NW: And yet people around you are likely to make all kinds of
attributions about your character and believe that you’re an angry person,
or that you’re a kind person, or whatever.

GS: Yes. And if I were set the task, I’m sure I could come up
with some fairly reasonable description of what kind of
person I am, but it’s just that it’s invisible to me as I live
my life.

NW: But also, I suppose—if you feel that way—if other people are
telling you you’re one kind of a person, you’ve got no criteria for judging
whether they’re right or not if you can’t find, within yourself, the thing
that matches up with their description of you.

GS: Well, I could almost go ‘behaviourist’ about myself
at this point. I’ve got the data about the things I’ve done
and I know that people have said ‘well that must show that
you had a bad temper’ and so on. But you’re quite right.
There’s something odd here in the fact that I don’t seem to
find my character as given in any way from the inside. So I
have to, as it were, think about my life, and think about what
I’ve been doing, to see why they might categorize me like that.

NW: Well, that would fit with the idea that the self is somehow
socially constructed, that it isn’t anything within me, as well as with a
behaviourist account as you suggested.

GS: I suppose that it would fit with that, but I would want to
resist that. I think there are facts about character that are
wholly independent of whatever people mean by ‘social
construction’. It may be that a lot of your character traits only
emerge in interaction with others, but I don’t think that means
that they’re socially constructed in the sense that they’re not
real independently of that. I’d take quite a strong genetic line
here—there’s a lot of genetic determination in character. If
you add early experience on to that, most of it is in place. If
you say ‘it’s socially constructed’, I don’t think that means it’s
in some way less than fully objective.

NW: Now, this seems to me a bit different from what David Hume was
seeking when he famously looked within himself and couldn’t find a
self—an enduring self. Other people had told him that it must be there, as
the soul, something that stays there throughout life, and possibly even
beyond that. He looked for experience to back this up and all he could find
were fleeting impressions; there was nothing that remained fixed.

GS: I’m trying to write a book about what Hume said on
the self because, as usual, I think that people have misreported
him. It’s certainly true that he said you didn’t find any
enduring self, but he was just applying his empiricism
rigorously in asking ‘What are the actual data?’, and answering
‘What we find when we “enter intimately into ourselves” and
think about our mental life, is just one experience after
another.’ One big mistake that people make is to think that
Hume is saying that there isn’t a subject of experience at all,
even in the moment. He’s certainly not saying that. He does,
of course, think that every one of these fleeting experiences
has a subject. There has to be someone there who’s experien-
cing it. So, that’s the big mistake people make about Hume—
to think that he’s saying that there isn’t really any kind of
subject at all. In fact, as you put it, what he’s saying is that you
just don’t find an enduring self. There may indeed be one, but
you just haven’t got the evidence, and so you’ve got no right
to assert that there is.

NW: So what you’re saying is that Hume’s introspection doesn’t reveal
an impression of an enduring self, as he would put it. There’s no sensory
or experiential input that tells me there’s something there, but that doesn’t
mean that there isn’t something there.

GS: Yes, that’s right. But I certainly want to put the stress
back on enduring. The chapter opens with him saying, ‘Look,
all these philosophers around us are absolutely sure that
they have this direct, intuitive, instinctive knowledge of the
existence of the eternal soul.’ That’s what he’s really trying
to attack. These people think that they have direct experience
of having an enduring immaterial soul. But he’s saying,
‘Where are the data? The evidence simply isn’t there.’ And
he’s right.

NW: But that seems to me different from character, which is what we
were discussing earlier in relation to the self. Hume’s not looking in this
famous passage for an enduring character—because in his autobiograph-
ical sketch ‘My Own Life’, he describes his character in slightly
self-aggrandizing ways. There’s a sense in which he recognizes, or at least
believes he recognizes, his own character traits.

GS: Yes, that’s completely right. We really have got two
different topics here. On the one hand, you’ve got the self, and
whether it exists, and whether it’s a thing that endures; and on
the other hand, you have got all these issues to do with
character. You’re quite right that Hume is not concerned with
character in his initial discussion of personal identity, but he’s
certainly not denying that human beings have characters.
There are good ones and bad ones and kind ones and mean
ones.

NW: So what’s the relationship between the self, the kind of thing
that Hume was looking for, and character?

GS: That’s tricky. In my work, I’ve tried to split these two
topics up. In Selves, the book that I’ve just published, I’m
writing about whether there is such a thing as the self—meta-
physically speaking.5 The sequel to this book—I’m planning to
call it Life in Time—is going to be much more about character.
The basic difference that I want to consider is the difference
between those people who naturally think of themselves as
things that were there in the past and will be there in the
future, and those people—I include myself as one of them—
who have very little sense of its being them who was there in
the further past or who will be there in the further future.
What you find is that there’s this massive consensus in the
humanities, today, about the importance of narrative. This is
not only in philosophy and literature, it goes even into
medicine and law, and it’s very important in psychotherapy. It
seems to be almost orthodoxy, now, for therapists to say, ‘Well,
what we’ve got to do to help this person is to let them develop
a narrative of their lives and let them make sense of their lives
in that way.’ But it seems to me that, while this may work for
some people, it’s just not the right thing to try to do for
others—others like myself. There’s variety. We have to stand
up for variety in human life: deep difference. There are some
people who are not narrative in their outlook, who are just
happy-go-lucky, living in the moment, and this is not a worse
way of life.

NW: Internal narrative is about the level of consciousness that we
have of ourselves, yet it seems that neuroscience and psychology
are converging more and more on the idea that much of what we are
is either inaccessible to us most of the time, or else is intrinsically
inaccessible to us. So, we shouldn’t be surprised that some people function
efficiently without an elaborate self-consciousness about themselves.

GS: I quite agree. One famous remark made on the other
side was made by Socrates when he said, ‘The unexamined
life is not worth living.’ But I think you can agree with
him that we need to be reflective about our lives in certain
ways without having to set it out as a narrative. If you’re
just trying to regiment your life into some satisfying
narrative in order to make sense of it, you may just be
missing out on almost everything that matters. One remark
I particularly like was made by the famous short story
writer V. S. Pritchett who said, ‘We live beyond any tale that
we happen to enact.’

Other people I’d call in support of my view include Marcel
Proust. He’s a very good example. He has this notion of le vrai
moi, the ‘true me’: it’s not that you have a continuing narrative
that shows what it is. The ‘true me’ is something, rather, that
emerges at certain moments—there’s that famous, over-
quoted moment when he dips his biscuit in the cup of tea and
suddenly he’s plunged in memory, back as he was when he
was nine. He has this conception of the ‘true me’ as something
that’s completely outside of the story of your life. The
narrative is just the contingency of your actual life and not the
essence of what matters about you.

NW: So what does matter about you then?

GS: Actually, the more I think about this, the more I’m
attracted by the idea that you have a unique essence. I think
some people are going to live lives that are really at odds with
what their essence is. But if things go well, you find a way to
express it in your life. But it isn’t as if the narrative details of
your life are what matter most. In a sense they matter least.

NW: So that essence, judging from something you’ve said in passing
before, may be largely given genetically. It may also be something outside
your control.

GS: Yes—and it would be equally outside your control even
if it was something that was caused in you by early experience.

NW: Choosing the word ‘essence’ makes it sound like the soul, or
something mysterious that just is there in us, whether or not we realize
it’s there. That fits with certain literary interpretations—people not living
up to their true selves—and it fits with many people’s intuitions, I’m sure.
But it also has this arcane, almost esoteric, ring to it. Is this what a
philosopher should be examining, this mysterious essence?

GS: Well, I’m already slightly regretting using the word
‘essence’ like that, but I’m probably going to stick with it.
Maybe Sartre could come in again here, because he pointed
out that the standard view in philosophy was that essence
precedes existence, so that you have your essence and your
existence unrolls out of it, as it were. In response, he gave his
famous slogan ‘existence precedes essence’. For him,
somehow, existence, the contingencies of life, were what
fundamentally constituted you, and your essence was just
that. In contrast with Sartre, I think that it’s principally a fact
about genetic constitution and early upbringing. We are
unique and idiosyncratic—in good ways and in bad ways.
There just are best ways for our lives to go as a result, but
this is because of the way we already are. I don’t think
experience can change us that radically, beyond a certain
point—trauma aside.

NW: Does it follow from this that we could get a better sense of who
we are through introspection? Can we get access to that essence somehow?

GS: I’m still regretting the word ‘essence’. And as for
introspection—unsupervised, purely personal
introspection—I’m quite dubious about whether it works. I’ve
already mentioned that Socrates said, ‘The unexamined life is
not worth living’, but sometimes I think that the examined life
can turn into the over-examined life and be even worse, and it
may well be that you need a little help if you want to go into
this kind of self-examination.

NW: If this ‘true me’, what you’ve called the essence of the self, is so
important to us, how do we go about finding out what it is?

GS: Every time you use the word ‘essence’, I’m going to say
I regret having brought it into the conversation! I think it may
be a bit like what they say in sports psychology, that you have
to relax into the shot and not think about it. Maybe you
have to do some of that with your own life. You have to
somehow just relax. Then perhaps you can hear what’s
going on, how you are, as it were.
