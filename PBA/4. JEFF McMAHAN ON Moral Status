Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Again

MORALITY

JEFF McMAHAN ON 
Moral Status

David Edmonds: A stone on the beach, we assume, has no moral
status. We can kick or hammer the stone, and we’ve done the stone no
harm. Typical adult human beings do have moral status. We shouldn’t,
without a good reason, kick people. Often, contentious moral issues,
such as embryo research, or abortion, or whether to turn off a life
support machine, turn on disagreement about the moral status of the
embryo, foetus, or individual—so the key questions are who or what
has moral status, and why? Jeff McMahan takes on these tricky
questions.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we’re going to focus on today is humans
and moral status. Let’s start at the beginning—what is moral status?

Jeff McMahan: To have moral status is to have certain moral
claims against others for one’s own sake. Moral status is based
on intrinsic properties possessed by an individual that
ground moral reasons for treating that individual in certain
ways—reasons that may differ from those deriving solely
from the individual’s interests.

NW: What do you mean by an intrinsic property? Could you give an
example?

JM: Sure, the possession of the capacity for self-consciousness,
or minimal rationality, or a moral sense. Usually, the founda-
tions of moral status are thought of by most people as
psychological capacities of some sort; but some people of a
religious inclination think that it might be something like the
possession of a soul.

NW: Does that mean that moral status is all-or-nothing; that you
either have it, or you don’t?

JM: There are different ways in which the term is used. Some
people use it in that way. I prefer to think of moral status as a
matter of degree, and that some individuals have a higher
moral status than others. You might think that there are some
individuals who have a minimal kind of moral status—that
is, they might have sentience, or bare consciousness—and
this provides a basis for their having interests, and many
philosophers think that our treatment of those beings should
be governed solely by a concern for their interests. But their
being sentient gives them a moral status that plants lack,
though some philosophers claim that plants also have interests.

NW: So, what you’re saying is that there is both a range of statuses
that could be occupied by human beings, and that there’s a hierarchy. Not
all human beings have equal moral status?

JM: That would be my view. A more common view is that
all human beings have the same moral status.

NW: One finds the idea that people all have the same moral status
in Christianity, in Immanuel Kant, and elsewhere: there are lots of
philosophers who think that that kind of equality is a starting point for
ethics. How do you reach the position that some individuals can have a
higher moral status than others?

JM: One way to do it is to compare human beings with
non-human animals. If you look at the candidate properties
that people have suggested as the foundation or ground of
human moral status, you will find that, in general, there are
some human beings who seem to lack those properties, and
there are some animals who seem to have them.

NW: Could you give me an example of two human beings who have
radically different moral status?

JM: Yes. An adult human being with normal psychological
capacities, in my view, has a higher moral status than a
human foetus that hasn’t yet acquired the capacity for
consciousness. I think that an adult human being with normal
psychological capacities also has a higher moral status than a
late-term foetus that does have the capacity for conscious-
ness. I also think that a normal adult human being has a
higher moral status than a newborn infant.

NW: That makes everything much more complicated because if
you’ve got a ‘one size fits all’ approach to moral status, you could say
‘every human being has the same kind of rights, we’re all equal’; so
when someone has something bad done to them, you know automatic-
ally that that is something that shouldn’t have happened. It seems to be
a consequence of your view that we have to know quite a lot about
the victim of an abuse of rights before we can determine how bad the
action is.

JM: Yes, and I think that’s quite plausible, and consistent with
most people’s intuitions. Most of us believe, for example, that
the killing of a 10-year-old child is a tragedy; but if we hear
about an abortion that kills a foetus a month after conception,
most of us won’t think that the month-old foetus was the
victim of grave wrongdoing, or of a terrible misfortune.

NW: We’re talking in particular about humans and their moral status.
When does a human start to exist as a human? Some religious people
argue that sperm are sacred, but most people don’t believe that. What
about a fertilized egg? Is that a human? Don’t we face a kind of Sorites
problem when we try to identify the point when it becomes a human being?
At what point does it start to have any rights at all?

JM: Most people believe that people like you and me began
to exist at conception, when a new living entity came into
existence as a result of the fusion of a sperm and an egg cell.
It’s really quite implausible, metaphysically, to suppose that
I ever existed as a sperm or as an egg. However, there are also
good arguments against the idea that we began to exist at
conception. My view is quite radical. I don’t think that we are
human organisms at all. I think that we begin to exist when a
conscious subject begins to exist in association with the human
organism, which occurs about five months into pregnancy. My
view is that, before that time, there is a living human organism;
but that living human organism, in my case, wasn’t me, but
was the vehicle through which I came into existence. So I take
the same metaphysical and moral view about early human
embryos that many people take of a sperm and egg pair prior
to conception. I think that an early human embryo is just
the physical material out of which someone like you or me
may develop.

NW: That’s interesting. That’s not unlike what John Locke says about
the difference between being a person and being a man, as he put it—by
which he meant man or woman. The man is the animal, what you call
the organism, which may or may not go together with consciousness. But
it’s the consciousness that makes us a person, and the consciousness which
makes us morally significant to each other.

JM: That’s right. I see my view as being in the Lockean
tradition. The view that I hold implies that there are actually
two distinct entities sitting in the chair that I’m sitting in at
the moment. There’s a living human organism and there’s
me, and if you want to ask, ‘Well, what am I?’, I’m not a soul
or an immaterial substance, or something like that. I am
actually a part of my organism. I am the part of my organism
that generates consciousness and mental activity. I am, in
effect, those parts of my brain in their active, or potentially
functional, state which are capable of generating conscious-
ness and mental activity. It’s on the basis of that metaphysical
view that I believe that we come into existence a little after
the middle of pregnancy.

NW: Well, we come into existence then as conscious beings, but we
have the potential to do so before consciousness emerges—and lots of
people think that it’s the potential that’s important. So they may accept
your metaphysical account of what it is to be fully human, but still believe
that the organism that is the precursor to the conscious being has rights
just because it has the potential to become this full human being.

JM: Well, the organism becomes me only in a rather peculiar
sense. It doesn’t ever become me in the sense of ever being
identical with me; it becomes me in the sense of co-existing
with me. The form of potential that is at issue here is what
I call ‘non-identity potential’, where the thing that has a
certain potential actually never will be identical with the thing
it has potential to give rise to. Think of the wooden chair that
I’m sitting on. If we were to put it through a grinding
machine and turn it into sawdust, we might say before that
that the chair has the potential to become a pile of sawdust.
But once it has fulfilled that potential, it has actually ceased to
exist. What exists after we’ve run the chair through the
grinder is a pile of sawdust, not a chair. Now, that doesn’t
happen in the case of the human organism and the person.
The human organism continues to exist in association with
the person. It gives rise causally to the existence of the person;
but the person, or the conscious subject is, in my view, never
actually identical with the organism. So the organism doesn’t
have the relevant kind of potential in its relation to the later
person to have rights on that basis. The relevant kind of
potential is what I call ‘identity preserving’—it’s the kind of
potential that Prince Charles has to become the King of
England. If Prince Charles becomes the King of England, the
King of England will then be identical with Prince Charles in a
way that this wooden chair would not be identical with the
pile of sawdust that it has the potential to become.

NW: What does your view entail about the moral status of an early
embryo?

JM: An early embryo, at least after about a fortnight after
conception, is a human organism that is in a quite literal
sense unoccupied: that is, it’s an organism that is not host to a
conscious subject or a person like you or me. It is devoid of
any intrinsic moral status. It has the same moral status that
an individual sperm or an individual egg has. So, if one were
to destroy a human embryo, one would not be killing or
destroying anybody like you or me; one would be preventing
one of us from coming into existence. The destruction of a
human embryo is morally indistinguishable, I think, from
contraception.

NW: Does that mean it would be morally acceptable to use, say,
aborted embryos for experimentation—perhaps in preference to using
sentient animals?

JM: Yes, that is actually an implication of my view that most
people would find morally repugnant—but I think it’s actually
correct. It is permissible to experiment on embryos, provided
they’re never going to develop into persons: that is, provided
that their maturation is stopped before they ever give rise to
the existence of an individual who would have moral status.

NW: What of a parallel situation; what if somebody who has had
the kind of sentience that you were talking about enters a persistent
vegetative state? Does that mean that they then have the moral status of
an embryo?

JM: Not entirely. Let me say something first about the
metaphysical status of individuals in a persistent vegetative
state, and then say something about the moral status of
individuals in a persistent vegetative state.

There are different types of vegetative state; in some cases,
the physical basis for consciousness in the brain has been
irreversibly destroyed. In these cases, in my view, the
individual person has ceased to exist. There is a living human
organism, but metaphysically it is quite like the embryo in
that it is a living human organism that does not sustain the
existence of a person. In that kind of case, though, the moral
status of the human organism isn’t exactly the same as that
of an embryo, because the individual who once co-existed
with that organism, and whose organism that was, may have
had desires about what was to be done to that organism—and
I think we have moral reason to honour those preferences, in
just the same way that we have reason to honour people’s
wishes about other matters after they have ceased to exist.
When a person ceases to exist, they don’t cease to exert moral
constraints on us, or moral pressures of certain sorts.

There’s another kind of persistent vegetative state, however,
in which the brain hasn’t irreversibly lost the capacity to
support consciousness. In that case, the individual continues to
exist, and is still there as a proper subject of moral concern
and, arguably, even if this individual has suffered certain sorts
of brain damage, retains the same kind of status that he or she
had prior to going into the persistent vegetative state. It
follows that we should, to the best of our ability, do what’s in
this individual’s interests and honour this individual’s
autonomous preferences, in so far as we can ascertain what
they are.

NW: Getting these questions right really matters, because it could be
somebody’s life depending on it. How do you justify your account, which
rests so much on this notion of sentience? How do you know you’re right?

JM: You are right that these issues are extremely important.
They are also extremely difficult, and a lot of people don’t
appreciate that. Most people have views about these issues. If
you were to ask them to defend those views, they would give
you a fairly simplistic response. It took me more than a
500-page book to give the arguments that support my
conclusions here, so I’m not actually going to be able to give
you the arguments. But that’s what you should expect. If you ask
me to explain to you the nature of physical reality according to
quantum theory and the best contemporary physics, I wouldn’t
be able to do that simply in five minutes, either. A lot of it has to
do with the metaphysics. We need to understand when it is we
begin to exist, and when it is we cease to exist. We can’t under-
stand that, in my view, until we understand what kind of thing
we essentially are. Are we essentially living biological organisms?
If I were to pose that question, most people would say yes—but
actually most of them don’t really believe it, because they believe
that they will survive the deaths of their physical organisms.
They believe that their physical body will die and disintegrate,
but that they will continue to exist.

The view at which I have arrived is that we begin to exist
when there is someone there, rather than just something—
someone who has the capacity for consciousness. One has to
do some serious metaphysics to have defensible views about
when we begin to exist and when we cease to exist. Until one
has done that work, one really isn’t entitled to strong moral
views about the moral status of an embryo, or a human
individual in a persistent vegetative state, or indeed a human
individual who has been declared brain-dead, but whose vital
functions are still being maintained by means of minimal
external life support.

Once one has done the metaphysics, then one has to
confront challenges to the consistency of one’s moral beliefs
about the remaining cases. I believe that late-term human
foetuses are individuals like you and me, although our natures
were very different when we were late-term foetuses or
newborn infants. Then our psychological capacities were no
higher than those of certain non-human animals. Most people
believe that a late-term human foetus has a higher moral status
than, say, an adult chimpanzee, even though the chimpanzee’s
psychological capacities are uniformly higher. They may
claim, for example, that that is because the foetus has the
potential to have higher capacities than those of the
chimpanzee, as you suggested earlier. I don’t think that mere
potential confers moral status in that way. And, in any case,
there are some human foetuses that lack that potential because
their brains have failed to form in the necessary ways. But both
the metaphysics and the morality are difficult, and I can’t be
sure I’ve got them right.

NW: So, what you’re saying is that before you can make a judgement
about moral status, you have to understand the metaphysics of what it is
to be a person. And a consequence of that is that most people aren’t
actually equipped to make judgements about moral status.

JM: Unfortunately, I think that that’s correct. These are
issues about human beings (and other animals) whose nature
is in some sense non-standard: embryos, foetuses, newborn
infants, adults with certain cognitive impairments or radical
deficits. These are individuals about whose moral status we
should not have confident intuitions and confident moral
views. Questions about abortion, the termination of life
support, euthanasia, and so on, are really very difficult. We are
right to be puzzled about these issues, and people who think
that they know the answers and have very strong views about
these matters without having addressed the difficult issues in
metaphysics and moral theory are, I think, making a mistake.
They should be much more sceptical about their own beliefs,
and much more tentative about what they are willing to
impose on other people through political institutions.
