Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Again

FREE WILL,
RESPONSIBILITY,
AND PUNISHMENT

NICOLA LACEY ON 
Criminal Responsibility

David Edmonds: Suppose in the jungle I shoot a man thinking he was
a threatening tiger. Have I killed the man intentionally? It’s the sort of
conundrum that keeps lawyers, as well as philosophers, happily
preoccupied. There appear to be a number of factors that need to be in
place before someone is held criminally responsible for an action, such as
whether they know what they’re doing, and whether they should know
what they’re doing. These, in a way, are timeless considerations. They
apply to a criminal action now, or one hundred years ago, but Nicola
Lacey argues that there’s also an historical component to criminal
responsibility that can’t be ignored. The concept of criminal responsibility
makes sense only within the particular institutional framework in which
it operates.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we’re going to focus on is criminal
responsibility. Could you just begin by outlining what criminal
responsibility is?

Nicola Lacey: We use the term ‘responsibility’ in lots of
different ways when we’re talking about the criminal law.
Sometimes, if we talk about someone being criminally
responsible, we’re simply referring to the fact that they’ve
been convicted; but, actually, when lawyers talk about criminal
responsibility, they are usually separating out just one of the
components that feeds into a justified criminal conviction, and
that has something to do with not just the person’s conduct,
but the attitude or state of mind with which they engaged in
that conduct. To show that someone had not only done an act,
but was responsible for having done it, certain other
conditions would have to be fulfilled. Those conditions are
generally thought to be relevant to whether it is fair to hold
someone responsible, and whether it is fair, therefore, to
convict them.

NW: So, if I flick a switch on the wall and, unbeknownst to me, it’s
attached to somebody else, and I give them an electric shock that’s fatal,
I probably wouldn’t be criminally, or morally, responsible for that act.

NL: Exactly. We draw a rough common-sense distinction
between things that are accidental—things that just happen—
and things that people make happen, or intend. Take an
example I like to use with students. I’m in a crowded
underground station, at the top of an escalator, somebody
jolts me, I bump into the next person, she falls and she’s
injured. I’m responsible in some very minimal sense, perhaps,
but essentially most people would call that an accident. If, on
the other hand, I take a dislike to the person in front of me
and give him a shove, intentionally, that is clearly a case where
I’m responsible. Lawyers tend to like Latin tags, so it’s often
known in criminal law as mens rea (guilty mind), and it consists
in a number of different mental states or attitudes: good
examples would be intention—the fact I do something
intentionally, purposely, with relevant knowledge of the
surrounding circumstances, or perhaps foreseeing a certain
outcome. Suppose I don’t intend a person I push on the
escalator to fall, but I do foresee that there’s a risk of that, then
that would be recklessness. So there isn’t one way of proving
responsibility in criminal law, but there is a philosophical idea
that arguably holds them all together: that it is only fair to
hold someone accountable if they’ve done something in
circumstances in which they had a fair opportunity to do
otherwise.

NW: So, what would that amount to?

NL: Well, in one very famous and influential account, by
the legal philosopher H. L. A. Hart, it consists of two
different sorts of components which have to do with the
capacities of the person: it’s only fair to hold someone
responsible if they knew what they were doing, and they had
a fair opportunity to do otherwise—they had a fair
opportunity to conform their conduct to the law. That
implies something not only about their own capacities, but
also something about the law itself. The law has to be
possible to comply with, and also capable of being known, so
reasonably clear. So there’s a connection between criminal
responsibility and the idea of the Rule of Law.

NW: So if I commit a crime and fulfil some of this cluster of volition
and knowledge of what I’m doing, the sorts of characteristics that you
talked about as mens rea, then that makes me criminally responsible for
what I’ve done.

NL: That would be the most common view among lawyers
of criminal responsibility. Of course, the capacity-based
theory of criminal responsibility, which I’ve just set out for
you, is not the only one within the philosophy of criminal law.
For example, in recent writing, there has been a revival of
interest in Aristotelian virtue-centred theories of criminal
responsibility, in which the argument is that, when you hold
someone responsible, an attribution of responsibility is in
effect a judgement that bad character has been exhibited in the
person’s conduct. That difference between a virtue-ethics
approach to criminal responsibility and the more
psychological, capacity-based fairness argument is quite
interestingly related to different notions of what kind of a
thing criminal law is: whether it’s a very finely textured,
institutionalized form of moral evaluation, or whether it’s a
practical, regulatory system, which is, however, subject to
certain kinds of normative or moral constraints.

NW: Suppose I’m usually very law abiding, and then somebody treads
on my toe at the wrong moment and I swing my fist out in anger and I
knock somebody out. It’s completely out of character as it happens. How
would the two different approaches differ in how they would treat me?

NL: Things get even more complicated here, I’m afraid,
because the character theorists don’t necessarily agree.
Some character theorists would say, ‘Well, if it’s out of
character, then it’s not a real expression of that person’s
character, and therefore we shouldn’t hold him responsible’;
whereas others would say, ‘But, actually, what’s going on
here is that a characteristic has nonetheless been expressed:
this conduct expresses a bad disposition, and that’s what’s
blameworthy.’ On the fairness view, the sort of view Hart
endorsed, it’s all going to turn on whether we think that the
person had a fair opportunity to avoid this conduct, so the
question of whether it’s out of character or not isn’t the
relevant question.

NW: We‘ve been discussing Hart, who wrote in the twentieth century,
and we’ve mentioned Aristotle, who wrote in the fourth century bc, as if
they were contemporaries discussing the same issue. Is that acceptable?

NL: Not from my point of view. I think that’s a really good
question. Clearly, you can find aspects of the concept of
responsibility among which you can see commonalities
going back to Aristotle, going through the Christian
tradition in Enlightenment philosophers of various kinds, in
twentieth-century linguistic philosophy, in liberal political
theory, and so on, so it’s not as though we can’t have a
meaningful conversation about the concept of responsibility.
However, when we think about criminal responsibility in the
sense of how responsibility operates as a component of how
we attribute liability in criminal law, there is another factor
which is highly relevant to how ideas of responsibility work:
that is, how criminal law is institutionalized. We sit here and
have a debate about whether someone who injures
somebody else when they’re very drunk is really responsible.
That’s a very pure, intellectual, moral argument. If we ask,
‘Should that person be held legally responsible?’, then we
immediately assume a set of institutions, institutions that
allow you to prosecute, that formulate rules in relation to
which a prosecution takes place, and perhaps, most
relevantly, produce a forum in which we have a debate
about proof—in other words, a trial. If you go back 250 or
300 years, just in England and Wales, you would see a
completely different sort of trial process for the vast majority
of criminal cases.

NW: So how were things different in England in the eighteenth
century?

NL: I can give you an idea of this with something very basic,
which is that historians have calculated that the average length
of a trial in the late eighteenth century was approximately
15 minutes. You can tell immediately that a 15-minute process
was not a process in which it was very likely that cognitive and
volitional capacities and fair opportunities of the kind that we
were talking about could genuinely be the object of
investigation and proof. This was a much more rough-and-
ready process. But it’s not just the length of the trial: until
1836, felony defendants, in other words the more serious of
the criminal defendants, didn’t have a right to be legally
represented—very often, there were no lawyers present in
criminal cases. You didn’t have systematic law reporting, you
didn’t have a hierarchy of appeals, there was no police force
until well into the nineteenth century. So how did the criminal
law work? Of course, it had some resources that we don’t have
so much these days—particularly local knowledge. Cases got
into the trial process through local information filtered
through magistrates. My assumption is that the vast majority
of trials operated on the basis of an assumption of guilt and
responsibility, in the sense that if somebody had got
themselves into the courtroom they were probably a bit of a
bad lot. The trial gave that defendant a chance to exculpate
himself, usually by calling on character witnesses to speak up
for their credibility.

NW: So that obviously contrasts strongly, we hope, with what goes on
in a trial today. What can we learn from that contrast?

NL: What I’m interested in here is the degree to which, and
the way in which, concepts that are operationalized within
institutional frameworks actually affect the tone and shape of
those concepts. We couldn’t have mobilized ‘responsibility’
as we understand it today, except within certain kinds of
institutional infrastructure. I want to put that sort of history
of philosophical ideas within much more of an institutional
framework. The reason this is important in terms of
contemporary criminal law theory of a philosophical temper
is that the tendency to take a sophisticated theory, which is in
a sense a theory of moral responsibility, and just assume that
we can project it onto criminal law, has very often made us
ignore aspects of criminal law as a social practice which simply
don’t match up to those philosophical criteria. We’ve missed a
trick, in terms of looking at the texture of criminal law to see
whether there’s more than one conception of responsibility at
play within this practice, and hence an opportunity to learn
something about how law is different as a social practice and a
social discourse from moral discourse and argumentation.

NW: Are you saying that there’s more than one concept of
responsibility that applies within the realm of the criminal law, or rather
that we have one concept that’s a moral concept of responsibility, and
another that is overlapping with it perhaps, but not exactly congruent
with it, which is the area of criminal responsibility?

NL: There’s more than one way in which we structure our
practices of responsibility attribution in criminal law. Perhaps
the most influential and appealing account is this account
based on engaged volitional and cognitive capacities:
intention, knowledge, recklessness, and so on. But the
criminal law quite often attributes responsibility based on the
idea that we have simply caused an outcome. Let’s go back to
the escalator example, an example where somebody else
shoves me, and I accidentally shove the next person, and she’s
hurt. In terms of the cognitive and volitional idea of
responsibility—the fairness idea of responsibility—we don’t
think that I’m responsible in the same way. On the other hand,
here’s a thought experiment. Imagine that the person who’s
injured turns round and remonstrates with me and says, ‘That
was really bad’, and I say, ‘Well, it’s nothing to do with me, it’s
just an accident’, and just walk away: I don’t help her get up,
I don’t show any concern for her. That, surely, is a morally
unappealing position, and we do feel that I’m in some sense
related to this outcome in a morally relevant way. Now, the
criminal law thinks that’s even more relevant: criminal law
often holds us responsible for outcomes that we cause, even
without these more muscular forms of responsibility like
negligence, let alone foresight, knowledge, or intention.

NW: Could you give an example of that?

NL: Many road traffic offences, for example, speeding.
There’s no defence to a speeding offence to say that you didn’t
mean to do it, or you just didn’t look at the speedometer. Over
half of criminal offences, on a good calculation, are either
offences of so-called strict liability—in other words, no need
to prove intention or knowledge or recklessness—or,
interestingly, a very important category, they’re offences
where you don’t have to prove so-called mens rea—criminal
responsibility in the cognitive or volitional sense—in relation
to one or more elements. Murder, what many people think of
as the paradigm criminal offence, is, you might guess,
intentional killing, and it’s true, in a sense, that that would be
a rough-and-ready definition of murder in English criminal
law. But, in fact, the so-called mens rea, the responsibility
element of the murder, consists of an intention, either to kill
or to cause grievous bodily harm. Perhaps an even more
clear-cut example would be the case of assaulting a police
officer in the execution of his or her duty. I have to have
so-called mens rea for the assault; but if I’m unaware that it’s a
police officer in the execution of his or her duty, that’s no
defence. So there are numerous offences in criminal law in
which there is not a complete requirement of proving
responsibility. My point is that that makes a real difference to
what kind of phenomenon criminal law is, as a social practice,
which should be of interest to philosophers of criminal law.

NW: Is it fair to sum up what you’ve been saying as this: the notion of
criminal responsibility isn’t fixed for all time; it’s actually partly
determined socially and scientifically. What counts as criminal
responsibility today is different from what it was in the eighteenth
century, and it will inevitably be different in 100 years’ time, or 50 years’
time even?

NL: That is a fair summary of what I’m saying, although I
don’t want to exaggerate it in the sense that I still think there
will be family resemblances. It’s not that the debates about
criminal responsibility will be unrecognizable to a twenty-first-
century reader, or in the twenty-third century. As we can see,
there’s a continuity. For example, some of the issues that
neuroscience is now raising were raised within Darwinism
and eugenics in the nineteenth century. So there are
commonalities. Nonetheless, the changing environment and
goals and institutional frame in criminal law make a difference
to how we can think about criminal responsibility.
