Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Again

METAPHYSICS, MEANING,
AND REASON

STEPHEN NEALE ON 
Meaning and Interpretation

David Edmonds: ‘How do you feel about Women’s Rights, Groucho
Marx?’ ‘I like either side of them’, he replied. ‘A child of five could
understand this’, said Groucho. ‘So get me a child of five.’ Sometimes it
seems that a sentence can semantically mean one thing and so be interpreted
in one way, but is intended to mean something else. A central theme in the
philosophy of language is working out what ‘meaning’ means, what it is for
a speaker or writer of a sentence to mean something by a sentence. Can I
just read off the meaning of a sentence by the definitions of the words I use
and the order in which these words are placed? Or are the words just clues to
what I mean? Is the meaning of a sentence dependent on its context?
Stephen Neale is at the City University of New York.

Nigel Warburton: We’re going to focus on the topic of meaning and
interpretation. It would be quite useful to separate out those two. What
are they? What’s meaning? What’s interpretation?

Stephen Neale: To interpret is to draw an interesting
conclusion about something. A geologist is interpreting when
she draws conclusions about a volcanic eruption on the basis
of facts about lava composition, stratigraphy and ash
distribution. An archaeologist is interpreting when he draws
conclusions about a disinterred object on the basis of its shape
and material composition, the archaeological context, and
stratigraphy again. And you and I are interpreting when we
draw conclusions about what a speaker means by uttering
something, which can be quite different from what the
sentence he uttered means.

NW: I’d like to ask you to clarify the meaning–interpretation
distinction in connection with language. Let’s say I utter the words, ‘The
cat sat on the mat’, to describe something that happened in my house last
night. That sentence has a straightforward literal meaning which is,
presumably, connected to what I mean by uttering it. But an
interpretation is not something the sentence has; interpretation is what
somebody does: they hear me utter those words, or see that I wrote those
words down, and then they try and work out what I meant.

SN: That’s exactly right. When I’m working out what you
meant, I’m engaged in interpretation. And the conclusion I
reach is an interpretation of your utterance. We use the word
‘interpretation’ to describe both an activity, as you said, and
also the product of that activity. (We do the same thing with
the words ‘writing’ and ‘painting’.) But two important
distinctions are needed to make everything clear. The first is
between a sentence, which is an abstract object, and particular
utterances of that sentence, which are events taking place in
space and time. Think of the difference between a symphony
and various performances of it. The performances are events,
but the thing they are performances of, the symphony itself,
isn’t an event, it’s an abstract entity. The second distinction is
between two kinds of meaning: linguistic meaning, which
concerns what words, phrases, and sentences mean; and speaker
meaning, which concerns what people mean by uttering
words, phrases, and sentences. Right before we started
recording this conversation, you said to me, ‘We’re ready.’
What you meant was that you and David were ready to begin
recording. So what you meant was closely related to the
meaning of the sentence you used, but not identical to it.
The meaning of the sentence, ‘We’re ready’, doesn’t concern
you or David or recording.

NW: So what the sentence means is less specific than what I meant in
this example because of the pronoun ‘we’ and the lack of specificity
surrounding ‘ready’?

SN: That’s right. Another way to put the point is to say that
the meaning of the sentence is more abstract than anything a
speaker will mean in uttering it. The sentence meaning is really
a blueprint for the sort of thing a speaker can mean in uttering
it. To interpret your utterance, to work out what you meant,
I needed more than this blueprint because I needed to infer who
you meant by ‘we’ and what you meant you were ready for. In
a different context, you might utter, ‘We’re ready’, and mean
that you and Barry Smith are ready to perform the Monty Python
dead parrot sketch, and this would conform to the sentence’s
blueprint too. Many distinct possible speaker meanings conform
to a sentence’s blueprint, just as many distinct possible buildings
conform to an architectural blueprint.

NW: If interpreting an utterance is drawing a conclusion about what
the speaker means, the goals of a theory of meaning and a theory of
interpretation will be connected. Could you explain what the goals are
and how they differ?

SN: Yes, it irks me how often the goals get run together in
contemporary philosophy and cognitive science. To ask about
the nature of something—‘What is justice?’, ‘What is truth?’,
‘What is meaning?’—is to ask a constitutive question in
metaphysics, a philosophical question about the nature or
constitution of something. For speaker meaning, the
constitutive question is ‘What determines what a speaker
means by uttering something on a given occasion?’ Or, ‘In
virtue of what facts does a speaker mean whatever he or she
means?’ When you said, ‘We’re ready’, you meant that you and
David were ready to begin recording. What determined that?
What made that the case? A theory of speaker meaning
should provide a fully general answer, one that applies to
every case of speaker meaning. There’s nothing about the
meaning of ‘we’ or the meaning of ‘ready’ that made it the
case that you meant yourself and David by ‘we’, or that you
meant ready to begin recording by ‘ready’. The meaning of
‘ready’ is just a blueprint for the sort of thing a speaker can
mean by it. So is the meaning of ‘we’, which dictates only that
someone using it should mean himself or herself and at least
one other person—monarchs notwithstanding. It doesn’t
dictate that the other person has to be David Edmonds! So
something other than linguistic meaning made it the case that
you meant David and yourself by ‘we’. And it’s hard to see
how it could be anything other than your intention to be
talking about yourself and David. You intended and expected
me to recognize that you meant yourself and David by ‘we’.
The linguistic meaning of ‘we’ merely constrained the sort of
intention you could have if you were using the word with its
customary meaning. I had to infer whom you meant by ‘we’. It
wasn’t hard, but just knowing English, knowing the customary
meaning of ‘we’ wasn’t enough. I had to draw upon facts
about the context too. If I had interpreted you as meaning
that you and Barry Smith were ready to perform the dead
parrot sketch, then I would have misread your intentions and
got you wrong on two counts. I would have misinterpreted you.

NW: You said what question a theory of speaker meaning should
answer. Could you say what question a theory of interpretation is meant
to answer?

SN: It’s a question in cognitive science, a very different type
of question from the constitutive question about the nature
of speaker meaning. It’s this: ‘How do interpreters come up
with the interpretations they come up with about what
speakers mean?’ Somehow, we manage to do it, and typically
it involves no effort, or training, or conscious reflection. It’s
spontaneous. We have no choice unless we plug our ears.
I hear an utterance of ‘We’re ready’, and Bingo! An
interpretation pops into my head. Cognitive science aims to
explain how this happens, how I bring together information
about linguistic meaning, information derived from context,
and all manner of background information and beliefs stored
in memory, how I assess and integrate it, and finally reach a
conclusion about what the speaker means. The cognitive
processes involved are fast, automatic, largely beyond the
reach of conscious thought. I can’t choose to hear an
utterance of an English sentence as just sounds. I organize the
sounds into words and phrases, whether I want to or not.
I can’t choose to hear those words and phrases as devoid of
meaning. And I can’t decide not to interpret, not to draw a
conclusion about what the speaker means. All of this makes
utterance interpretation importantly different from the other
sorts of interpretation I mentioned at the beginning,
interpreting on the basis of lava samples or erosion patterns,
stratigraphy, pottery sherds, bone arrangements, and so on,
where special skills must be acquired on the basis of training.

NW: So when somebody does utter some words, where does the
meaning come from? Humpty Dumpty in Lewis Carroll’s Through the
Looking Glass famously said that he could use words to mean anything
he liked. That clearly wasn’t true.

SN: Right. And there are important lessons to be learned
from understanding exactly what Humpty Dumpty got
wrong. I’d like to come back to that if I may. But first I want to
separate the constitutive question about speaker meaning—In
virtue of what facts does the speaker mean whatever he or she
means?—from the constitutive question about linguistic
meaning—In virtue of what facts does a word or sentence mean
whatever it means? The answer seems straightforward for
sentence meaning: the meaning of a sentence is determined by the
meanings of its words and by principles governing the positions
those words occupy in the sentence’s grammatical structure—‘Tom
loves no one’ doesn’t mean the same thing as ‘No one loves
Tom’, for example. We can think of a sentence meaning as a
kind of structure whose basic elements are word meanings.
That structure is effectively a blueprint for the sort of thing a
speaker can mean in uttering it. But this still leaves word
meaning unexplained, so we certainly haven’t explicated
linguistic meaning yet—we haven’t said what it is, we haven’t
explained its nature. And we won’t, I claim, until we explicate
speaker meaning.

NW: Can you explain why you say that? Some people might believe,
perhaps naïvely, that what determines the meanings of words are their
dictionary definitions. When you utter certain words in an appropriate
order they just have a fixed public meaning. It seems counterintuitive to
say we need to explain the nature of speaker meaning to explain the
nature of linguistic meaning.

SN: Yes, it does at first. Words do have reasonably fixed
public meanings—reasonably fixed because a word can change
its meaning over time—the word ‘starve’ used to mean die, for
example. But at any given time, a word means whatever it
means independently of how any particular speaker plans on
using it. If a theory of the relationship between word meaning
and speaker meaning is to have any intuitive plausibility, it
must respect the fact that what a word means at a given time
imposes pretty serious constraints on what a speaker can mean
with it at that time. But there’s another fact the theory must
respect: that the meaning of the word at a given time is the
product of the myriad ways it has been used prior to that time
in acts of speaker meaning. If that weren’t the case, words
couldn’t change their meanings over time. But they do.
Meaning change usually takes place slowly, like tectonic shift,
but with the pressure for movement coming from acts of
speaker meaning piling up. So a word’s meaning at a given
time is effectively its potential for use in acts of speaker
meaning at that time. To know the word’s meaning is to know
that potential. And what makes this potential something we
can get our heads around is the systematicity imposed on it and
honed by prior acts of speaker meaning. (This can be
modelled using evolutionary game-theory.) So there’s
something right in the naïve view about word meaning. A
dictionary definition of a word is, in effect, an attempt to
capture facts about the word’s potential in acts of speaker
meaning, a potential that derives from its history in acts of
speaker meaning. You can’t keep speaker meaning out of the
picture! It’s the source of meaning: people meaning things by
doing things. As far as I’m aware, there’s no remotely plausible
alternative picture of word meaning. But we can’t provide
an account of word meaning along these lines without an
account of speaker meaning, obviously.

NW: So what is the nature of speaker meaning? What determines
what a speaker means by an utterance?

SN: I think Paul Grice was basically right: what the speaker
means is determined solely by certain complex intentions he
or she has in producing the utterance. The easiest way to
appreciate this idea is to start with a case in which the speaker
means something very different from what the sentence he
or she utters means. People speak ironically; they talk
metaphorically; they imply or insinuate things rather than
stating them outright. A famous example of Grice’s concerns
a professor who has been asked about the suitability of one of
his students for a philosophy job. His only comment is, ‘Smith
has wonderful handwriting and he’s always on time.’ That’s
it. What he means is that Smith is not suitable for the job, which
is not what the sentence means.

NW: The professor is ‘damning with faint praise’.

SN: Right. And we can provide a philosophical analysis of
the damning. Stating and implying are really two ways of
meaning something. The professor is implying, by omission
really, something that he would rather not state outright.
He means that Smith is not suitable for the job, though this
is not what the sentence itself means and not what the
professor states. (Maybe he also means that Smith has
wonderful handwriting and is always on time, maybe not,
depending upon how the example is filled out, but that
doesn’t matter here.) If the listener doesn’t realize that the
professor means Smith is not suitable for the job, then she
fails to grasp what the professor means: she misinterprets him.
This example underscores some important points about
interpretation. In most everyday situations, when we interpret
we end up latching onto what the speaker means—we don’t
care that much about what the words mean, or what the
whole sentence means. In fact, most of the time, we don’t
remember the exact words the speaker uses, even when we
remember the gist of what he meant. Words are simply
means to ends. So are their meanings. We’ve evolved to recover
what speakers mean and chuck out the rest. (I doubt you
remember the exact words the professor uttered in the
example. Did he say ‘excellent handwriting’ or ‘very neat
writing’ or something else?) What determines what the professor
meant by uttering ‘Smith has wonderful handwriting and he’s
always on time’? The natural answer is that what he meant is
what he intended to communicate.

Now Grice had a brilliant insight: if we can characterize
the nature of such intentions—which are often called
communicative intentions or meaning intentions—we will have
a fully general account of speaker meaning. A little phil-
osophy of mind is needed to understand Grice’s insight. We
have mental states—beliefs, desires, intentions, expectations,
and so on—about all sorts of things, including the mental
states of other people. We have beliefs about their desires,
desires about their beliefs, intentions about their desires,
beliefs about their intentions, and so on—higher-order
mental states, they’re usually called. A communicative
intention is a spectacular type of higher-order intention.
For you to have a communicative intention in uttering
something is for you to utter it intending to produce a specific
reaction in your addressee—his thinking something or doing
something—partly in consequence of his recognizing that
that’s the reaction you intend him to have. What you
communicatively intend your addressee to think or do is
what you mean.

NW: That sounds complicated. Could you run through an example to
bring it down to Earth?

SN: Let’s start with one that doesn’t involve language.
Suppose you and I are at a party. I’ve promised to give you
a lift home, and I know you want a reasonably early night.
I’m trapped talking to a terrible bore and want to get away.
I catch your eye across the room and yawn quite
ostentatiously. You nod discreetly and come over.
‘Goodness!’, you say, ‘look at the time. We need to go.’
What I mean by yawning ostentatiously—it’s my story, so
I’m allowed to stipulate the facts—is that you should come
over and rescue me so we can leave. What was my
communicative intention? Well, I yawned intending you to
come over and rescue me so we could leave, partly in
consequence of your recognizing that that’s how I intended
you to react. And it worked! This is a case of ‘speaker’
meaning without linguistic meaning. Humans have
developed the capacity to form and recognize intentions of
this complexity. It’s a remarkable capacity, one that
separates us from the rest of the animal kingdom. We do it
all day, usually effortlessly, automatically. It’s often claimed
that language distinguishes us from other species, but that
claim’s too vague to evaluate, and it could be trivially true or
trivially false, depending upon what you mean by ‘language’.
I think we’ve got much clearer conceptions of speech,
communication, and co-operation (for which we can give a
game-theoretic analysis). There’s a lot we don’t yet understand
about their emergence in human history, but the capacity to
cooperate and the capacity to have and to recognize
communicative intentions must have been instrumental in the
emergence of systems of gestural representation and speech,
forms of which have been around for tens of thousands
of years.

NW: Are you saying we have such complex intentions even when using
language?

SN: It’s controversial, but I think the answer is basically, ‘Yes’.
A language like English or Japanese is essentially a shared
system for generating reliable shortcuts to communicative intentions.
Let’s go back to the party. Instead of yawning, suppose I come
to you and say, ‘I’m leaving soon.’ I mean that I’m leaving the
party soon, but I also mean—it’s my story, I can stipulate—
that you should get ready to leave (if you still want a lift
home). I intend you to think that I’m leaving the party soon
and to get ready to leave, partly in consequence of your
recognizing that these are the reactions I intend you to have.
Once we reflect on why I’m justified in thinking you will
recognize how I intend you to react, we get a fix on the precise
role linguistic meaning plays. I expected you to know the
meaning of the sentence ‘I’m leaving soon’, a blueprint for the
sort of thing a speaker can mean in uttering it. We can make
this more precise by invoking the stating–implying distinction
again. I’m stating that I’m leaving soon and only implying that
you should get ready to leave. But I mean both things. To state
something with a sentence is to mean something that
conforms to its blueprint. When I utter, ‘I’m leaving soon’,
and mean that I’m leaving the party soon, I mean something
that conforms to the sentence’s blueprint. But I could use the
same sentence, in a different situation, and mean that I’m
leaving London soon, and that would also conform to the
blueprint. We use the blueprints but we customize all the
time when talking, and sometimes the blueprint itself
demands customization, as the blueprint for ‘leave’ does.
When I use ‘leave’, there must be somewhere or something or
someone that I mean I’m leaving. No one can just leave punkt.
We can use your utterance of ‘We’re ready’ to make the point
clearer. The meaning of ‘We’re ready’ specifies nothing about
recording or about you or David. But what you meant by
uttering it was that you and David were ready to begin
recording. When you use the word ‘ready’, there must be
something or other that you mean you’re ready for. No one can
be just ready punkt. If I’m ready to eat but not ready to go to
bed, am I ready? If I’m glad about getting a pay raise but not
glad I’m stuck in traffic, am I glad? These are silly questions
unless understood as filled out.

NW: Those are all cases where the sentence’s meaning, its blueprint,
demands customized speaker meaning. Are there cases where something
else demands it, common sense for example?

SN: This is controversial too, but again I think the answer is
basically: Yes. Suppose you come into my house and you look
very thirsty, and I open the fridge and say to you, ‘Take
anything you like.’ Now something’s gone very wrong if you
walk off with the fridge door, or the thermostat, or the cat.
I didn’t tell you those weren’t among the options I was offering
you. You just knew they weren’t—you knew that what I
meant by ‘anything you like’ was quite narrow. The sentence,
‘Take anything you like’, has a meaning, but you, the
interpreter, spontaneously imposed some constraints on how
far you thought I intended my utterance of ‘anything you like’
to stretch. The meaning of the sentence didn’t reveal to you
what the relevant constraints were; you had to infer them. But
what counts as getting the right constraints? Answer: getting the
constraints I, the speaker, intended. That’s why I say something’s
gone wrong if you walk off with the fridge door or the cat:
you’ve done something which doesn’t square with my
communicative intentions. There’s a degree of flexibility in
the precise content of my communicative intention, and
neither of us have to spell it out mentally in massive detail. If
you pour yourself a drink from a cold bottle of lemonade
that happens to be standing next to the fridge, or take tap
water, or take a yogurt from the fridge and a banana from a
bowl and make a smoothie, that would be fine. That’s because
it’s tacitly appreciated by both of us that the content of my
communicative intention is to some extent malleable or
sensitive to various social norms and relations, contextual
factors, and subtleties of various kinds.

NW: Lots of jokes are based on that kind of literal misunderstanding,
where somebody takes the words with fixed meaning and interprets them
without taking the context into account.

SN: That’s right. Context is one of the things speakers
expect interpreters to take into account in reaching
conclusions about what they mean. Normally, interpreters do
this automatically, without conscious effort. The sorts of jokes
you’re talking about trade on someone’s manifest failure to do
this. That’s what makes the jokes work. A theory of
interpretation must explain precisely what context is and how
it affects our mental processes. The context was something
I used—and something you tacitly expected me to use—in
identifying whom you meant by ‘we’ when you uttered ‘We’re
ready.’ You exploited the context without even realizing you
were doing it. So did I, in a reciprocal way. We do this sort of
thing effortlessly. Most of the time, at least.

NW: Can you bring the various pieces together by explaining how the
speaker’s expectation about the role of context in interpretation is
connected to the speaker’s communicative intention?

SN: Good. It’s really important to understand this.
Unfortunately it gets overlooked in the literature. When you
said, ‘We’re ready’, you intended me to think that you and
David were ready to begin recording, partly in consequence of
my recognizing that that’s what you intended me to think.
And that communicative intention alone constitutively
determined what you meant. So context did not constitutively
determine what you meant, not even partly. You, the speaker,
tacitly expected context to play a part in my coming to a
conclusion about whom you meant by ‘we’ and what you
meant you were ready for. The meaning of the sentence itself
didn’t tell me those things. So I tacitly drew on the context, just
as you tacitly expected me to, in identifying the content of
your communicative intention. In fact, you tacitly took
context into account in forming that communicative intention. So
context has a dual theoretical role: it figures in a theory of
utterance interpretation—which is also called a pragmatic
theory or pragmatics—and it also figures in a theory of
utterance construction and intention formation, which I have
called a formatic theory or formatics—which has been my main
interest of late. A pragmatics answers the question: How do
interpreters come up with the interpretations they come up with
about what speakers mean? A formatics answers the reverse or
mirror question: How do speakers come to form the communicative
intentions they have in producing the utterances they produce?
Sentence meaning has the same dual theoretical role. It figures
in a pragmatics because of its role in the interpreter’s reaching
a conclusion about what the speaker means. And it figures in a
formatics because of its role in the formation of the speaker’s
communicative intention in uttering whatever he or she
uttered.

NW: That brings us back to Humpty Dumpty. It’s sometimes said that
intentionalist theories of meaning must be Humpty Dumpty theories.

SN: The people who make this claim—literary and legal
theorists, linguists, and philosophers of language—are as
confused as Humpty Dumpty. Intentionalism is not
committed to the view that speakers and writers can mean
whatever they like using any words they like; and the reason is
obvious to anyone who’s reflected on what’s involved in
having an intention: you can’t intend what you believe to be
impossible. Or, if you prefer: you can’t intend to bring about a
state of affairs that you know you can’t bring about. It’s an old
point that’s often missed by opponents of intentionalism.
I can’t intend to swim to Australia tonight, because I know I
can’t succeed. Similarly, I can’t utter the sentence. ‘Fred reads
two novels a week’, right now and mean that Paris is the
capital of France—unless I’m speaking to you in some kind of
code that we have set up in advance. Anyone who claims that
intentionalism entails Humpty Dumptyism just hasn’t thought
about what’s involved in having a genuine intention. There’s a
more general moral here: you can’t really do the philosophy
of language properly without doing the philosophy of mind.

NW: In a conversation like the one we’re having, there are all sorts of
non-verbal aspects of communication, the tone of voice, the speed at
which somebody speaks, hand gestures, I may be communicating all kinds
of things. But when it comes to the written word, it strikes me many of
the cues about a writer’s intentions are just not present.

SN: That’s right, and it’s what makes interpreting written
texts, tape recordings, even friends on the phone, more
difficult. In a typical speech situation, the speaker utters
something, and the words used form a crucial part of the
evidence we use for identifying what the speaker means. As
you said, there’s also perceptual evidence—hand gestures, vocal
and visual clues and cues. And prior utterances and all sorts of
background knowledge provide further evidence. In principle,
we can draw on anything we like in trying to work out what
speakers mean. But when we interpret writing, the range of
evidence we can draw upon is typically narrower, for the
reasons you gave. Another difference is that more thought,
more effort, more time, often goes into writing and
interpreting writing. Even texting allows for editing before
messages get sent.

NW: Of course, not everyone agrees with you about the emphasis on
intention. Presumably, some people would put much more stress on the
public meaning of, particularly written words, so that the interpretation
that you give is based on the text in front of you, not on the presumed
intentions of the writer.

SN: Yes. This gets debated in legal theory. But there’s often a
serious misunderstanding of the sort of intentionalist position
I hold. I don’t claim that we base our interpretations on the
presumed communicative intentions of the writer, or that
those intentions are part of the evidence for a correct
interpretation. In fact, that gets everything backwards. The
writer’s communicative intentions aren’t evidence; they’re the
things we seek evidence for. I claim (a) that what the writer
means is settled by those intentions; and (b) that an
interpretation is a conclusion about what those intentions are, a
conclusion based on the available evidence. The text itself is
often the best evidence we have for them, and sometimes it
virtually exhausts the evidence. And that raises an important
issue in legal theory: What do you do when there’s a genuine
interpretive question about a statute that needs resolving and the text
itself doesn’t provide enough evidence to resolve it? The fact that
the legislators who enacted it may not be present to be
questioned about what they intended by this or that phrase is
not the real issue. Even if they were present, they’d squabble,
and most likely wouldn’t agree on an answer. Some voted
against the Bill, some wanted a different word here or there,
one even managed to get a phrase deleted at the last minute in
exchange for some shady land deal, and most of them never
read the thing in the first place. Perhaps some of it was drafted
by influential lobbyists or corrupt clerks attempting to thwart
the will of the legislators. So another question is: Whose
communicative intentions could we, or should we, be trying to
ascertain when reading a text that is meant to be understood as
produced by a legislature? It’s hard to provide a satisfactory
answer to this question, and that’s one reason some legal
theorists think the aim of statutory interpretation cannot be
identifying anyone’s intentions. So-called textualists say we
should stick to the language of the text without considering
anyone’s intentions, and resolve any looseness or ambiguity by
interpreting as an ordinary, reasonable person would. But
there’s an element of fantasy in this idea. It’s based on a naïve
picture of what we’re capable of doing. We’re not built like
that. We treat writing we encounter as the product of an
agent with communicative intentions, whether we want to or
not, and whether it’s a legal text or a sentence we know was
just produced randomly by some computer program. And
that applies just as much to writing produced by committee.
We are built to approach it as the product of a single agent.
Why? Because natural languages are evolved systems for generating
reliable shortcuts to communicative intentions—that’s really the
Gricean insight.

A lot of anti-intentionalist rhetoric is oblivious to facts
about the mind and about our use of language. It fails to
appreciate the special nature of communicative intentions, the
fact that linguistic meaning can provide at most blueprints for
speaker meaning, the ubiquitous role of inference in ascer-
taining meaning, and the nature of the cognitive processes
involved in ascertaining it. Of course, when something seems
very wrong, we can make conscious decisions to reject the
interpretations served up so automatically and effortlessly by
these cognitive processes. And when we have time to reflect,
as when reading, we can run through a range of possible
interpretations and choose one that suits the purpose at hand.
That’s what really happens in much legal interpretation. We
can go over the same ground time and again, bringing
different considerations to bear: traditional canons of inter-
pretation, prior decisions, considerations of absurdity, the
legislators’ expressed or assumed goals in enacting a particular
law. And different legal theorists have different opinions about
what counts as legitimate evidence.

NW: I know you’re in the unusual position for a philosopher of
language of having been involved in legal cases that turned on the
meaning of words. Could you say a bit more about that?

SN: In a sense, it’s a natural outgrowth of work that’s been
going on in the philosophy of language for the past twenty or
thirty years. It’s applied philosophy of language—the application
to areas outside philosophy of ideas, distinctions, arguments that
have been worked over by philosophers of language. I was asked
by the US government to help in a case some years ago, and one
thing led to another. I’m still appalled by some of the things
judges, officials, lawyers, and legal scholars say about language
and its use. Distinctions that seem obvious to philosophers are
routinely missed, and blatant falsehoods about language and
about intentions are presented as fact. Speaker meaning and
linguistic meaning get conflated; vagueness, ambiguity, and
underspecification are run together; constitutive and evidential
notions of determination get conflated; so do different notions
of context; and an unbelievable amount of nonsense gets talked
about ‘plain meaning’ and ‘ordinary meaning’. This intellectual
embarrassment is set to continue until the philosophy of
language gets onto the law school curriculum.

NW: Could you give an example of a case where there’s a problem?

SN: Smith v. the United States is a good one. John Angus
Smith traded a firearm, a modified MAC-10 and silencer for,
I believe, two ounces of cocaine, and was found guilty of a
drug-trafficking offence, which should have landed him a few
years in prison. But since he was also found to have ‘used’ a
firearm ‘during and in relation to’ a drug-trafficking offence,
he got thirty years. On appeal, Smith argued that since he had
used the firearm as barter, and not as a weapon, he had not
‘used a firearm’ in the sense meant in the statute. The US
Supreme Court disagreed. It upheld the original decision by
six votes to three. But both sides tied themselves in knots
talking about language and its use. The Justices did not
understand that the linguistic meaning of a sentence falls
short of fully determining what it is being used to state, and
so inevitably falls short of determining its contribution to
statutory content. Justice O’Connor, for example, said that if
the legislature had intended a narrow interpretation of ‘use a
firearm’, it could have indicated as much in the statute, but it
didn’t and it isn’t the job of the Court to impose this
‘additional requirement’. If she means the Court can’t just add
the words ‘as a weapon’ after ‘uses a firearm’ in the statute,
then obviously she’s right. But that’s not the issue. It’s whether
‘uses a firearm’ is meant to be understood as using a firearm as
a weapon. O’Connor says it shouldn’t, but her rationale is
confused. She says that when a word is not defined in a
statute, it’s standard practice to understand it as having its
‘ordinary’ meaning, which means understanding ‘use’ broadly
enough to include using a firearm as barter. But the issue isn’t
the meaning of ‘use’—‘ordinary’ or otherwise—the issue is
how ‘use a firearm’ is meant to be understood, which is
certainly constrained by the meaning of ‘use’. It’s similar to
the case of your utterance of ‘We’re ready’, which we’ve got
plenty of mileage out of already. I understood you as
intending ‘ready’ to be understood as ready to start recording,
and I was right. Just as there’s no such thing as just being ready,
so there’s no such thing as just using something. We can’t
seriously interpret someone’s use of ‘use a firearm’ as applying
to every conceivable thing one could do with a firearm!

Did I use gravity yesterday? Did I use the big bang? Did I use
a bike? I can’t answer without adding some detail. I didn’t ride
a bike yesterday, but I did arrange for a small package to be
picked up by a courier who arrived on a bike, so it seems fine
to say I used a bike to get a parcel to Holborn. If I had told my
daughter that I would cancel the order for her new bike unless
she behaved, would I have been using a bike? I’d have been
using one to influence her behaviour, I suppose. O’Connor
just doesn’t grasp the distinction between the meaning of a
word and how a speaker or writer intends it to be understood,
which is only constrained by its meaning.

We find the same basic problem in the dissenting opinion
written by Justice Scalia, who’s officially a textualist. He agrees
with O’Connor that non-technical words occurring in statutes
should be understood as having their ‘ordinary’ meanings, and
then goes on to claim that the ‘ordinary’ meaning of ‘use a
firearm’ is restricted to ways firearms are intended to be used
(by their manufacturers, I suppose), which does not include
bartering. So Smith didn’t ‘use’ a firearm. This happens to
coincide with the interpretation most people tend to come up
with if asked, and that’s primarily because it’s the one served
up by the largely automated, non-conscious cognitive mechan-
isms of interpretation I was talking about earlier—they are
highly sensitive to contextual considerations precisely because
they are geared to ascertaining speakers’ and writers’ communi-
cative intentions. But Scalia believes the object of statutory
interpretation is never to identify anyone’s intentions, and any
information interpreters have about legislators’ intentions is
irrelevant. So he can’t support his interpretation by saying it
captures the intent of the legislature, or even that it accords
with the interpretation ordinary speakers take to capture the
intent of the legislature. At most, Scalia can say it accords with
the interpretation ordinary speakers tend to come up with. And
he can’t attribute this to their loyalty to the ‘ordinary’ or ‘plain’
meanings of the words in question because the meanings of
words are much thinner, just blueprints.

Scalia has boxed himself in completely, made it impossible
for himself to justify the interpretation he favours, which is the
one automatically foist upon the intentionalist without bogus
appeals to ‘ordinary’ meaning and ‘ordinary’ speakers. Scalia
and O’Connor both claim to reject the idea that it is the
Court’s job to infer the full content of the statute from the
blueprint provided by the statutory language itself. But it’s
what both of them actually do! On the highest court in the
land, no less.

NW: So this whole case turned on the meaning of the word ‘use’. If
you use a gun in a drug-trafficking offence your tariff is immediately much
higher. Yet the intentions of the people who drafted that legislation clearly
weren’t that you can’t use it as the equivalent of money. They meant you
mustn’t threaten people, you mustn’t shoot a gun at somebody or fire it
over someone’s head.

SN: It turned on the difference between the meaning of the
phrase ‘use a firearm’, which is just a blueprint, and how it
was intended to be understood in the statute, which is only
constrained by its meaning. But it’s not that easy to say
precisely what the legislators intended by ‘use a firearm’,
even for someone convinced that Smith’s barter doesn’t
count. Discharging it? Pointing it at somebody? Threatening?
Does hitting someone with a rifle butt count? It’s not
clear-cut what counts as using a firearm in the intended sense.
O’Connor argues that what matters is whether it’s used in a
way that is material to the execution of the crime. But it’s
not clear-cut what that amounts to. Using a gun to scratch an
itch that is so intense that not scratching will scupper the
entire transaction?

NW: One interpretation of this case you mentioned is that it was just
a badly drafted law, that’s the weakness; it wasn’t that it turns on the
meaning of ‘use’.

SN: There’s a sense is which all laws are, and forever will
be, badly drafted. Inevitably, there will always be ambiguity,
vagueness, underspecification, various ways in which things
aren’t nailed down precisely by the meanings of the words
themselves. It takes pages and pages to say ‘Thou shalt not
steal’ in statutory language because getting it ‘right’—which
just means reducing the leeway or slippage to an acceptable
level—requires piling words onto the page. So legal prose is
always going to be drawn out and convoluted in the
Anglo-American world. A French law is different: it’s more
like a set of guidelines within which judges may operate, so
there’s no need for such wordiness. There appears to be a
fantasy in Anglo-American law that if you just get enough
words on the page, enough people working on it for long
enough, you can nail things down so there’s no slippage at
all. But that’s nonsense. There’s always going to be
interpretation that goes beyond identifying linguistic
meaning. When you hear a sentence, when you read a
sentence, you’re not simply involved in recovering linguistic
meaning on the basis of the meanings of the words and
their syntactic arrangement. You’re automatically involved
in interpreting, in working out what the producer of that
sentence meant.

The existence of perfectly good traffic signs shows that we
don’t always have to pile on the words. A sign that says, ‘No
Parking’, or displays the letter P with a red diagonal line
through it, can work perfectly well, even though it does not
specify where you can’t park. The person who put it up, or
ordered it to be put up, intended somewhere or other and the
driver is expected to infer where. There’s nothing in the sign to
indicate that it refers to itself—besides, the sign isn’t telling you
not to park on the sign or on the wall it’s attached to! It’s more
complicated than that, and the driver will draw upon the
physical context and all sorts of beliefs about cars, their sizes,
shapes, and so on. There’ll always be interpretation, and
there’ll never be a choice about that.

NW: Mightn’t it be said that the way language is used in the legal
context is that people draft legislation for a completely literal reading of
the text? So this is a special area of language use.

SN: It is. And you’re right, that does make a difference. We
don’t want irony and metaphor in our laws or in our traffic
signs; that would produce chaos. If we don’t treat legislation
as drafted literally and carefully, then we’re essentially
undermining the very idea of law. The law has to be accessible
in some public form or other, and judicial responses must be
reasonably predictable, otherwise the whole legal system
becomes a mockery. To that extent at least, written law is
quite different from ordinary speech. Now I don’t think we
have a good story yet of precisely what the difference amounts
to. To enact a law is to change the rights and obligations of
citizens, and the language the legislature selects to state that
change is the language the legislature is officially using to
communicate those changes to those to whom the changes
apply. There’s no way of squeezing communicative intentions
out of the picture. Utterances and inscriptions of words
are things we produce intentionally. So are the laws and poems
we use words to fashion. And so are the tools, weapons,
pots, ceremonial items, cave paintings, and jewellery that
archaeologists interpret. The types of intentions with which
we produce such things fit into an interesting hierarchy with
communicative intentions at the top. Archaeology shades into
palaeography, which itself shades into semantics, pragmatics,
formatics, and the philosophy of language. There’s no flight
from intention!
