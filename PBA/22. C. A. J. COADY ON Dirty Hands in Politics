Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Again

POLITICS

C. A. J. COADY ON 
Dirty Hands in Politics

David Edmonds: The former US Secretary of State for Defense,
Robert McNamara, an instrumental figure in the Vietnam War, offered a
list of principles for the conduct of foreign policy. Number nine was this:
in order to do good, you must engage in evil.

The idea that politicians have to follow a different moral code from the
rest of us has been explored by political theorists from Machiavelli in
the early sixteenth century to, in modern times, Princeton University’s
Michael Walzer. But what exactly is the claim being made here? Sure,
politics is messy, but does it really have its own specific moral realm? Here,
to tease out the arguments, is a renowned professor of moral philosophy,
Tony Coady.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we’re focusing on is dirty hands in
politics. Could you explain what the problem is?

Tony Coady: Well, there’s a technical problem of dirty
hands; there’s also a popular sense of dirty hands, which is
somewhat related. In the popular sense, people say, ‘We’re
really in a difficult situation now with the so-called “War on
Terror”, it’s a time for tough measures and we’ve got to get
our hands dirty.’ That can mean any one of numerous things:
it can mean, for example, we’ve got to take more risks than we
would previously have done, or that we’ve got to do dis-
tasteful things though they’re morally demanded.

But this is actually related to the philosophical topic,
because sometimes people mean, ‘The emergency is now so
great that we have to get our hands morally dirty. We have to
do things that we would normally regard as deeply immoral,
perhaps absolutely prohibited, but in this crisis, to avoid some
great evil, what we have to do is to break the moral law in
order to avert a disaster, or to achieve some very great good.’
And the technical sense of the term ‘dirty hands’ has been
made popular by Michael Walzer, who wrote a very influential
article about this in the early 1970s. Walzer has spent a good
deal of time since then trying to work out the implications of
his position, or what he actually meant.

There’s a difficulty in knowing how to characterize the
dirty-hands problem. It sounds like it’s saying that it’s
morally right to do what’s morally wrong. That appears to
be a flat contradiction. Michael Walzer once said to me,
probably as an ironic comment on the way he thinks
philosophers have misunderstood him, ‘Oh philosophers use
my article to show students basic philosophical mistakes!’
Well, I’m not sure it is a contradiction, but it has certainly
got an air of contradiction about it, and one of the things
I want to do is work out a satisfactory way of stating the
problem.

NW: The dirty-hands problem sounds like something Machiavelli said:
that to be a good leader, a leader must be prepared to do things that other
people would consider immoral—the morality of the leader is different
from the morality of other people.

TC: Well, Machiavelli is certainly part of a dirty-hands
lineage, but even your account of Machiavelli raises the
problem of unravelling what we mean by dirty hands. Is the
leader required to do something that other people think is
morally wrong, but actually it’s not wrong at all? In which
case all that is being said is that popular morality may be
misguided. That’s not paradoxical at all.

But sometimes it’s the second point you made: that
politics is different from ordinary life, that the political
leader has obligations of a special sort, and therefore that
these obligations allow him or her to do things that would
be morally wrong for other people to do. That’s a version
of what’s called, in the jargon, role morality. The idea is
that the special features of the leader’s role are such that
what would be morally wrong for ordinary people, or for
anyone in a different role, isn’t morally wrong for the
leader. Now, this is not stepping outside morality, but it is
f racturing morality. It is saying there’s this morality, that
morality, and then there’s political morality.

I think this is a very bad way to go. There’s some descriptive
truth in it, and some normative truth, in that there are
different roles in society, and we attach specific moral permis-
sions and prohibitions to these different roles—to doctors and
to lawyers, and so on. But that’s still within the framework of
a general morality which is more universal and deeper, and
in terms of which you can judge the role. If you stated the
dirty-hands problem in that way, then you’d still be in the
moral orbit. It would still be possible to say, ‘Alright, you’ve got
a different role, political leader, but it doesn’t license you to
torture someone’, for instance.

NW: So what is the real problem of dirty hands in politics?

TC: I think what Walzer usually means is that the political
order is such that sometimes a certain sort of necessity
overrides genuine morality. The conflict doesn’t occur within
morality, as it were, as in the story told about different
professions and groups having different roles. Rather, it takes
place, somehow, outside morality. In certain extreme
circumstances, there’s something higher or bigger, some-
thing more determinative. Machiavelli uses the term
‘necessity’ too.

Let me give an example, one that Walzer himself uses in his
original article. A political leader is facing terrorist threats.
This leader thinks torture is deeply immoral, as many of us do.
But now he’s got hold of a terrorist who knows where a bomb
is hidden. There’s limited time before this bomb detonates,
and he doesn’t believe he has any other options for finding the
bomb. This is now known as ‘the ticking bomb’ example. In
spite of his strong moral objections, the leader has to order the
torture of the person. According to Walzer, he should feel very
torn about this, and remorseful, for that shows that there
really is a moral thing that’s being overridden. Nonetheless, it’s
the right thing to do, in some sense of right.

I think this position makes a certain kind of sense if you
take the view that morality is not the whole of what’s to be
considered when you’re deciding what’s right or not right
to do.

NW: The way you’ve described it there, it’s a problem that can only
arise in really exceptional circumstances: it’s not an everyday occurrence.
And it’s a particular problem for politicians because they’re the ones with
huge responsibility for the fate of nations.

TC: Yes, that’s right. Walzer doesn’t rule out the possibility
that it can occur in a non-political context, and once you push
the argument hard, it’ll turn out that it isn’t specific to politics.
For instance, a mother in a war-ravaged situation may be in a
position where she thinks she has to violate some deep moral
constraint in order to save a child. So the stress on politics is
not as convincing as it normally sounds. But it’s always put in
political terms, and, as you say, politicians have big responsibil-
ities. So it’s plausible that though the dirty-hands problem is
not restricted to politics, it’s very prominent there. As to your
more general point about exceptional circumstances, Walzer
has moved somewhat from his original article, since now he
restricts the application of dirty hands to what he calls
‘supreme emergencies’, whereas one of the examples he gave
originally was a more commonplace one of a ‘good’ political
leader bribing a corrupt ward boss to deliver him vital votes
with the promise of improperly delivered school-construction
contracts.

NW: So do you think this is a genuine problem? Or do you think that
morality never comes into conflict with this other force?

TC: That’s a good question. I’ve spent a lot of time teasing
out this dirty-hands problem, and I began, and remain,
somewhat sceptical about it. I’m sceptical for a number of
reasons. One is that even if there are situations in which the
dirty-hands story makes some kind of sense, and is actually
true for somebody, it opens up a can of worms. Politicians can
start saying, ‘I’m a special kind of chap and I face these big
decisions and these supreme emergencies so I can violate deep
moral constraints with the blessing of philosophers.’ I’m very
nervous about that, and I’m particularly nervous about it with
the example I gave of torture. That’s a case where people have
resorted to the dirty-hands story far too readily and in many,
many cases, implausibly: the ticking bomb scenario is a very
implausible one when carefully considered, but it is initially
appealing to many people.

It’s also true that people sometimes confuse dirty-hands
situations with what philosophers call moral dilemmas.
They’re different. A moral dilemma is a situation in which
some dreadful emergency, or circumstance, arises, and
moral considerations of a deep kind pull in two different
directions. You’re then in a position where it looks as though
morality can’t decide for you, and whichever way you go,
you’ll have done a wrong. You might think that about
Sophie’s Choice, for instance. In the famous novel and film,
the Nazi officer said to Sophie, ‘You’ve got these two
children, you decide which one will die, and then I’ll let you
and the other one live.’ That’s a case where there isn’t a
right decision. Walzer and others who tell the dirty-hands
story always go one way: they always say, ‘The deep moral
constraint is overridden by the necessity.’ If they had
couched it more in terms of a dilemma, I’d be happier: but
they always favour the governmental or state decision—and
that disturbs me.

NW: Given that the ticking bomb scenario is pretty far-fetched, do we
ever get real situations where the problem of dirty hands does arise?

TC: The sort of cases that look as though they’re the most
plausible candidates for dirty hands are what I call cases for
extrication morality. These are situations where there is an
ongoing wrong that the politician has inherited. It may be an
unjust war that’s been waged by a predecessor. The politician
has decided it’s wrong and should stop. But immediately
stopping it would be disastrous for all sorts of innocent
parties. So, perhaps the right extrication strategy is to con-
tinue with this moral wrong for some short time, under the
governance of the idea that it is actually morally wrong, and
we’ve got to do something to extricate from it.

One of the criticisms of the Walzerian position is that it’s
too static. It makes it seem as though there’s this horrible
wrong that necessarily must be done by the ruler, and that’s
it; whereas I think that if it were true that a horrible wrong
had to be done, then it would be terribly important to start
looking around for changing the circumstances, for changing
the institutional background, so that it didn’t happen again
or was less likely to occur. It ought to be an ongoing moral
enterprise, in other words. One ought not just to throw up
one’s hands and say, ‘Oh, we’re politicians, we get dirty
hands.’

The extrication case makes that a little bit clearer because
what’s to be done is governed by the consideration that this is
a deep wrong. I’ve got to stop doing it, but maybe the way I
stop doing it is something that commits me to doing more
wrong. Take an imaginary President Obama early in his period
of office: suppose he thinks that the Afghan War is profoundly
wrong; he hasn’t told anybody yet, and it’s getting worse; and
the soldiers are saying, ‘You must put more troops in.’ Now,
he’s got a real problem. Let’s suppose he wants to stop the
war. He’s got to have popular support behind him to do this;
he’s got to get the generals on side too. So maybe he’s got to
do what he thinks is actually wrong, and keep the war going
for a bit longer, before ending it, which means a lot of people
are going to die while it continues.

Such cases might be genuine dirty-hands cases. But the
ticking bomb scenario—‘Oh, the school is going to be blown up
by the terrorist and I’ve got this fellow, and I know for certain
that he knows where the bomb is, and I know for certain that
he’ll succumb to the torture, and I know for certain that
he won’t mislead me long enough for the bomb to go off
somewhere else’—there are all these insane hypothetical
aspects to the story. There’s something corrupting about the
way people focus on such examples.

NW: I’d imagine somebody who said, ‘Look, these exceptional
circumstances allow me to torture somebody’, might be more prone to
make that move faster in the future.

TC: I think people can be corrupted by engaging in evil with
the best of intentions, and they can be corrupted by endless
consideration of these things. There’s a certain kind of
exercise in philosophy, unfortunately, which then leaks out
into the wider world. You imagine all these bizarre and
extreme circumstances in which people do the most hideous
and horrible things. Now, I don’t think this means one
of the philosophers is immediately prone to torturing
some passer-by, but there’s a corruption of the intellectual
environment that can go with this, which can help promote
rather awful things.

NW: In a previous interview, we talked to Raimond Gaita about
torture. He said that even to consider the possibility of torture is to have
taken a morally significant step in a bad direction.

TC: Yes, I have sympathy with that. There is something
dangerous in the political climate that influences the way
many intellectuals have fallen in behind the torture brigade,
and produced these arguments—some of them of the dirty-
hands kind, some of them just consequentialist—to provide a
moral rationale for this practice which we know is operating
not in supreme emergencies, but in all sorts of situations. That’s
pretty alarming. I don’t think it can be considered a purely
intellectual exercise to go around saying people can torture a
child because of some perceived political ‘necessity’.

NW: So should we wash our hands of dirty hands?

TC: If you say you want to wash your hands of something,
you’re always put in the same boat as Pontius Pilate, and
I don’t want to be in that category! People sometimes say, ‘Oh,
you’re worried about your soul’, and all this stuff. Well, yes,
I think you ought to worry about your soul. I don’t mean your
‘soul’ as an abstract object—and whether it gets to heaven or
not—but rather what sets of significant dispositions you have
towards action. I think people ought to be careful about
getting too deeply into the dirty-hands business. Walzer
himself seems to have become more cautious about the
category of dirty hands in his more recent writings. He
says for instance, ‘As hard cases make bad law, so supreme
emergencies put morality at risk. We need to be careful.’

NW: Does that then mean that we shouldn’t be electing politicians
who use dirty-hands rhetoric?

TC: Well, unfortunately we don’t always know what kind of
politicians we’re electing. But I think we should aim to elect
politicians who are skilled at political craft, and have good
character, and can be trusted to do good things. Walzer says
that we want political leaders who will get their hands dirty
when the time comes—I don’t think we do. If the time comes,
and it really is a situation that calls for dirty hands, then the
guy will have to make up his or her mind, but it shouldn’t be
done, as it were, in advance.
