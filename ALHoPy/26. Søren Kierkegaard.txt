Life’s Sacrifices
Søren Kierkegaard

Abraham has a message from God. It is a truly awful one: he
must sacrifice his only son, Isaac. Abraham is in emotional
torment. He loves his son, but he is also a devout man
and knows he has to obey God. In this story from Genesis in
the Old Testament, Abraham takes his son up to the top of a
mountain, Mount Moriah, ties him to a stone altar and is about
to kill him with a knife, as God has instructed. At the very last
second, though, God sends an angel who stops the slaughter.
Instead, Abraham sacrifices a ram that is caught in some bushes
nearby. God rewards Abraham’s loyalty by allowing his son
to live.

This is a story with a message. The moral is usually thought
to be, ‘Have faith, do what God tells you to do and everything
will turn out for the best.’ The point is not to doubt God’s word.
But for the Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard (1813–55), it
wasn’t quite so simple. In his book Fear and Trembling (1842) he
tried to imagine what must have gone through Abraham’s mind,
the questions, fears and anguish as he made the three-day
journey from his home to the mountain where he believed he
would have to kill Isaac.

Kierkegaard was quite odd and didn’t fit in easily in
Copenhagen where he lived. During the day this small thin man
was often seen walking around the city deep in conversation
with a companion and liked to think of himself as the Danish
Socrates. He wrote in the evening – standing up in front of his
desk surrounded by candles. One of his quirks was to show up
at the interval of a play so that everyone thought he’d been out
enjoying himself when he’d really not watched the play at all but
had been busy at home writing for most of it. He worked very
hard as a writer, but he had an agonizing choice to make in his
personal life.

He had fallen in love with a young woman, Regine Olsen, and
had asked her to marry him. She had agreed. But he worried
that he was too gloomy and too religious to marry anyone.
Perhaps he would live up to his family name ‘Kierkegaard’,
which means ‘graveyard’ in Danish. He wrote to Regine telling
her he couldn’t marry her and returned his engagement ring.
He felt terrible about his decision and spent many nights crying
in bed after that. She, understandably, was devastated and
begged him to come back. Kierkegaard refused. It is no coinci-
dence that after that most of his writing was about choosing
how to live and the difficulty of knowing that your decision is
the right one.

Decision-making is built into the title of his most famous
work: Either/Or. This book gives the reader a choice between
either a life of pleasure and chasing after beauty or one based on
conventional moral rules, a choice between the aesthetic and
the ethical. But a theme he kept returning to throughout his
writing was faith in God. The story of Abraham is at the heart
of that. For Kierkegaard, it is not a simple decision to believe in
God, but one that requires a kind of leap into the dark, a deci-
sion taken in faith that may even go against conventional ideas
of what you should do.

If Abraham had gone ahead and killed his son he would have
done something morally wrong. A father has a basic duty to
look after his son, and certainly shouldn’t tie him to an altar and
cut his throat in a religious ritual. What God asked Abraham
to do was to ignore morality and make a leap of faith. In
the Bible Abraham is presented as admirable for ignoring this
normal sense of right and wrong and being ready to sacrifice
Isaac. But couldn’t he have made a terrible mistake? What if
the message wasn’t really from God? Perhaps it was a hallucina-
tion; perhaps Abraham was insane and hearing voices. How
could he know for sure? If he had known in advance that God
wouldn’t follow through on his command, it would have been
easy for Abraham. But as he raised that knife ready to shed his
son’s blood, he really believed that he was going to kill him.
That, as the Bible describes the scene, is the point. His faith is so
impressive because he put his trust in God rather than in
conventional ethical considerations. It wouldn’t have been faith
otherwise. Faith involves risk. But it is also irrational: not based
on reason.

Kierkegaard believed that sometimes ordinary social duties,
such as that a father should always protect his son, are not the
highest values there can be. The duty to obey God trumps the
duty to be a good father, and indeed any other duty. From a
human perspective, Abraham might seem hard-hearted and
immoral for even considering sacrificing his son. But it is as if
God’s command is an ace of trumps that wins the game, what-
ever it is that God commands. There is no higher card in the
pack, and so human ethics are no longer relevant. Yet the
person who abandons ethics in favour of faith makes an
agonizing decision, risking everything, not knowing what
benefit there could possibly be from doing so, or what will
happen; not knowing for sure that the message is truly from
God. Those who choose this path are totally alone.

Kierkegaard was a Christian, though he hated the Danish
Church and couldn’t accept the way complacent Christians
around him behaved. For him, religion was a heart-wrenching
option, not a cosy excuse for a song in church. In his opinion
the Danish Church distorted Christianity and wasn’t truly
Christian. Not surprisingly, this didn’t make him popular. Like
Socrates, he ruffled the feathers of those around him who didn’t
like his criticisms and pointed remarks.

So far in this chapter I’ve written confidently about what
Kierkegaard believed. But interpreting what he really meant in
any of his books isn’t easy. This was no accident. He is a writer
who invites you to think for yourself. He rarely wrote under
his own name, but instead used pseudonyms. For example,
he wrote Fear and Trembling under the name Johannes de
Silentio – John of Silence. This wasn’t just a disguise to prevent
people discovering that Kierkegaard had written the books –
many people guessed who the author was straight away, which
is probably what he wanted. The invented authors of his books
are, rather, characters with their own way of looking at the
world. This is one of Kierkegaard’s techniques for getting you to
understand the positions he is discussing and encouraging you
to be engaged as you read. You see the world through that char-
acter’s eyes and are left to make up your own mind about the
value of their different approaches to life.

Reading Kierkegaard’s writing is almost like reading a
novel and he often uses fictional narrative to develop ideas.
In, Either/Or (1843), the imaginary editor of the book, Victor
Eremita, describes finding a manuscript in a secret drawer in a
second-hand desk. The manuscript is the main text of the book.
It has supposedly been written by two different people – he
describes them as A and B. The first is a pleasure-seeker whose
life revolves around his avoidance of boredom by seeking new
thrills. He tells the story of the seduction of a young woman
in the form of a diary that reads like a short story and mirrors
in some ways Kierkegaard’s relationship with Regine. The
pleasure-seeker, though, unlike Kierkegaard, is only interested
in his own feelings. The second part of Either/Or is written as if
by a judge who makes the case for a moral way of life. The style
of the first part reflects A’s interests: it consists of short pieces
about art, opera and seduction. It’s as if the author can’t keep his
mind on any one topic for long. The second half is written in a
more sober and long-winded style that reflects the judge’s
outlook on life.

In case you are feeling sorry for poor jilted Regine Olsen, by
the way, after her difficult on–off relationship with Kierkegaard
she married a civil servant and seems to have been happy
enough for the rest of her life. Kierkegaard, however, never
married, never even had a girlfriend after their break-up. She
really was his true love and their failed relationship was the
source of almost everything that he wrote in his short and
tormented life.

Like many philosophers, Kierkegaard wasn’t fully appreciated
during his brief lifetime – he died aged only 42. In the
twentieth century, however, his books became popular with
existentialists such as Jean-Paul Sartre (see Chapter 33)
who were particularly taken with his ideas about the anguish
of choosing what to do in the absence of pre-existing
guidelines.

For Kierkegaard, the subjective point of view, the experience
of the individual making choices, was all-important. Karl Marx
took a broader view. Like Hegel, he had a grand vision of how
history was unfolding and of the forces driving it. Unlike
Kierkegaard, he saw no hope whatsoever of salvation through
religion.
