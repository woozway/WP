Place Your Bets
Blaise Pascal

If you toss a coin it can come up heads or tails. There is a 50/50
chance of either, unless the coin has a bias. So it doesn’t really
matter which side you bet on as it is just as likely each time you
toss the coin that heads will come up as tails. If you aren’t sure
whether or not God exists, what should you do? Is it like tossing
a coin? Should you gamble on God not existing, and live your
life as you please? Or would it be more rational to act as if God
does exist, even if the odds on this being true are very long?
Blaise Pascal (1623–62), who did believe in God, thought hard
about this question.

Pascal was a devout Catholic. But unlike many Christians
today, he had an extremely bleak view of humanity. He was a
pessimist. Everywhere he saw evidence of the Fall, the imper-
fections we have which he thought were due to Adam and Eve
betraying God’s trust by eating the apple from the Tree of
Knowledge. Like Augustine (see Chapter 6), he believed that
human beings are driven by sexual desire, are unreliable and
easily bored. Everyone is wretched. Everyone is torn between
anxiety and despair. We should realize how insignificant we all
are. The short time that we are on earth is, in relation to the
eternity both before and after our lives, almost meaningless. We
each occupy a tiny space in the infinite space of the universe.
Yet, at the same time, Pascal believed that humanity has some
potential if we don’t lose sight of God. We are somewhere
between beasts and angels, but probably quite a lot closer to the
beasts in most cases and for most of the time.

Pascal’s best-known book, his Pensées (‘Thoughts’), was
pieced together from fragments of his writing and published in
1670 after his early death at the age of 39. It is written in a series
of beautifully crafted short paragraphs. No one is completely
sure how he intended the parts to fit together, but the main
point of the book is clear: it is a defence of his version of
Christianity. Pascal hadn’t finished the book when he died. The
order of the parts is based on how he had arranged pieces of
paper into bundles tied with string. Each bundle forms a section
in the published book.

Pascal was a sickly child, and not physically strong at any
time in his life. In painted portraits, he doesn’t ever look well.
His watery eyes gaze out sadly at you. But he achieved a great
deal in a short time. As a young man, encouraged by his father,
he became a scientist, working on ideas about vacuums and
designing barometers. In 1642 he invented a mechanical calcu-
lating machine that could add and subtract by using a stylus to
turn dials attached to complicated gears. He made it to help his
father with his business calculations. About the size of a shoebox,
it was known as the Pascaline and although a bit clunky, it
worked. The main problem was that it was very expensive to
produce.

As well as being a scientist and inventor, Pascal was a superb
mathematician. His most original mathematical ideas were
about probability. But it is as a religious philosopher and writer
that he will be remembered. Not that he would have liked
to have been called a philosopher: his writings include many
comments about how little philosophers know, and how
unimportant their ideas are. He thought of himself as a
theologian.

Pascal switched from work in mathematics and science to
writing about religion as a young man after he had been
converted to a controversial religious sect known as Jansenism.
The Jansenists believed in predestination, the idea that we don’t
have free will, and that only a few people had already been pre-
selected by God to go to heaven. They also believed in a very
strict way of life. Pascal once scolded his sister when he saw her
cuddling her child because he disapproved of displays of
emotion. His last years were spent living like a monk, and
although in great pain from the illness that eventually killed
him, he managed to carry on writing.

René Descartes (the subject of Chapter 11) – like Pascal, a
devout Christian, a scientist and a mathematician – believed
that you could prove God’s existence by logic. Pascal thought
otherwise. For him, belief in God was about the heart and
faith. He wasn’t persuaded by the sorts of reasoning about God’s
existence that philosophers generally use. He wasn’t, for
example, convinced that you could see evidence of God’s hand
in nature. For him, the heart, not the brain, was the organ that
leads us to God.

Despite this, in his Pensées he came up with a clever argu-
ment to persuade those who are unsure whether or not God
exists that they should believe in God, an argument that has
come to be known as Pascal’s Wager. It draws on his interest in
probability. If you are a rational gambler, rather than just an
addict, you’ll want to have the best chance of winning a big
prize, but you’ll also want to minimize your losses wherever
possible. Gamblers calculate odds and, in principle, bet accord-
ingly. So what does that mean when it comes to betting on God’s
existence?

Assuming you aren’t sure whether or not God exists, there are
a number of options. You can choose to live your life as if God
definitely doesn’t exist. If you are right, then you will have lived
without any illusion about a possible afterlife, and so you will
have avoided agonizing about the possibility that you are too
much of a sinner to end up in heaven. You also won't have
wasted time in church praying to a non-existent being. But that
approach, though it has some obvious benefits, carries with it a
huge risk. If you don’t believe in God, but God does actually
turn out to exist, not only might you lose your chance of bliss in
heaven, but you might end up in hell where you will be tortured
for the whole of eternity. That is the worst imaginable outcome
for anybody.

Alternatively, Pascal suggests, you can choose to live your life
as if God does exist. You can say prayers, attend church, read the
Bible. If it turns out that God does indeed exist, you win the best
possible prize: the serious chance of eternal bliss. If you choose
to believe in God, but it turns out that you are wrong, you won’t
have made a substantial sacrifice (and presumably, you won’t be
around after your death to learn that you were wrong and feel
bad about all that wasted time and effort). As Pascal put it, ‘If
you win you win everything; if you lose you lose nothing.’ He
recognized that you might miss out on ‘those poisonous pleas-
ures’: glory and luxury. But instead you’ll be faithful, honest,
humble, grateful, generous, a good friend, and will always tell
the truth. Not everyone would see it quite in these terms. Pascal
was probably so immersed in a religious way of life that
he didn’t realize that it would be a sacrifice for many non-
religious people to devote their lives to religion and live a life
of illusion, as they would see it. Nevertheless, as Pascal points
out, on one side you have the chance of eternal bliss if you are
right, and relatively minor inconveniences and a few illusions
if you are wrong. On the other side, you risk the chance of
hell, but your possible gains don’t compare with an eternity in
heaven.

You can’t really sit on the fence on the issue of whether or not
God exists, either. From Pascal’s point of view, if you try to do
this it could produce the same outcome for you as believing that
God definitely doesn’t exist: you could end up in hell, or at least
won’t get access to heaven. You have to make a decision one way
or the other. You really don’t know if God exists. What should
you do?

Pascal thought it was obvious. If you are a rational gambler
and look at the odds with a cool gaze you will see that you
should bet on God existing even if, as with tossing the coin,
there is only a small chance of being correct. The potential prize
is infinite, and the potential loss not great. No rational person
would do anything else but gamble on God existing with those
odds, he thought. Obviously there is a risk that you bet on God
and lose: that God turns out not to exist. But that’s a risk you
should take.

But what if you see the logic of this, but still don’t feel in your
heart that God exists? It’s really difficult (and perhaps impos-
sible) to talk yourself into believing something which you
suspect just isn’t true. Try believing there are fairies in your
wardrobe. You might be able to imagine that, but that’s very
different from really thinking there are fairies in there. We
believe things that we think are true. That’s just the nature
of belief. So how does the non-believer who doubts God’s
existence get to have faith in God?

Pascal had an answer to this problem. Once you’ve worked
out that it is in your best interests to believe in God, then you
need to find a way of convincing yourself that God does exist
and to have faith. What you should do is imitate people who
already believe in God. Spend time in church doing the things
that they do there. Take the holy water, have masses said and so
on. Very soon you’ll end up not just imitating their actions, but
actually having the beliefs and feelings they do, he thought.
That’s your best chance of winning eternal life and avoiding the
risk of eternal torture.

Not everyone finds Pascal’s argument at all convincing. One
of the most obvious problems with it is that God, if he exists,
might not look very favourably on people who only believed
in him because it was the safest bet. It seems like the wrong sort
of reason to believe in God. It’s just too self-interested because
it is based entirely on you selfishly wanting to save your own
soul at all costs. One risk might be that God would make
sure that no one who used this gambler’s argument ever got
into heaven.

Another serious problem with Pascal’s Wager is that it doesn’t
take into account the possibility that in following it you might
have opted for the wrong religion, the wrong God. Pascal
presents the option as between faith in a Christian God or
believing that there is no God. But there are many other reli-
gions that promise everlasting bliss to believers. If one of those
religions proves to be true, then by opting for following
Christianity the individual who follows Pascal’s Wager might
cut him or herself off from infinite happiness in heaven as
surely as the person who rejects all belief in God would have
done. Had Pascal thought about this possibility, he might,
perhaps, have been even more pessimistic about the human
condition than he was.

Pascal believed in the God described in the Bible; Baruch
Spinoza had a very different view of the deity, one that led some
to suspect he was an atheist in disguise.
