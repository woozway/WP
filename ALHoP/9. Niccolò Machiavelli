The Fox and the Lion
Niccolò Machiavelli

Imagine you are a prince ruling a city-state such as Florence or
Naples in sixteenth-century Italy. You have absolute power. You
can issue an order and it will be obeyed. If you want to throw
someone into jail because he has spoken out against you, or
because you suspect him of plotting to kill you, you can do that.
You have troops ready to do whatever you tell them. But you are
surrounded by other city-states run by ambitious rulers who
would love to conquer your territory. How should you behave?
Should you be honest, keep your promises, always act with
kindness, think the best of people?

Niccolò Machiavelli (1469–1527) thought that would prob-
ably be a bad idea, though you might want to seem honest and
seem good in that sense. According to him, sometimes it is
better to tell lies, break your promises and even murder your
enemies. A prince needn’t worry about keeping his word. As he
put it, an effective prince has to ‘learn how not to be good’. The
most important thing was to stay in power, and just about any
way of doing that was acceptable. Not surprisingly, The Prince,
the book in which he spells all this out, has been notorious ever
since it was published in 1532. Some people have described it as
evil or at best a handbook for gangsters; others think it the most
accurate account ever written of what actually happens in poli-
tics. Many politicians today read it, though only some will
admit this, perhaps revealing that they are putting its principles
into practice.

The Prince wasn’t meant to be a guidebook for everyone, only
for those who had recently come to power. Machiavelli wrote it
while living on a farm about seven miles south of Florence.
Sixteenth-century Italy was a dangerous place. Machiavelli had
been born and brought up in Florence. As a young man he was
appointed as a diplomat, and he had met several kings, an
emperor and the Pope in his travels across Europe. He didn’t
think much of them. The only leader who really impressed him
was Cesare Borgia, a ruthless man, the illegitimate son of Pope
Alexander VI, who thought nothing of tricking his enemies and
murdering them as he took control over a large part of Italy. As
far as Machiavelli was concerned, Borgia did everything right,
but was defeated by bad luck. He fell ill just at the point when
he was attacked. Bad luck played a large part in Machiavelli’s life
too and it was a topic he thought hard about.

When the immensely rich Medici family, who had previously
ruled Florence, returned to power, they threw Machiavelli into
prison, claiming that he had been part of a plot to overthrow
them. Machiavelli survived torture and was released. Some of
his colleagues were executed. But his punishment, because he
hadn’t confessed to anything, was to be banished. He couldn’t
return to the city he loved. He was cut off from the world of
politics. There, in the country, he would spend his evenings
imagining conversations with the great thinkers of the past. In
his imagination they discussed with him the best way to keep
power as a leader. He probably wrote The Prince to impress
those in power and as an attempt to get a job as a political
advisor. That would have allowed him to return to Florence and
the excitement and dangers of real politics. But the plan didn’t
work. Machiavelli ended up being a writer. As well as The
Prince, he wrote several other books about politics and was a
successful playwright – his play Mandragola is still sometimes
performed.

So what exactly did Machiavelli advise and why has this so
shocked most of his readers? His key idea was that a prince
needed to have what he called virtù. This is the Italian word for
‘manliness’ or valour. What does that mean? Machiavelli
believed that success depends quite a lot on good luck. Half of
what happens to us is down to chance and half is a result of our
choices, he thought. But he also believed that you can improve
your odds of success by acting bravely and swiftly. Just because
luck plays such a large part in our lives, it doesn’t mean that we
have to behave like victims. A river might flood, and that’s
something we can’t prevent, but if we have built dams and flood
defences we stand a better chance of surviving. In other words,
a leader who prepares well and seizes the moment when it
comes is more likely to do well than one who doesn’t.

Machiavelli was determined that his philosophy should be
rooted in what really happens. He showed his readers what he
meant through a series of examples from recent history, mostly
involving people he’d met. When, for example, Cesare Borgia
discovered that the Orsini family were planning to overthrow
him, Borgia managed to make them feel confident that he knew
nothing. He tricked their leaders into coming to talk with him
in a place called Sinigaglia. When they arrived, he had them all
murdered. Machiavelli approved of this trick. It seemed to him
a good example of virtù.

Again, when Borgia took control of the region called Romagna
he put a particularly cruel commander Remirro de Orco in
charge. De Orco terrified the people of Romagna into obeying
him. But once Romagna had calmed down, Borgia wanted to
distance himself from de Orco’s cruelty. So he had him murdered,
and left his body cut into two pieces in the city square for
everyone to see. Machiavelli approved of this gruesome treat-
ment. It achieved what Borgia wanted, which was to keep the
people of Romagna on his side. They were glad that de Orco
was dead, but at the same time they realized that Borgia must
have ordered his murder and this would have scared them. If
Borgia was capable of that sort of violence against his own
commander, none of them was safe. So Borgia’s action was
manly, in Machiavelli’s eyes: it displayed virtù and was just the
sort of thing a sensible prince should do.

This sounds as if Machiavelli approved of murder. He obvi-
ously did in some circumstances if the results justified it. But that
wasn’t the point of the examples. What he was trying to show was
that Borgia’s behaviour in killing his enemies, and in making an
example of his own commander de Orco, worked. It produced
the desired effects and prevented further bloodshed. Through his
swift, cruel action, Borgia stayed in power and prevented the
people of Romagna rising against him. For Machiavelli, this end
result was more important than how it was achieved: Borgia was
a good prince because he wasn’t squeamish about doing what was
necessary to keep in power. Machiavelli wouldn’t have approved
of pointless murder, killing just for the sake of it; but the murders
he described weren’t like that. Acting with compassion in those
circumstances, Machiavelli believed, would have been disastrous:
bad both for Borgia, and for the state.

Machiavelli stresses that it’s better as a leader to be feared
than to be loved. Ideally you would be both loved and feared,
but that’s hard to achieve. If you rely on your people loving you,
then you risk them abandoning you when times get tough. If
they fear you, they will be too scared to betray you. This is part
of his cynicism, his low view of human nature. He thought that
human beings were unreliable, greedy and dishonest. If you are
to be a successful ruler, then you need to know this. It’s
dangerous to trust anyone to keep their promises unless they
are terrified of the consequences of not keeping them.

If you can achieve what you are aiming for by showing kind-
ness, keeping your promises, and being loved, then you should
do this (or at least appear to do it). But if you can’t, then you
need to combine these human qualities with animal ones. Other
philosophers emphasized that leaders should rely on their
humane qualities, but Machiavelli thought that at times the
effective leader would have to act like a beast. The animals to
learn from were the fox and the lion. The fox is cunning and can
spot traps, but the lion is immensely strong and terrifying. It is
no good being like the lion all the time, acting simply by brute
force, as that will leave you at risk of falling into a trap. Nor can
you just be a wily fox: you need the strength of the lion occa-
sionally to keep you safe. But if you rely on your own kindness
and sense of justice, you won’t last long. Fortunately, people are
gullible. They are taken in by appearances. So, as a leader, you
may be able to get away with seeming to be honest and kind
while breaking your promises and acting cruelly.

Now you’ve read this, you are probably thinking that Machiavelli
was simply an evil man. Many people do believe that, and the
adjective ‘machiavellian’ is widely used as an insult to refer to
someone who is prepared to scheme and use people to get their
own way. But other philosophers believe Machiavelli expressed
something important. Perhaps ordinary good behaviour doesn’t
work for leaders. It is one thing to be kind in everyday life and to
trust people who make promises to you, but if you have to lead a
state or a country, trusting other countries to behave well towards
you may be a very dangerous policy. In 1938 the British Prime
Minister Neville Chamberlain believed Adolf Hitler when he
gave his word that he would not try and expand German territory
further. That now looks naïve and foolish. Machiavelli would
have pointed out to Chamberlain that Hitler had every reason to
lie to him and that he shouldn’t trust him.

On the other hand, we shouldn’t forget that Machiavelli
supported acts of extreme brutality against potential enemies.
Even in the bloody world of sixteenth-century Italy, his open
approval of Cesare Borgia’s behaviour seemed shocking. Many
of us think there should be strict limits to what a leader can do
to his or her worst enemies, and that these limits should be set
by law. If limits aren’t set, we end up with savage tyrants. Adolf
Hitler, Pol Pot, Idi Amin, Saddam Hussein and Robert Mugabe
all used the same sorts of techniques as Cesare Borgia to stay in
power. Not exactly a good advertisement for Machiavelli’s
philosophy.

Machiavelli saw himself as a realist, someone who recognized
that people are fundamentally selfish. Thomas Hobbes shared
that view: it underpins his whole account of how he thought
society ought to be structured.
