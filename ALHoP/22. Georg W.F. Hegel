The Owl of Minerva
Georg W.F. Hegel

‘The owl of Minerva flies only at dusk.’ This was the view of
Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831). But what does it
mean? Actually, that question ‘What does it mean?’ is one that
readers of Hegel’s works ask themselves a lot. His writing is
fiendishly difficult, partly because, like Kant’s, it is mostly
expressed in very abstract language and often uses terms that he
has himself invented. No one, perhaps not even Hegel, has
understood all of it. The statement about the owl is one of the
easier parts to decipher. This is his way of telling us that wisdom
and understanding in the course of human history will only
come fully at a late stage, when we’re looking back on what has
already happened, like someone looking back on the events of a
day as night falls.

Minerva was the Roman goddess of wisdom, and she was
usually associated with the wise owl. Whether Hegel was wise
or foolish is much debated, but he was certainly influential. His
view that history would unfold in a particular way inspired Karl
Marx (see Chapter 27) and so certainly changed what happened,
since Marx’s ideas stirred revolutions in Europe in the early
twentieth century. But Hegel also irritated many philosophers.
Some philosophers even treated his work as an example of the
risk of using terms imprecisely. Bertrand Russell (see Chapter
31) came to despise it, and A.J. Ayer (see Chapter 32) declared
that most of Hegel’s sentences expressed nothing at all. For Ayer,
Hegel’s writing was no more informative than nonsense verse
and considerably less appealing. Others, including Peter Singer
(see Chapter 40), have found great depth in his thought, and
argue that his writing is difficult because the ideas he is strug-
gling with are so original and hard to grasp.

Hegel was born in Stuttgart, in what is now Germany, in 1770
and grew up in the era of the French Revolution when the
monarchy there was overthrown and a new republic estab-
lished. He called it ‘a glorious dawn’ and with his fellow students
planted a tree to commemorate the events. This time of political
instability and radical transformation influenced him for the
rest of his life. There was a real sense that fundamental assump-
tions could be overturned, that what seemed to be fixed for all
time needn’t be. One insight this led to was the way in which the
ideas that we have are directly related to the time we live in
and can’t be fully understood outside their historical context.
Hegel believed that in his own lifetime a crucial stage in history
had been reached. On a personal level he progressed from
obscurity to fame. He began his working life as a private tutor
to a wealthy family before moving on to be a headmaster of
a school. Eventually he was made a professor at the university
in Berlin. Some of his books were originally lecture notes
written up to help his students understand his philosophy. By
the time of his death he was the best-known and most admired
philosopher of his time. This is quite amazing, given how diffi-
cult his writing can be. But a group of enthusiastic students
dedicated themselves to understanding and discussing what he
taught and bringing out both the political and metaphysical
implications.

Heavily influenced by Immanuel Kant’s metaphysics (see
Chapter 19), Hegel came to reject Kant’s view that noumenal
reality lies beyond the phenomenal world. Rather than accepting
that noumena lie beyond perception causing our experience, he
concluded that the mind shaping reality just is reality. There is
nothing beyond it. But this did not mean that reality remained
in a fixed state. For Hegel, everything is in a process of change,
and that change takes the form of a gradual increase in self-
awareness, our state of self-awareness being fixed by the period
in which we live.

Think of the whole of history as a long bit of paper folded up
on itself. We can’t really understand what is there until it has all
been unfolded. Nor can we know what is written on the very last
bit of paper until it is opened out. There is an underlying struc-
ture to the way it unfolds. For Hegel, reality is constantly
moving towards its goal of understanding itself. History isn’t in
any sense random. It’s going somewhere. When we look back
over it we will see that it had to unfold like this. This is a strange
idea when you first hear it. I suspect most people reading this
won’t share Hegel’s view. History for most of us is closer to how
Henry Ford described it: ‘just one damned thing after another’.
It is a series of things that happen without any overall plan. We
can study history and discover the probable causes of events
and predict something of what might happen in the future. But
that doesn’t mean it has an inevitable pattern in the way Hegel
thought it did. It doesn’t mean it’s going somewhere. And it
certainly doesn’t mean it is gradually becoming aware of itself.

Hegel’s study of history wasn’t a separate activity from his
philosophy, it was part of it: the main part of it. History and
philosophy were entwined for him. And everything was driving
towards something better. This wasn’t an original idea. Religions
usually explain history as leading to some end point, such as
Christ’s Second Coming. Hegel was a Christian, but his account
was far from orthodox. For him, the final result wasn’t the
Second Coming. For Hegel, history has an end target, one that
no one had really appreciated before. It’s the gradual and inevi-
table coming to self-awareness of Spirit through the march of
reason.

But what is Spirit? And what does it mean for it to become
self-aware? The word for Spirit in German is Geist. Scholars
disagree about its precise meaning; some prefer to translate it as
‘Mind’. Hegel seems to mean by it something like the single
mind of all humanity. Hegel was an idealist – he thought that
this Spirit or Mind was fundamental and finds its expression in
the physical world (in contrast, materialists believe that physical
matter is basic). Hegel retold the history of the world in terms
of gradual increases in individual freedom. We are moving from
individual freedom, via freedom for some people but not
others, towards a world in which everyone is free in a political
state that allows them to contribute to that society.

One way he thought that we make progress in thought is by
a clash between an idea and its opposite. Hegel believed that we
can move closer to truth by following his dialectical method.
First someone puts forward an idea – a thesis. This is then met
with its contradiction, a view that challenges the first idea – its
antithesis. From this clash of two positions, a more complex
third position emerges, which takes account of both – a synthesis
of the two. And then, more often than not, this starts the
process again. The new synthesis becomes a thesis, and an
antithesis is put against it. All this keeps going until full self-
understanding by Spirit occurs.

The main thrust of history turns out to be Spirit under-
standing its own freedom. Hegel traced this progress from those
who lived under tyrannical rulers in Ancient China and India,
who did not know that they were free, through to his own time.
For these ‘Orientals’, only the supremely powerful ruler experi-
enced freedom. In Hegel’s view, the ordinary people had no
awareness at all of freedom. The Ancient Persians were little
more sophisticated in their appreciation of freedom. They were
defeated by the Greeks, and this brought progress. The Greeks
and later the Romans were more aware of freedom than those
who went before them. Yet they still kept slaves. This showed
that they didn’t fully appreciate that humanity as a whole should
be free, not just the wealthy or the powerful. In a famous
passage in his book The Phenomenology of Spirit (1807), he
discussed the struggle between a master and a slave. The master
wants to be recognized as a self-conscious individual and needs
the slave in order to achieve this: but without acknowledging
that the slave merits recognition too. This unequal relationship
leads to a struggle, with one dying. But this is self-defeating.
Eventually master and slave come to recognize their need for
each other, and the need to respect each other’s freedom.

But, Hegel claimed, it was only with Christianity, which trig-
gered an awareness of spiritual value, that genuine freedom
became possible. In his own time history realized its goal. Spirit
became aware of its own freedom and society was as a result
ordered by principles of reason. This was very important to him:
true freedom only arose from a properly organized society. What
worries many readers of Hegel is that in the sort of ideal society
imagined by Hegel those who don’t fit in with the powerful
organizers’ view of society will, in the name of freedom, be forced
to accept this ‘rational’ way of living. They will, in Rousseau’s
paradoxical phrase, be ‘forced to be free’ (see Chapter 18).

The end result of all history turned out to be Hegel himself
coming to an awareness of the structure of reality. He seemed to
think he had achieved that in the final pages of one of his books.
That was the point at which Spirit first understood itself. Like Plato
(see Chapter 1), then, Hegel gave a special position to philoso -
phers. Plato, you’ll remember, believed that philosopher-kings
should rule his ideal republic. Hegel, in contrast, thought philoso-
phers could achieve a particular kind of self-understanding that
was also an understanding of reality and of all history, another way
of enacting the words engraved at the Temple of Apollo in Delphi:
‘Know Thyself’. It is philosophers, he believed, who come to realize
the ultimate unfolding pattern of human events. They appreciate
the way that the dialectic has produced a gradual awakening.
Suddenly everything becomes clear to them and the point of the
whole of human history becomes obvious. Spirit enters a new
phase of self-understanding. That’s the theory anyway.

Hegel had many admirers, but Arthur Schopenhauer was not
one of them. He thought Hegel wasn’t really a philosopher at all
because he lacked seriousness and honesty in the way he
approached the subject. As far as Schopenhauer was concerned,
Hegel’s philosophy was nonsense. Hegel, for his part, described
Schopenhauer as ‘loathsome and ignorant’.
