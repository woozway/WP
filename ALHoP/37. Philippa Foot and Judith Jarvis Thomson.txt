The Runaway Train and the Unwanted Violinist
Philippa Foot and Judith Jarvis Thomson

You are out for a walk one day and see a runaway train hurtling
down the tracks towards five workers. The driver is uncon-
scious, possibly as the result of a heart attack. If nothing is done,
all will die. The train will squash them. It’s travelling much too
fast for them to get out of the way. There is, however, one hope.
There is a fork in the tracks just before the five men, and on the
other line there is only one worker. You are close enough to
the points to flick the switch and make the train veer away
from the five and kill the single worker. Is killing this innocent
man the right thing to do? In terms of numbers it clearly is: you
save five people by killing just one. That must maximize happi-
ness. To most people this seems the right thing to do. In real life
it would be very difficult to flick that switch and watch someone
die as a result, but it would be even worse to hold back and
watch five times as many people die.

This is a version of a thought experiment originally created by
the British philosopher Philippa Foot (1920–2010). She was
interested in why saving the five people on the track was accept-
able, but some other cases of sacrificing one to save many weren’t.
Imagine a healthy person walking into a hospital ward. In the
ward are five people who desperately need various organs. If one
doesn’t get a heart transplant she will certainly die. Another needs
a liver, one a kidney, and so on. Would it be acceptable to kill the
healthy patient and slice up the body to provide the organs for the
unhealthy ones? Hardly. No one believes that it would be accept-
able to kill the one healthy person, remove his heart, lungs, liver,
kidneys, and implant them in the five. Yet that is a case of sacri-
ficing one to save five. What’s the difference between that and the
runaway train?

A thought experiment is an imaginary situation designed to
bring out our feelings, or what philosophers call ‘intuitions’, on
a particular issue. Philosophers use them a lot. Thought experi-
ments allow us to focus more closely on what is at stake. Here
the philosophical question is, ‘When is it acceptable to sacrifice
one life to save more?’ The story about the runaway carriage
allows us to think about this. It isolates the key factors and
shows us whether or not we feel that such an action is wrong.

Some people say you should never flick the switch in this
example because that would be ‘playing God’: deciding who
should die and who should live. Most people, however, think
you should.

But imagine a related case. The American philosopher Judith
Jarvis Thomson thought up this version of the original problem.
The runaway train this time is on a straight piece of track
running towards the five unfortunate workers who will certainly
be killed unless you do something. You are standing on a bridge,
and next to you is a very large man. If you push him over the
bridge, he is heavy enough to slow down and stop the train
before it hits the five workers. Assuming you have the strength
to push this man over in front of the train, should you do it?

Many people find this a tougher case, and are more inclined
to say ‘no’, despite the fact that in both this case and in the case
of the fork in the line and the points that you can switch the
consequence of your actions is the death of one person rather
than five. In fact, pushing the large man off the bridge looks
very like murder. If the consequences are the same in the two
cases then there shouldn’t be an issue. If it is right to flick the
switch in the first example, it must surely be right to push the
large man in front of the train in the second. This is puzzling.

If the imaginary situation of pushing someone over a bridge
suggests physical difficulties, or you are put off by the brutality
of having to wrestle the man to his death, the case can be revised
so that there is a trapdoor on the bridge. Using the same kind of
lever as you do in the first case with the point-switching, you
can drop the large man into the path of the train with minimal
effort. You just flick a lever. Many people see this as morally far
removed from the fork in the line case. Why should this be so?

The so-called Law of Double Effect is one explanation of why
we think the forking track case and the fat man case are
different. This is the belief that it can be all right, for example,
to hit someone so hard that they die but only if your intention
is to defend yourself and a lighter blow wouldn’t protect you.
Predictable bad side effects of an action with a good intention
(in this case saving yourself) can be acceptable, but deliberate
harm is not. It isn’t right to go out and poison someone who is
planning to kill you. The first case is one in which you have an
acceptable intention, it’s just that following through on it will
result in someone’s death. In the second case you intend to kill
the person, and that isn’t acceptable. For some people, this
solves the problem. Other people think this principle of Double
Effect is a mistake.

These cases may seem far-fetched and nothing to do with
everyday life. In one sense that is true. They’re not meant to be
real cases. These are thought experiments designed to clarify
our beliefs. But from time to time real-life situations do arise
that lead to similar decisions. For example, during the Second
World War the Nazis were firing flying bombs into parts of
London. A German spy had become a double agent. The British
had the chance to send misleading information back to the
Germans, telling them that the rockets were falling far to the
north of their intended targets. This would have had the effect
of making the Germans change their aim, so that instead of
falling on heavily populated parts of London, the rockets would
fall further to the south on people in Kent and Surrey. In other
words, there was a possibility of giving information that would
cause fewer people to be killed. In this case the British decided
not to play God.

In a different sort of real-life situation, the participants did
decide to take action. In the Zeebrugge disaster in 1987, when a
car ferry sank and dozens of passengers were struggling to get
out of the icy sea, a young man climbing to safety on a rope
ladder froze with fear and could not move. He stayed in that
position for at least ten minutes, stopping anyone else from
getting out of the sea. If they didn’t get out quickly they would
drown or die of cold. Eventually those in the water pulled him
off the ladder and managed to escape to safety. The young man
fell into the sea and drowned. The decision to pull the young
man off the ladder must have been an agonizing one to make,
but in these extreme circumstances, as with the runaway train,
sacrificing one person to save many was probably the right
thing to do.

Philosophers are still arguing about the train example and
how it should be solved. They’re also arguing about another
thought experiment that Judith Jarvis Thomson (born 1929)
came up with. This one was to show that a woman who had
used contraception but who had still become pregnant did
not have a moral duty to go through with having the baby. She
could have an abortion without doing something morally
wrong. To have the baby in such circumstances would be an act
of charity, but not a duty. Traditionally, debates about the
morality of abortion had focused on the foetus’ point of view.
Her argument was important in that it gave a lot of weight to the
woman’s perspective. Here’s the example.

There is a famous violinist who has a kidney problem. His
only chance of survival is to be plugged into a person who
shares his very rare blood group. You have that same blood
group. One morning you wake up to find that while you were
asleep doctors have attached him to your kidneys. Thomson
argues that in such a situation you don’t have a duty to keep him
plugged into you, even though you know that he will die if you
pull the tubes out. In the same way, she suggests, if a woman is
pregnant even though she used contraception, the developing
foetus inside her does not have an automatic right to the use of
her body. The foetus is like the violinist.

Before Thomson introduced this example, many people
thought that the crucial question was, ‘Is a foetus a person?’
They believed that if they could show that a foetus was a
person, then abortion would obviously be immoral in every
case. Thomson’s thought experiment suggested that even if the
foetus is a person, that doesn’t settle the question.

Of course, not everyone agrees with this answer. Some people
still think that you shouldn’t play God even if you wake up with
a violinist plugged into your kidneys. It would be a difficult life,
unless you really loved violin music. But it would still be wrong
to kill the violinist even though you had not chosen to help him.
Likewise, plenty of people believe that you should never delib-
erately terminate a healthy pregnancy even if you did not intend
to get pregnant and took precautions against doing so. What the
cleverly constructed thought experiment does, though, is bring
out the principles underlying these disagreements.

The political philosopher John Rawls also used a thought
experiment, in his case to investigate the nature of justice and
the best principles for organizing society.
