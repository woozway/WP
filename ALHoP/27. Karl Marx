Workers of the World Unite
Karl Marx

In the nineteenth century there were thousands of cotton mills
in the north of England. Dark smoke poured from their tall
chimneys, polluting the streets and covering everything in soot.
Inside men, women and children worked very long hours –
often 14-hour days – to keep the spinning machines going.
They weren’t quite slaves, but their wages were very low, and the
conditions were tough and often dangerous. If they lost concen-
tration they could get caught up in the machinery and lose
limbs or even be killed. Medical treatment in these circum-
stances was basic. They had little choice, though: if they didn’t
work they would starve. If they walked away, they might not
find another job. People who worked in these conditions didn’t
live long, and there were very few moments in their lives they
could call their own.

Meanwhile the owners of the mills grew rich. Their main
concern was making a profit. They owned capital (money they
could put to use to make more money); they owned the build-
ings and the machinery; and they more or less owned the
workers. The workers had next to nothing. All they could do
was sell their ability to work and help the mill owners grow rich.
By their labour they added value to the raw materials that the
mill owners bought. When the cotton came into the factory it
was worth much less than it was when it left. But that added
value mostly went to the owners when they sold the product. As
for the workers, the factory owners paid them as little as
possible – often just what would keep them alive. The workers
had no job security. If demand for whatever they were making
declined, they were sacked and left to die if they couldn’t
find more work. When the German philosopher Karl Marx
(1818–83) began writing in the 1830s these were the grim
conditions that the Industrial Revolution had produced not just
in England, but all over Europe. It made him angry.

Marx was an egalitarian: he thought human beings should be
treated equally. But in the capitalist system those who had
money – often from inherited wealth – got richer and richer.
Meanwhile those who had nothing but their labour to sell lived
wretched lives and were exploited. For Marx, the whole of
human history could be explained as a class struggle: the
struggle between the rich capitalist class (the bourgeoisie) and
the working class or proletariat. This relationship stopped
human beings achieving their potential and turned work into
something painful rather than a fulfilling kind of activity.

Marx, a man of immense energy and with a reputation for
causing trouble, spent most of his life in poverty, moving from
Germany to Paris, then Brussels to avoid persecution. Eventually
he made his home in London. There he lived with his seven
children, his wife Jenny, and a housekeeper Helene Demuth
with whom he had an illegitimate child. His friend Friedrich
Engels helped him find work writing for newspapers and even
adopted Marx’s illegitimate son to help him save face. But the
Marx family rarely had enough money. They were often sick,
hungry and cold. Tragically, three of his children died before
reaching adulthood.

In later life, most days Marx would walk to the Reading
Room at the British Museum in London and study and write, or
else stay at home in his crowded Soho flat and dictate to his wife
because his own handwriting was so bad that sometimes even
he couldn’t read it. In these difficult conditions he produced a
huge number of books and articles – they fill more than fifty
thick volumes. His ideas have changed the lives of millions of
people, some for the better, and many, undoubtedly, for the
worse. At the time, though, he must have seemed an eccentric
figure, perhaps a little crazy. Few people could have foreseen
how influential he would be.

Marx identified with the workers. The whole structure of
society ground them down. They couldn’t live fully as human
beings. Factory owners very soon realized that they could make
more goods if they broke the production process down into
small tasks. Each worker could then specialize in a particular
job on the production line. But this made the workers’ lives even
more tedious as they were forced to perform boring, repetitive
actions over and over again. They didn’t see the whole process
of production and they barely earned enough to feed them-
selves. Instead of being creative, they were worn down and
turned into cogs in a huge piece of machinery that was there
just to make the factory owners richer. It was as if they weren’t
really human beings at all – just stomachs that needed to be fed
to keep the production line going and the capitalists extracting
more profit: what Marx called the surplus value created by the
workers’ labour.

The effect on the workers of all this was what Marx labelled
alienation. He meant several things by this word. The workers
were alienated or distanced from what they truly were as human
beings. The things they made alienated them too. The harder
the workers worked and the more they produced, the more
profit they made for the capitalists. The objects themselves
seemed to take revenge on the workers.

But there was some hope for these people even though their
lives were miserable and completely mapped out by economic
circumstances. Marx believed that capitalism would in the end
destroy itself. The proletariat was destined to take over in a
violent revolution. Eventually from all this bloodshed a better
world would emerge, one in which people were no longer
exploited, but could be creative and co-operate with each other.
Each person would contribute whatever they could to society,
and society in turn would provide for them: ‘from each according
to his ability, to each according to his need’ was Marx’s vision.
By taking control of factories, the workers would make sure that
there was enough for everyone to have what they needed. No
one need go hungry or without suitable clothing or shelter. This
future was communism, a world based on sharing the benefits
of co-operation.

Marx believed that his study of the way society develops
revealed that this future was inevitable. It was built into the
structure of history. But it could be helped along a bit, and in the
Communist Manifesto of 1848, which he wrote with Engels, he
called upon workers of the world to unite and overthrow capi-
talism. Echoing the opening lines of Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s
Social Contract (see Chapter 18), they declared that the workers
had nothing to lose but their chains.

Marx’s ideas about history were influenced by Hegel (the
subject of Chapter 22). Hegel, as we have seen, declared that
there is an underlying structure to everything, and that we are
gradually progressing to a world that will somehow be conscious
of itself. Marx took from Hegel the sense that progress is inevi-
table, and that history has a pattern and is not just one thing
after another. But in Marx’s version, progress occurs because of
the underlying economic forces.

In place of the class struggle Marx and Engels promised a
world in which no one would own land, where there was no
inheritance, where education was free, and where public facto-
ries provided for everyone. There would be no need for religion
or morality either. Religion, he famously declared, was ‘the
opium of the people’: it was like a drug keeping them in a sleepy
state so they didn’t realize their true oppressed condition. In the
new world after the revolution human beings would achieve
their humanity. Their work would be meaningful and they
would co-operate in ways that benefited everyone. Revolution
was the way to achieve all this – and this meant violence, since
the rich were unlikely to give up their wealth without a struggle.

Marx felt that philosophers of the past had only described the
world, whereas he wanted to change it. This was a little unfair
to earlier philosophers, many of whom had brought about
moral and political reform. But his ideas had more effect than
most. They were contagious, inspiring real revolutions in Russia
in 1917 and elsewhere. Unfortunately the Soviet Union – the
huge state that emerged, embracing Russia and some of its
neighbours – together with most other communist states created
in the twentieth century on Marxist lines, proved oppressive,
inefficient and corrupt. Organizing the processes of production
on a national scale was far harder than might be imagined.
Marxists claim that this doesn’t damage Marxist ideas them-
selves – some still believe that Marx was basically right about
society, it’s just that those who ran the communist states didn’t
run them on truly communist lines. Others point out that
human nature makes us more competitive and greedy for
ourselves than he allowed: there is no possibility in their view of
human beings co-operating fully in a communist state – we’re
just not like that.

When he died of tuberculosis in 1883, few people could have
foreseen Marx’s impact on later history. It looked as if his ideas
would be buried with him in London’s Highgate Cemetery.
Engels’ declaration at the graveside that ‘His name will endure
through the ages, and so also will his work!’ seemed like wishful
thinking.

Marx’s main interest was in economic relationships since in
his view they shape everything that we are and can become.
William James, a pragmatist philosopher, meant something quite
different when he wrote about the ‘cash value’ of an idea – for
him, that was simply what action the idea led to, what difference
it made in the world.
