MICHAEL SANDEL ON
Sport and Enhancement

David Edmonds: The science of genetics is advancing faster than our
moral intuitions can cope. No longer are so-called ‘Designer Babies’ just
a figment of the imagination, restricted to the realm of sci-fi movies.
The implications are huge—and not just for babies and reproduction.
We can modify our genetic make-up as adults too. Take sport: in theory
we can now manipulate genes to make athletes run faster, jump higher,
throw further. Does that mean sport will evolve into a form of competi-
tion between quasi-robots? And if so, would it matter? The distinguished
and genetically unmodified Harvard philosopher Michael Sandel
believes that we should be extremely cautious in our attempts to shape
and master nature, and indeed to master our shape.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we’re going to focus on is genetic
enhancement, specifically enhancement in the area of sport. Could you
sketch the kinds of enhancements that are possible now and some that
will be possible in the near future using genetic techniques?

Michael Sandel: As far as sports are concerned, we hear a
lot about blood doping and the use of steroids for perfor-
mance enhancement in athletes. In the not-distant future
it will be possible to use various forms of gene therapy, for
example, to enhance muscle, and that I think is what in the
area of sport will raise the most difficult questions.

NW: Could you give us some general pointers as to why you’re against
enhancement?

MS: I should first clarify that I’m in favour of the use of
biotechnology for medical purposes for the sake of health.
So, for example, vaccination—vaccination against smallpox,
for example—enhances the immune system. I’m all for that,
because it promotes health. So any use of new genetic
technologies to repair injury or to cure or prevent disease
I’m all in favour of.
What I’ve criticized is the use of bio-medical technologies
not for medical purposes but for non-medical enhancements:
for performance enhancement in athletes, to try to select the
genetic traits of children, to try to enhance memory, to
enhance height, let’s say among children—who may be
perfectly healthy but want to be taller, or their parents want
them to be taller—sex selection: these are the kinds of
non-medical uses of genetic engineering that I’ve criticized.

NW: Quite central to your discussion here is the difference between a
cure for something which is a deficiency and an enhancement that takes
us beyond what’s normal.

MS: Yes, and I’ll quickly acknowledge that there can be
hard cases, right at the boundary. What about braces for
orthodontia, for example? Is that related to health or is it
merely cosmetic; is it just to improve one’s bite or is it to fit
a certain look that’s become widespread in our society?
That would be an example of a hard case. But the underlying
difference between a cure and a non-medical enhancement
requires a normative idea of health and of human flourish-
ing. Health is about restoring or preserving normal human
faculties which are a constitutive ingredient but a very
limited part of the good life.

NW: In sport, enhancement is the name of the game. That’s what
most athletes want to do: to enhance performance. And they’re prepared
to do anything within the law, and often things which are pushing at the
edge or going beyond the law. How could you persuade an athlete that
they shouldn’t be using enhancement?

MS: There are two obvious arguments. One is safety:
steroids, for example, have long-term medical risks. A second
familiar reason is fairness. If there is a general ban in the
Olympics on various forms of enhancement or blood doping
or various forms of muscle enhancement, then if some use it
surreptitiously or illicitly it puts the others at a disadvantage.
But safety and fairness are not the only reasons to oppose
genetic enhancement in sport.

NW: In your book The Case Against Perfection you use the
example of Tiger Woods, who allegedly had his eyesight dramatically
improved from myopia to very good vision by laser technology. Now that
seems to be perfectly acceptable: he could have worn glasses and
achieved a similar sort of effect. Why is that alright, but an enhance-
ment beyond that not?

MS: Besides safety and fairness, my main objection to the
use of performance-enhancing genetic therapies, for exam-
ple, has to do with the worry that it will corrupt sport and
athletic competition as a place where we admire the cultiva-
tion and display of natural gifts. It will distance us from the
human dimension of sport.
If you imagine a future where it’s possible to engineer a
bionic athlete, let’s say in baseball, which is my favourite
sport, who could hit every pitch for a home run of 600 feet.
It would maybe be an amusing spectacle, but it wouldn’t be
a sport. We might admire the pharmacist or the engineer,
but would we admire the athlete? We would lose contact
with the human dimension and the display of natural human
gifts that I think is essential to what we admire and appre-
ciate in sports.

NW: You could have a superb hitter, but what about a superb pitcher?
And if you got those two together it seems to me that genetic enhance-
ment would produce a wonderful sport. Just as with soccer, if you had a
team in which every player was as good as Pelé, that would be wonder-
ful to watch.

MS: Would it? If we knew that all of the players were bionic
athletes; robots, in effect, if you take it to the extreme? We
might find it amusing to see robots or machines perform
great athletic feats, but would we even consider them athletic
feats or human athletic feats? There are technology-laden
sports like auto-racing. I’ve never understood the appeal of
auto-racing myself, but I think what makes it a sport or a
game but not an athletic endeavour is that it’s mainly the
machines that we’re watching, not the human excellence.

NW: Well, take marathon running; that’s a paradigm case of competi-
tive athleticism. Any major athlete now who’s a serious marathon
runner will use all kinds of technological means to enhance their
performance, and that doesn’t detract from the sport. It’s amazing to
watch these people. People running sub-five-minute miles over and over
again are almost a different species to me, but it’s still wonderful to
watch.

MS: But we would still want to know what sort of training
was enabling them to do that. And isn’t there a difference
between great training and ingesting a drug or going in for
some kind of genetic therapy? Here’s an extreme way of
testing your idea about the marathon. It’s true that new
technologies do sometimes make for a better race; but that’s
because they bring out more fully the skills and the excel-
lences that the best athletes display.
Once marathon runners ran barefoot. And then along
came someone and invented a running-shoe. Some might
have said that that corrupts the race. I think that’s an
enhancement that actually perfects rather than corrupts the
race because it enables the race to be a better test of who’s the
best runner, removing contingencies like stepping on a sharp
pebble.
Take another extreme case. In the Boston marathon some
years ago the winner crossed the line first, was given her
prize, but then it was discovered that she had used a rather
unusual means of enhancement. After she got to the
starting-line she hopped in the subway and rode it most of
the way, got out, and ran across the finish-line. Now what is
the difference between the running-shoe and the subway?
Both are technologies that enhance the ability to create the
race, but one of them corrupts the purpose of the sport. And
that’s the test we should use with new technologies.

NW: I think there’s an easy answer there, because the constitutive
rules don’t allow you to go on the subway; there’s no rule on the
running-shoes you can use, but there is on the mode of transport—apart
from the shoes.

MS: Appealing to the constitutive rules, if by that you mean
the rules that happen to be set down by the governing body
of the sport, won’t be sufficient to answer the normative
question—because we have to think about it from the
standpoint of the people who are setting the rules. The
Olympic Committee is trying to decide whether to permit
runners and skiers to use a special oxygen chamber that
runners might sleep in. The chamber enriches the red blood
cells to enable the blood cells to carry more oxygen. The
effect is the same as taking EPO, which is a hormone that
increases the ability of the blood to carry oxygen, or blood
doping. Both of these practices are illegal. So the question is:
‘What should the rules be? Which technologies should the
laws allow?’ And for that we can’t just appeal to the law.

NW: Your argument relies on some idea of what is natural, and I’d
like to hear what makes something natural. Because on one reading
anything that a human being does is natural.

MS: Right. And one could argue that the inventiveness that
leads to the inventions of these biotechnologies is itself a
natural human pursuit. That’s true. My argument against
enhancement, whether in the sports context or whether
we’re talking about creating designer children, is not to
valorize or to sanctify nature as such. There are lots of things
that are bad in nature: polio, for instance, or malaria. I’m all
in favour of using biotechnology to banish those facts of
nature. So the conception that I need to explain, what it is
that troubles us about enhancement, has to do with the
appreciation of the gifted character of human powers and
talents and achievements: that not everything about us is at
our disposal subject to our desire to master or dominate or
manipulate nature. There is a certain hubris when human
beings overreach and try to exert dominion over all of
nature, including human nature. So I’m more worried about
the human dispositions and the hubris that lies behind the
drive to perfect our nature than I am concerned to sanctify
or protect nature as such.

NW: That notion of giftedness seems to imply somebody giving, and
the obvious candidate is God. God ‘gives us’ certain natural attributes
and it’s for us to understand and develop those. But why would an
atheist or an agnostic take your view on this seriously?

MS: It’s a very good question. I want to make the case that
the ethic of giftedness can be supported by various religious
views that see God as the giver, but that is not the only way
of making sense of the idea of giftedness. We commonly
speak of the athlete’s ‘gift’ or the musician’s ‘gift’, without
necessarily attributing that gift to God. All the ethic of
giftedness requires is an awareness, an appreciation, that not
everything about us is the product of our own will, our own
creation. It points to the moral importance of a certain
attitude of restraint, even humility, in the face of what’s
been given to us. Some would say we should exercise that
humility because to do otherwise would be to play God.
But I think that humility in the face of the given can also be
understood in secular terms.

NW: And in the book you use three kinds of arguments against those
who think we should master anything that we can master.

MS: Yes. I think that three important features of our moral
landscape would be transformed if we really did come to
think of ourselves as, and were, wholly self-made men and
women. We would lose a certain capacity for humility and
restraint, not only with respect to our own natural talents
but especially with respect to our children. It’s an important
fact about children that they are not wholly the product of
their parents’ will or the instrument of their ambitions. So
humility is very much at stake here.
Also there would be an explosion of responsibility if
people were held responsible for everything about them.
It’s morally redeeming and morally important that we
aren’t morally responsible for everything about us, and for
that matter for everything that our children are or will
become.
Finally, the moral basis of solidarity would be eroded if we
came to think of ourselves as wholly self-made and wholly
self-sufficient.

NW: What then would you say to a child who, knowing you had
sufficient funds and there was available technology, said: ‘Dad I really,
really wanted to be good at sport and you’re the only one who wouldn’t
give me that and you could have done it’?

MS: I would say: ‘Go out and practise a bit longer.’

NW: And the child would say: ‘Practice isn’t going to get me beyond
all these genetically enhanced school colleagues I’ve got. I’m always
going to be last in the race and that’s your responsibility.’

MS: Well, I would invite my child to ask himself or herself
whether those genetically re-mastered or souped-up school-
mates weren’t missing an important part of the purpose of
sports, and maybe even the joy of the competition. I’d point
out that some of the joy and some of the pride of success
would be diminished if it were the product of a pill or
tweaking of the genes.

NW: In sport this is a losing battle, because sportspeople all over the
world are already using every enhancement they can possibly find. Do
you think the world is worse for that?

MS: I think the world is and will be the worse insofar as the
cumulative effect of technological enhancement and genetic
enhancement will be a slide from sport to spectacle. Some
people suggest that we should let the two exist side-by-side:
have races where there are no holds barred, where all
technologies are permitted, souped-up athletes, and so on;
and have a second race for free-range slowpokes, and see
which commands a greater audience. That’s the challenge
that’s made by defenders of enhancement.
I think that in the short-run people might flood to the
spectacle to see the robotic athletes. However, in time the
audience would wane because spectacle exerts a certain
allure, but only for a time; because it swamps or diminishes
and erodes the human element, the nuance, the subtlety, the
complexity of human beings negotiating with the limits of
their own capacities. So I think the ratings would rise for a
time, but then fade.
