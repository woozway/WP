ALEXANDER NEHAMAS ON
Friendship

David Edmonds: What special duties and obligations do we have
towards our friends that we don’t have towards strangers? Friendship
plays a central part in most people’s lives, and Alexander Nehamas, a
distinguished professor of philosophy at Princeton, argues that it’s a
subject deserving of close philosophical scrutiny.

Nigel Warburton: We’re going to talk about friendship. How did
you become interested in the topic?

Alexander Nehamas: Friendship is an extraordinarily
important relationship in almost everybody’s life, but,
strangely enough, modern and contemporary philosophy
have not paid much attention to it. So I thought that it was
worth thinking about it in some detail—to see what contri-
butions it makes to life and whether we can explain its
significance in the life of most, if not all, of us.

NW: Why do you think it has been neglected as a topic of discussion
for philosophers?

AN: Well, I think that a major reason is the following. Since
the Enlightenment, and particularly in the last seventy-five
years or so, we have had a tendency to identify all values
with moral values. By moral values I mean values that enjoin
us to treat everybody equally, to give the same respect and
the same consideration to everyone in the world, independ-
ently of their status, race, gender, class, and everything else
of that sort. Now, what is essential to friendship is precisely
that you don’t treat everybody equally; you give preference
to your friends—you treat your friends better than you treat
other people, you have more duties and obligations to them.
And if you think that all value is moral and that to be a good
friend is to neglect moral value, the best thing you can do
may well be to neglect friendship as a subject of philosophi-
cal interest instead. Otherwise you may have to end up
thinking that friendship is immoral and therefore a bad
thing—something which obviously it is not. At least, that
way you avoid confronting that dilemma.

NW: Are you suggesting, then, that friendship is neutral from a moral
point of view?

AN: In the end, I hope to be able to say that friendship is
profoundly valuable without locating its value in morality. In
fact, it is not just valuable, but absolutely necessary to us—it
is difficult to live without it. But its value is not the value
attaching to moral behaviour. A whole other set of values, to
which philosophy has paid no attention, is involved in
friendship, values which I believe are also central to the arts.
To put it very bluntly, and very roughly, the values of
morality are values that depend on our commonalities: the
similarities we already share and the similarities we hope to
create among us. The values of friendship and the arts are
exactly the opposite: they are values that depend on our
differences from one another, on everything that makes one
a distinct and interesting individual, someone with a
particular and recognizable character or style. I believe that
both kinds of value, the values of commonality and the
values of individuality, are absolutely crucial in life. But I
worry that we have paid too much attention to the values of
commonality and I think that it is time to bring the other
sort into view again.

NW: I think it is important, then, to distinguish your use of ‘friend’
from a more common one, where it just means acquaintance.

AN: The word ‘friend’ is very general. We can have very
casual friends, very close lifelong friends, and everything in
between. Of course, our most casual friends, who are no
more than acquaintances, play a very limited role in our
lives. Close friends, though, are absolutely essential to the
development of our character and personality, and the role of
people in between is, unsurprisingly, in between. But when
you put all these relationships together, their effect, ideally, is
to help constitute a person that is not only distinctive, but
interestingly so. That ‘interestingly’, though, is unfortu-
nately where the difficulties are.

NW: That seems to put a lot of who we are outside our individual
control. We can’t choose completely the people we meet; and to some
extent we can’t even choose who our friends are, because we need them
to like us as well as us liking them.

AN: It is often said that friendship is a purely free and
voluntary relationship. But of course it is not; it depends on
all sorts of accidents and contingencies. Every one of us is to
a great extent the product of factors over which we have no
control. To take my own case, for example, I had no control
over being born in Greece, over who my parents were, over
the school they sent me to, over the fact that the school
assigned me to a particular dormitory, which in turn limited
the range of people who would become my friends, and so
on. But for me freedom is less the ability to have chosen
differently (which philosophers as different as Plotinus and
Nietzsche actually take to reveal the very absence of free-
dom) than the willingness to recognize myself in what I have
done, the ability to say: ‘That was my action.’ Accordingly,
freedom is not indicated so much by the fact that I chose to
do what I did but by the fact that it was I who chose it, of
my own initiative and not because of some external factor.
And that means that to regret my action is not to wish that
I had chosen to act differently—for all I know, that is not
possible—but to be disappointed in the sort of person my
action shows me to be.

NW: So one of the values of friendship is the way in which our friends
allow us to become who we wish to be.

AN: Our friends are even more important than that. They
not only allow us, they orient us toward what we are to be
and they are crucial to our becoming one kind of person
rather than another. Whether the person we end up becom-
ing is a person we wish to be or not is a separate question:
friendship is by no means an unalloyed good.

NW: People fall into friendships but they also fall out of them. Why do
they fall out of friendship?

AN: That can happen for many different reasons, but
perhaps we could classify them, very roughly, into two
kinds: either I have changed, or my friend has changed. At
least that is the way we put it. My own sense is that to
think that our friend has changed generally indicates that
we ourselves have changed as well—except that our own
changes are often invisible to us: we still seem to ourselves
to be who we have always been. So a friendship, generally
speaking, falls apart when the friends have gradually
begun to take different directions in their lives and can no
longer sustain the connection they had had up to that
point. It can be very painful to ‘fall out’ of friendship, as
you so well put it—no less painful than the end of a love
affair.
The reason it is so painful is, I think, that when you can no
longer be my friend you reveal, first, that you no longer like
the person I am—which shows that the question ‘What did I
do wrong?’ is always the wrong question to ask. For it is not
what I did but, as we put it in everyday terms, who I am, that
you no longer find attractive. Second, it reveals something
that is even more painful—namely, that you no longer like
the person you have become as a result of our friendship and
that you want to give up something that I have been at least
partly responsible for creating. And that shows that saying
‘it’s not you, it’s me’—more common, to be sure, in love
affairs but often said in friendships as well—is not a con-
solation but a simple evasion, for you are responsible for
the ‘I’ that is no longer satisfied with itself.

NW: An aspect of that is the way that people change over time;
friendship takes place over time, it is not just a relationship of the
moment.

AN: Taking place over time is absolutely crucial to friend-
ship; it is also a main reason why friendship is more difficult
to represent than we commonly think. It is close to impos-
sible, for example, to recognize that a painting depicts two
(or more) friends without a title to that effect or some similar
literary artifice or allusion. The reason is that friends can be
doing anything together and no single event is ever enough
to indicate the presence of friendship. Sexuality and violence
are relatively easy to represent because some of their visual
marks are generally known. But friendship has no marks that
are specific to it: even a painting of two people fighting could
be a painting of friendship, since friends often fight with each
other. Recognizing a friendship (even when it comes to
realizing that you are or have become someone’s friend)
requires time—time to develop in the first place and time to
flourish. As Aristotle says, you can’t become someone’s
friend overnight. And I would add that you can’t be some-
one’s friend for a day.

NW: Is that in part because to be a true friend to somebody involves
understanding them and to understand somebody you have to see them
in a range of situations?

AN: Exactly. Where others see only a particular action on
your part, your friend can see your whole personality
expressed in it. And to be capable of that, friends have to
have been exposed to a variety of each other’s actions.
The parallel with the arts is handy here. What is it to
recognize that a particular painting is by this painter rather
than by anyone else? It is to recognize that painter’s style,
and to be capable of that you must have seen a large enough
number of that painter’s works. In the same way, you have to
see a pattern in your friends’ actions—a pattern that is only
discernible with time. Seeing such a pattern is not so much
the ability to predict what your friends will do as it is the
ability to see what they do, once they have done it, as an
expression of their character—and, in fact, it is often in their
most unpredictable actions that their personality emerges
most forcefully.

NW: I can see the selfish value to me of having friends in that they
help me to understand who I am. But what is the overall value of
friendship?

AN: If you are selfish you won’t limit your friends’ value
to their contribution to your self-knowledge—you will also
value them for being free with their money when you need
it or with their getting you out of a difficult situation and
so on. And our ability to rely on our friends is an impor-
tant part of the value of friendship. But the good of
friendship as a whole lies in its contribution to our becom-
ing who we are and, in particular, to our becoming—if we
do—arresting individuals. Friendship, the totality of our
friends—among whom our close friends are the most
important—is one of the main instruments or mechanisms
that we employ in order to establish a path through life
that is distinctly our own. Friendship, in other words, can’t
be accommodated within the constraints of morality
because individuality is not always consonant with
morality. Friendship and art have a distinct value of their
own, dependent, as I said earlier, on individuation and
differentiation rather than on similarity and solidarity
with the rest of the world. But both are essential to life and
sometimes, for better or worse, they come into conflict.
And when they do, it is not clear to me that morality must
always win. Philosophers have very often supposed—
partly through the influence of Kant—that moral values
should always prevail and—partly through a moralized
reading of Aristotle’s discussion of philia1 —that they
always do. But I am not sure they should.

NW: Do you think that is because what we often value is the person,
and one or two good actions are not what make a good person?

AN: Well, people often get credit—and rightly so—for
particular actions: you don’t have to save lives more than
once to be admired for your heroism, just as sometimes an
author’s reputation rests on a single novel and nothing else.
In general, however, evaluation attaches primarily to the
person and only secondarily to actions. For one thing, two
actions can involve exactly the same kind of behaviour and
yet express completely different character traits: the very
same type of action can be in one context admirable and in
another, contemptible. That is what Socrates was always
insisting upon when he said, for example, that courage
can’t be defined as the willingness to stand your ground
against the enemy, because standing your ground can
sometimes be very foolish and, anyway, retreating in order
to counter-attack can also be the brave thing to do in
certain circumstances. It is not the behaviour that qualifies
as courageous but the psychological trait, the character
that is exhibited in it.
