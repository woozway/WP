METAPHYSICS AND MIND

A. W. MOORE ON
Infinity

David Edmonds: Can God cook a breakfast so big He can’t eat it?
That’s just one of the paradoxes thrown up by the troubling concept of
infinity. Professor A. W. Moore is at Oxford University: his knowledge of
the infinite knows no bounds.

Nigel Warburton: Now the topic we’re going to talk about is
infinity. What exactly is infinity?

A. W. Moore: There are two reasons why that’s a difficult
question right from the outset. One problem, or basic
paradox, that arises with infinity is that it arguably can’t be
defined—almost by definition.

The point about the infinite is that it resists being pinned
down, and if you’re trying to define the concept, then what
you’re trying to do is pin it down in some way, circumscribe it,
give it parameters. And a lot of people say: ‘Well, that’s exactly
what you can’t do with the infinite; you can’t define it.’

Then there’s another problem, which is not quite so
peculiar to infinity: it’s a problem that would arise with
defining a lot of philosophical concepts. It’s the problem that
there hasn’t been much of a consensus. If you look back over
the thousands of years that people have been discussing the
infinite, you’ll see that they’ve had very different views about
what it is. So if we were to venture some definition of the
infinite, we would automatically be taking sides in the
debate.

But one way of approaching it is to compare it with the
finite. How does infinity compare with finitude? The
answer, in some ways, is very basic. Anything that’s finite
can be contrasted with something else. It may be that we’re
talking about literal spatial finitude: for example, a physical
object which is finitely big, or which has certain spatial
parameters, such as a chair or a table. Precisely because it
occupies a certain fixed amount of space, it can be contrasted
with other things that are outside that space and that are
independent of it. So a contrast between the infinite and the
finite appears to be that the infinite doesn’t stand opposed to
anything else. The infinite embraces everything.

But once again, this means we’re dealing with a basic
paradox, because, on the one hand, the idea is that the
infinite doesn’t stand opposed to anything else—it is
all-inclusive—while on the other hand, precisely what that is,
is a way of contrasting the infinite with the finite. By
definition, you can’t contrast the infinite with the finite,
although that’s exactly what you want to do.

NW: Infinity crops up in different areas of thought. In school,
people encounter infinity in mathematics. Presumably
mathematicians have had to be reasonably precise about what they
mean by infinity.

AWM: You’re right; and for many people that is their first
encounter with the infinite. Think about ordinary whole
numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc., where the crucial thing is the ‘etc.’.
It’s not long before children arrive at the idea that this is a
sequence that can never end. However big a number you
think of, there’s always the possibility of thinking of an even
bigger number.

One of the ways in which mathematicians try to sharpen
this idea is with reference to yet more paradoxes. Suppose
that you’re interested in deciding whether one set of objects
is the same size as another set. For example, you might want
to know whether the number of people that live on your
street is the same as the number of dogs that there are on
your street. Now, one way of deciding that is to count them.
If you count the people living on your street, and it turns out
there are twenty-seven, and if you then count the dogs that
there are on your street, and it turns out there are twenty-
seven, lo and behold, there’s an answer to your question.
There is the same number of people as dogs.

But sometimes you can tell that two sets are the same
size without counting. You might not have the resources to
count. Suppose you go to some football match at which
there’s a huge crowd of people—too many to count—and
suppose you consider the question whether the number of
left legs in the stadium is the same as the number of right
legs. Assuming you know that there isn’t some unfortunate
person who’s missing a leg, you can immediately answer
that question without bothering to count. You don’t have
to work out how many legs there are. You know that
the number of left legs is the same as the number of right
legs, because they can be paired off with each other.
Corresponding to each left leg there’s that person’s right
leg, and vice versa.

That seems to be a basic way of comparing sets in size. But
if you think about what happens when you’re dealing with
infinite sets, again there’s a paradox. Suppose we think once
again about the positive whole numbers—1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
etc.—and suppose we also think specifically about the ones
that are even—2, 4, 6, 8, 10, etc. Now, on the face of it, we’re
inclined to say there are fewer even numbers than there are
numbers altogether. There are all those odd numbers as well!
And yet, going back to the example of left legs and right legs,
we can perform a similar sort of trick. We can pair off all the
numbers with those that are specifically even, in the obvious
way: 1 gets paired with 2, 2 gets paired with 4, 3 gets paired
with 6, and so on and so forth. It looks as if we have to say
that there are just as many even numbers as there are
numbers altogether, because they can be paired off in this
way. So it’s a paradox; it’s puzzling.

But rather than be fazed by this paradox, what mathemati-
cians do is put it to their advantage. This comes right back to
your original question, about how mathematicians clarify
the infinite. What mathematicians do is to use this paradox
as their way of explaining what the infinite is. They say that
a collection or set of objects is infinite precisely when this
sort of paradox arises. If you can pair off a sub-collection
with the whole collection in the way that we just have done,
that means you’re talking about an infinite collection of
objects.

NW: From a psychological point of view, this is mind-boggling. That’s
a common feature of the infinite. There’s a stage at which you start to
realize these paradoxes are all around you.

AWM: It is mind-boggling; there’s no doubt about it.
Psychologically, it’s very difficult to get your mind around
these things. Mathematicians try to take these paradoxes in
their stride. Philosophers and non-mathematicians tend to
be more puzzled. Let’s think about these numbers again. It’s
all very well a mathematician saying that it makes perfectly
good mathematical sense, but in non-mathematical terms it
really does seem to be puzzling. The German mathemati-
cian David Hilbert (1862–1943) used to lecture on these
topics, and would illustrate these paradoxes in a very
striking way. He imagined a hotel, which subsequently got
referred to as ‘Hilbert’s hotel’, which was unlike any normal
hotel in that it had infinitely many rooms in it. He would
ask his audience to imagine that one cold, dark, wet, windy
night somebody turns up, desperate for accommodation.
He’s not booked in. He’s hoping that he can get in at the last
moment; he’s hoping that there will be a spare room
available. And, to his intense disappointment, he finds out
that all the rooms in this hotel, even though it’s infinite, are
occupied. There are infinitely many guests who have
already checked in for the night.

He’s bitterly disappointed. But then the receptionist has a
brainwave. She says, ‘With a little bit of juggling, we may be
able to accommodate you after all.’ So she gets in touch with
all the guests. She says to the guest in Room 1, ‘Would you
mind transferring to Room 2?’ He says, ‘That’s fine.’ She says
to the guest in Room 2, ‘Would you mind transferring to
Room 3?’ He says, ‘No problem.’ And so on. Everybody
moves along one: because there are infinitely many rooms,
that’s possible. So everybody shifts along one, and they’re all
still accommodated. But Room 1 is now vacant and this
visitor can check in for the night!

NW: I can see that the concept of infinity throws up a number of fun
and intriguing puzzles and paradoxes—but why do you think we are so
interested in the infinite?

AWM: That is in many ways the crucial question. And the
answer has to do with something that you touched on right
at the beginning: the basic contrast between the infinite and
the finite, and in particular between the infinite and our own
finitude.

In all sorts of ways, we ourselves are finite. Obviously, we’re
physically finite: we only take up a finite amount of space.
Even more basically, we only take up a finite amount of time.
Each of us has a finite history, and there will come a time
when we don’t exist any longer. But in other, more metaphori-
cal ways we’re finite as well. We’re limited: we’re limited in
what we can do, and we’re limited in what we can know. I
think our fascination with the infinite comes from a vague
sense that there is something out there that contrasts with our
own finitude. We feel that we must be part of something
much bigger. We are constrained; we are limited. But what’s
out there—whatever form it may take, whatever it might be
like—is ultimately unconstrained, and unlimited. Even if it
turns out that the universe is physically finite, or even if it
turns out that space and time themselves are finite—which
is what a lot of physicists these days suggest—nevertheless
there remains this metaphorical sense in which there’s
something there which is unconditioned or unlimited, in stark
contrast to us.

The fascination with the infinite is part of that general
fascination that human beings have with their own place in
the wider scheme of things. How do we fit in? What is the
relationship between this little finite chunk of reality which
is me, and all the rest of it?

NW: And historically, most philosophers who got interested in the
infinite were talking not just about an abstract mathematical concept
but about the nature of God.

AWM: That’s right. The infinite has always been of
philosophical interest. Western philosophy, going right back
to the pre-Socratics, over 2,500 years ago, has always had a
fascination with the infinite. As you quite rightly say,
historically there’s been more emphasis on those more
metaphysical aspects of the infinite—in particular, as part of
a preoccupation with God—than the more mathematical
aspects that we were considering earlier.

NW: You’ve written a book that is probably the definitive work on
infinity. What conclusions did you come to?

AWM: Well, first of all, it’s very kind of you to describe my
book in that way. My own focus was largely historical. We
were just talking about how the concept has been of interest
in the history of philosophy, ever since its beginning. One of
the conclusions that I came to is that it is a fundamental
philosophical concept. It’s no accident that all the great
philosophers have had something to say about it. When
you’re thinking about the infinite, you’re thinking about
something very basic. It’s a supremely important philo-
sophical concept, but it’s also riddled with paradoxes, as
we’ve seen. One of the things I tried to do in that book was
to see how we could have our cake and eat it: continue to
acknowledge the importance of the infinite, on the one
hand, and on the other hand take seriously all the paradoxes
that afflict it and all the difficulties we confront when we try
to talk about it.
