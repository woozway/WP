METAPHYSICS AND MIND

HUGH MELLOR ON
Time

David Edmonds: I’m writing this cue now. In a couple of minutes I’ll
have finished it—my writing of it will have been done, past. Hopefully,
in the future, after you’ve read this introduction, you’ll be reading an
interview with Hugh Mellor, Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at
Cambridge University. Professor Mellor believes that ‘tense’—the past,
the present, the future—is not part of time per se. Your reading of this
introduction will precede your reading of the interview: things happen
earlier and later. But Professor Mellor argues time itself is not essentially
tensed. Confused? Hopefully, in ten minutes, you’ll be less so. Hugh
Mellor took time out to talk to Philosophy Bites.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we are focusing on today is time. It’s
quite easy to see why physicists would be interested in time and its
measurement, but why philosophers?

Hugh Mellor: Time has always posed problems that interest
philosophers, and indeed some physicists for philosophical
reasons: like whether it flows, and whether it’s something in
itself or just, so to speak, something that separates events
that happen one after the other. The relation between time
and space is another question that interests both physicists
and philosophers.

NW: To me that sounds almost like science: whether time flows
sounds like an empirical question.

HM: It sounds like an empirical question, but it really isn’t,
although it’s something physicists have occasionally taken for
granted. Isaac Newton took it for granted: he said that time
in itself flows equably without regard essentially to what
happens in it—so you could have time without anything in
it. But whether that’s so or not, it’s really a philosophical
question; it’s one on which Newton pursued a long contro-
versy with the German philosopher and mathematician
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.

NW: Your book Real Time, and its successor, Real Time II, both
deal with the question of tense. Could you say a little bit about what
tense is and how it relates to time?

HM: Tense, in its normal, non-philosophical usage, simply
refers to a variation in the form of verbs depending on
whether you’re talking about the past, the present, or the
future: something happened, something is happening,
something will happen. But as used by philosophers talking
about time, it doesn’t refer to the form of verbs, but to what
those verbs are used to discuss: namely past, present, and
future as different regions of time. That’s what we philoso-
phers mean by tense; it doesn’t matter to us whether those
regions are referred to using verbs or in some other way. The
issues tense raises arise from the fact that things and
events—like this interview—appear to move through time.
They start off by being future, which this interview was
yesterday, become present, as it is now, and then go on to
become past, which it will be in not too short a time.

NW: That seems quite a natural way of talking about time: we always
talk about the past, present, and the future. What’s the problem?

HM: The problem is that while things are past or present or
future, none of them stays there. Everything that starts off
future becomes present and then becomes past. Although
this sounds innocuous enough, in the last century people
have realized that it raises a serious problem. For one thing,
you don’t want to say that events change in respect of whether
they’re past, present, or future. Whatever this interview is
now must be how it was yesterday, or you’d get a contradic-
tion: I can’t be saying some things now and it be the case
yesterday that I would say something different. I might have
intended to say something different, but that’s another
matter: you don’t always do what you intend to do.

If I put money on a horse, for example, predicting it will
win, and it does win, the now-past fact of its winning must
be the same fact as the then-future fact that I put money on;
otherwise the bookie could refuse to pay! Whether events
are past, present, or future, they have got to be the same
events. The only way in which they can change is by ceasing
to be future by becoming first present and then past. That’s
quite different from things changing in any other way, like
first being hot and then being cold. The question is, how to
distinguish this special sort of change.

The best way to start is by noticing that this sort of change
has a spatial analogue. For example, at the moment you’re
not only in Cambridge, you’re also here, which is where I am.
This morning you were in Oxford and at that point you
weren’t here. But the facts of your being in Oxford at one
time, and then in Cambridge at a later time, must be the very
same facts. And this variation across space, from your being
there to your being here, is exactly analogous to the variation
in time, from this interview being future to its being present.
Yet we naturally think that variations over time differ
importantly from variations across space in a way that
reflects the nature of time itself. The difference is that things
flow through time, from future to present, in a way in which
things don’t (as it were) flow across space, from here to there.
The question is, why not and what’s the difference?

NW: So is it fair to say that your view is that tense is another way of
describing a relation between a person and an event, but the tense itself
doesn’t actually exist as part of time?

HM: The event exists as part of time, but you’re right in
saying that tense is a relation between a person and an event,
like this interview, and relations in general are not properties
of what they relate. For example, if, as I suspect, you’re taller
than me, that fact is not a property of either of us. You
yourself are a certain height; I myself am a certain height;
and your being taller than me isn’t a property of mine, or of
yours: it’s a relation between us. Similarly, if you say, ‘Here I
am in Cambridge’ now, that statement will be true. But what
makes it true isn’t that Cambridge or you have the property
of being here, but that you’re saying it in Cambridge.

In the same way, while it’s true to say ‘this interview is
happening now’, what makes it true is just that it’s said
during the interview. What makes statements like this true is
a relation between what you say—or think—and when you
say it. But this ‘when’, the time at which you say something,
isn’t in itself either present or past or future. The time just is,
just as Cambridge just is. Suppose, to pursue the spatial
analogy, you want to put ‘You are here’ signs on differently
located copies of a map of England. To make what those
signs say true, you must put them on correspondingly
different parts of that map. On a copy in Cambridge you
must make the sign point to the representation of Cam-
bridge, while on a copy of the same map in Oxford you must
make the sign point to a representation of Oxford. In other
words, the sign on a copy picks out a relation between that
copy and its location: namely, the relation of being at that
location. That’s what makes the Oxford and Cambridge signs
true, not that either Oxford or Cambridge has the property
of being here: there’s no such property. And so it is with time:
this interview doesn’t have the property of being now, that is,
of being present, which is acquired when the interview
started and will disappear when it ends. There’s no such
property: the interview simply occurs at a certain time on a
certain day. What makes it true to say, during the interview,
that it’s happening now is simply that this statement is made
during the interview.

NW: Why, then, do we talk in tense terms?

HM: We talk in tense terms because this relation I’ve been
talking about matters very much to when we act and what
we do. For example, if I decide to do something—pick
something up, or go and fetch something—I will do it at
whatever place I’m at or time I’m in. And that will make it
true to say or think, as I do it, that I’m doing it here and
doing it now. I don’t need to know where I am to know that
I’m doing it ‘here’, any more than I need to know the time at
which I do it, to know that I’m doing it ‘now’. It’s because
your ‘here’ and ‘now’ automatically follow you around, so to
speak, that you can know you’re acting in the ‘here and now’
without knowing whether you’re acting in Cambridge or
Oxford or at 10 or 11 a.m. And the reason it’s absolutely
indispensable to think about our actions in these terms is
that we have to think of them in a way that fits this relation
between our actions and when and where we do them, not
that they can only occur in places and times that, for some
reason, have these mysterious properties of being here and
being now.

NW: Your view, then, is that time is essentially tenseless: there’s
nothing about past, present, and future built into time?

HM: No, nothing about past, present, and future is built
into time. What is built into time is the difference between
earlier and later, which is the temporal analogue of spatial
differences like that between north and south, say. The
reason this temporal difference matters more than its spatial
analogue is that other things depend on it that don’t depend
on the spatial difference. For example, I can’t now decide to
do something yesterday, because causes, like my deciding to
do something, and effects, like my doing it, always precede
their effects in time. But they can occur in any direction in
space. As far as getting things done goes, there’s no funda-
mental direction to space. So, for example, while turning on
a light-bulb emits light in all directions (and indeed in none,
since it lights up the bulb itself), it only lights up things at
later times. That’s why the direction of time—the difference
between later and earlier—matters to us in practice. So when
we think of action in tense terms, as we do, we have to
distinguish what’s future—what’s later than when we’re
thinking about it—from what’s earlier—that is, from what
we correctly think of as past. That’s why these notions
matter to us. Only in philosophy is it important to realize
that, when we think in this way, we’re just reading out into
the world what are really just relations between us and
parts of it.

NW: Does it follow from that that you can’t go back into an earlier
time—so that time travel is somehow conceptually impossible?

HM: I think it does, though most of my professional
colleagues think it doesn’t—they think it is indeed possible to
travel back in time. Here I’m on the side of people who aren’t
philosophers—people who think you couldn’t go back in
time. Because if you could go back in time then you might,
for example, kill your grandmother before she has any
offspring, thereby making it impossible for you to exist to go
back in time in the first place. And while this argument
doesn’t persuade most philosophers, it does persuade me.

NW: Why do you think that these issues about time matter so much?

HM: I’m actually slightly puzzled about that, because I’m
not sure they do matter very much. They certainly don’t
matter in practical terms and I don’t think they matter in
scientific terms either. That is, our physics will be the same
whatever view we take about time. But many physicists
think for some reason that there’s a puzzle about time. They
are not willing to take whatever is measured by clocks, and
other devices for measuring time, as just another physical
variable like temperature, or indeed distance in space. So a
fairly recent issue of the New Scientist contained a very silly
piece—by someone whose name had better escape me!—
about the time ‘illusion’. And while there’s a long history of
respectable physicists and philosophers thinking that time is
an illusion, I don’t understand why physicists today take this
idea to be either new—for example, entailed by quantum
physics—or important.

I suspect the idea that time is an illusion arises from a
vague sense that there’s something odd about tense. And
indeed, if you think of tense as a feature of the world, that is
an illusion, as I’ve tried to show. What is not an illusion is
that we are in the world, and need to think about it, and
especially about how to act in it, in terms of tense. And the
fact that the world requires us to do this shows that time
itself—tenseless time, what makes events earlier and later
than each other—is indeed a real feature both of the world,
and of our experience of it. It’s true that not everyone agrees
with me about this, for reasons I reject but can at least
understand. What I can’t understand is why so many
intelligent people get so worked up about it: it’s on a par with
people who think that splitting infinitives is worse than
murdering your grandmother!
