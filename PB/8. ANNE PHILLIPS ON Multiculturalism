ANNE PHILLIPS ON
Multiculturalism

David Edmonds: The phenomenon of mass migration has made the
tension between liberalism and multiculturalism one of the most hotly
debated topics in contemporary political theory. Multiculturalists believe
that members of minority groups should have the right to lead their lives
as they see fit. But what happens when certain minority values clash
with the values of the majority? Professor Anne Phillips is at the London
School of Economics and is the author of several books on liberalism,
multiculturalism, and feminism.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we want to talk about is multicultural-
ism. What do you understand by the term?

Anne Phillips: Well, I think of it as having three compo-
nents. First of all it involves saying that people’s cultural
identity matters to them: so ignoring or disparaging cultural
identity is a harm. Second, the implication is that if you’re in
a society that contains a diversity of cultures, typically
through histories of migration, then it’s not appropriate to
expect everyone to adopt the values, practices, and traditions
of the dominant majority group. And, third, the public-policy
implication is that it’s likely that the laws and institutions
will reflect the values and practices of the dominant or
majority group; so this is a bias that needs to be either
justified or undone.

NW: That view can clearly come into conflict with a liberal attitude
which encourages people to focus on their freedoms. Because at a certain
point people’s freedoms impinge on one another.

AP: It’s important to recognize that multiculturalism, in a
sense, derives from liberal principles. It derives from
principles of equality: ensuring that majority and minority
groups are treated equably and fairly. It derives from
principles of freedom: if I have the freedom to live my life
according to my own values and beliefs, then why don’t
you? And it derives from the liberal principle of toleration:
respecting even those differences you find challenging or
demanding. However, having said that, there are obvious
areas of conflict. If respecting cultural difference means, for
example, respecting the rights of people who have very
different ways of treating their children, like the extensive
use of corporal punishment, or who have different values
about the roles of women and men that might involve very
constraining and oppressive conditions for women, then that
clearly throws up potential problems.

NW: Well let’s take that example with the role of women. Suppose you
were dealing with a culture where education for women was actually
frowned upon. Liberalism would clearly come into conf lict there with a
multiculturalism that respects every culture’s view of the good life.
A liberal would want to give opportunities to everybody within a
particular society.

AP: Yes, I think there are real conflicts there. But part of the
conflict comes about because of the particular notion of
culture we’re operating with. This is a notion that has
endorsed the view that cultures can be represented by the
spokesmen of a particular cultural group, usually men,
usually older, who explain what are the cherished practices
and values of their group, often in ways that are completely
at odds with what others in that group might say are their
cherished practices and values. In the literature this is often
talked of as the minorities-within-minorities problem. You
want to set in train policies that ensure that minorities
within society are not treated unfairly or disadvantaged, but
some of the mechanisms you put in place may have the effect
of removing protections from minorities within minorities,
typically children, women, homosexuals, groups who are
marginalized within the minority. But a lot of the problem
here derives from an interpretation of multiculturalism
which has taken culture in this very bounded sense of a
cultural group whose needs, interests, and desires can be
interpreted just through its spokesmen—a group that is
thought to have a unified experience and voice. We need
a multiculturalism that dispenses with that particular
understanding of culture.

NW: I’m not sure how that would work in terms of homosexuality in
relation to Islam, for instance. Is there the scope for what I would see as
the liberal approach to homosexuality within an Islamic subculture in,
say, Britain?

AP: Well, there are Muslim gays and lesbians, so at one level
the answer is clearly ‘yes’. I have also heard liberal Muslims
talk about it being a principle of Islam that one doesn’t
interfere with one’s neighbour’s practices, and deriving from
this an argument which didn’t necessarily endorse homosexu-
ality, but certainly sounded quite like the classically liberal
notion that it’s not for me to judge or criticize what you do in
private. This is obviously a very heated issue. One of my
worries about some of the current discourses about multicul-
turalism—I mean here, discourses that attack multicultural-
ism—is that they could encourage communities that feel
themselves under threat to close in on themselves, and start
defining their core traditions in much more restrictive ways.
Where this happens the scope for opening up the possibility
of being a Muslim gay may get closed down.

NW: You’re suggesting that our conception of a Turkish culture or an
African culture is too crude if it’s being created by the dominant group
within that culture. So what’s the alternative? How do we achieve an
adequate definition of a particular culture?

AP: One distinction people sometimes make—which I quite
like though I don’t consistently operate with it—is that we
should stop using the noun ‘culture’, which always conjures
up this sense of something very unified, very bounded. But
we can’t give up on the adjective ‘cultural’, for we are all
enormously shaped by cultural influences and cultural
norms. I don’t know if you ever saw the film The Magdalene
Sisters? It’s based in Ireland in the 1950s and ’60s, when the
Magdalene laundries existed as places where families would
send their daughters who had in some way offended against
social and sexual norms. They had become pregnant outside
marriage or maybe behaved in ways which were regarded as
sluttish or sexually loose. And the fathers, in consultation
with the local priest, would in effect incarcerate their
daughters in these laundries. Nowadays in Ireland this would
be regarded as an unbelievably cruel practice. Clearly you
have to use the notion of culture or cultural shift to explain
this. The 1950s and ’60s was a period characterized by very
strongly held views about sex outside marriage being a sin,
when the Catholic Church still had enormous authority and
fathers still had enormous authority over their children.
There has been what we would regard as a cultural shift. But
having said that, it was never the case that all fathers locked
up their pregnant daughters in Magdalene laundries. Some
families were more horrified than others; some were
horrified but nonetheless supported their daughters; and
some (though probably not many in Ireland in the 1950s) were
relatively untroubled by the transgression. So we need to
have an understanding of cultural influences that allows us
to recognize the enormous diversity within what we as a
form of shorthand describe as ‘culture’. It’s quite a dangerous
shorthand. Talking about ‘Irish culture’ or ‘Turkish culture’
or ‘African culture’ is a risky and implausible shorthand.

NW: Now, within a culture, assuming we can adequately define one,
it’s still possible that, for instance, a woman would completely go along
with what you might see as an oppressive practice because of what a
Marxist would call a ‘false consciousness’. She didn’t really understand
what she needed to make her life go well, and just bought into what you
or I might see as a culturally oppressive regime.

AP: This is a very real and important point. One qualifica-
tion I would make before answering is that I don’t think the
general idea of the happy slave is very plausible. Mostly I
think it’s a figment of the philosopher’s imagination. When
there is oppression, people tend to notice it. Having said that,
of course you’re right: there are situations in which some-
body else is living a life which I might consider deeply
oppressive and she says to me, this is my choice: this is what
I want to do. What then? My view is that in the end you have
to listen to what people say. Of course there are all kinds of
social policies to ensure people really do have alternatives:
these would include housing provision, educational policies,
legal services, all the kind of things which make it more real
for people to say: ‘Yes, I can see the alternatives and this is
my choice.’ And of course, talking is great; we all change our
ideas about what’s possible through talking. But if at the end
of it somebody says, ‘You may think this is oppressive but
this is my choice’, I just think we have to listen to people.

NW: That makes complete sense with reasonably well-informed
adults. But many of the choices we talk about—female circumcision,
some arranged marriages—occur when people aren’t adults and when
they’re not reasonably well-informed.

AP: I have to say I think this is one of the most difficult
areas. With children, there is no question. Public authorities
have the responsibility to protect children. I don’t endorse in
any way female genital cutting or other harms to young
children. The difficult area is young people between the ages
of 12 and 18: at what point do you say, ‘This is your decision’,
and at what point do you say that you are so much at the
mercy of the influences and pressures of your family and
community that we need to step in and protect you? But this
is the kind of problem that the law is dealing with all the
time, it is not something specific to particular kinds of
cultural group. When is someone a child and when an adult?
That’s a very difficult issue, and I don’t feel I have secure
answers. I’m very clear that with adults you listen to what
they say and I’m very clear that with children you protect
them. But of course a lot of difficult issues come in the
middle.

NW: I suppose with reversible decisions it’s not the end of the world if
people make a decision that’s bad for them and can later undo it. But
some things aren’t reversible.

AP: That’s one criterion some people have suggested: that
you should ban any kind of irreversible decision.

NW: If you’re trying to assess whether somebody freely chose some-
thing, their choice to remain within that community could be an index.
So one test might be whether somebody chooses to remain within a
community. Is that a fair point?

AP: It’s only a fair point against the background of a
genuine range of alternatives. Simply interpreting people’s
decisions to stay as evidence that they actively endorse the
life that they’re living can be a very mean-minded way of
reading what people are doing, unless you have a secure
basis for saying that they really do have alternatives. For
example, that there are jobs they could take, places they
could live, that there are support networks for them, that
they could have a genuinely alternative life.

NW: If we had an analogous case where a woman chose to stay with
a husband who beat her, we’d say that her choice to stay there is not
really an indication that she wants that kind of life. It just might be that
she can’t see a way out.

AP: That’s right. We would regard it as a rather cruel
reading—at least I hope we would—to say: ‘Well, she’s
staying with him, it’s her choice, so we can’t see a problem
with the fact that he continues to beat her.’ We do think it’s a
problem that he continues to beat her. But mostly we
understand why it is that people are very reluctant to give up
on relationships. They hope that there’s a chance that he may
change. Of course, sometimes, sadly, they’re wrong, and to
read their decision to stay as evidence that there’s no problem
is misleading. But the complete opposite to that, saying this
woman doesn’t know what she’s doing, is also problematic.

NW: What about a classic problem of multiculturalism in Britain?
There was a case recently of a primary-school teacher who wanted to
wear a full veil for religious reasons and it was felt by a number of people
that this was inappropriate because it was impossible for children to see
her mouth when she was speaking—there were detrimental effects from
an educational point of view. There’s a conf lict between a culturally or
religiously motivated style of dress and the practical difficulties of using
that kind of dress as a teacher. Do you have a way of resolving that kind
of difficulty for multiculturalism?

AP: To the extent that I have a formula, my formula is very
basic. I’m against things which cause physical and mental
harm and I’m against things which treat people unequally—
which includes practices that treat women as inferiors to
men. The difficulty in any culturally diverse society is how
you interpret ‘harm’ and how you interpret ‘equality’. In the
case of the niqab, the full face veil, there are good practical
reasons, to do with the needs of communication between
teachers and students, why it’s not appropriate in the
classroom. In the case you’re talking about, the teaching
assistant was happy to reveal her face in the classroom but
wanted to cover her face when there were male teachers
present. Well, I also think that it’s a bit problematic sending a
message to 11-year-old children that it’s impossible for men
and women to engage in face-to-face communication. So for
both those reasons I think her wearing the niqab in the
school was problematic. But I also think it’s very important
that the decision about such cases isn’t made on the basis that
that woman, though she doesn’t know it herself, is oppressed.
The woman has made her choice, and she’s made it on the
basis of her interpretation of religious requirements.

NW: So would it be fair to say that you still see multiculturalism as
the best way to organize a society that contains many different groups?

AP: If you set up multiculturalism as opposed to monocul-
turalism, multiculturalism has to be the way forward.
Because monoculturalism is inequitable, it’s oppressive, it’s
coercive. But I would argue for what I rather polemically call
a multiculturalism without culture; a multiculturalism no
longer premised on the solidified notions of culture that
encourage and promote cultural stereotypes, and prevent us
developing the kind of multicultural diversity I support.
