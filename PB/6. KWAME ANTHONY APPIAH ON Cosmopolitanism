KWAME ANTHONY APPIAH ON
Cosmopolitanism

David Edmonds: Kwame Anthony Appiah, of Princeton University,
half-English, half-Ghanaian, a US resident, is the quintessential
cosmopolitan. A cosmopolitan, by his definition, is someone who
recognizes that people across societies have much in common, while also
being tolerant of their differences. Negotiating these differences can be
tricky—not least when what’s at stake are deeply held moral or religious
beliefs, such as those surrounding, in the oft-cited case, female circum-
cision or FGM (female genital mutilation). Appiah is optimistic that
talking, discussing, conversing, engaging in respectful dialogue about
difference, is the most effective way of resolving differences—or at least,
the best way of learning to live with them.

Nigel Warburton: We are going to focus on cosmopolitanism. What
do you understand by that term, ‘cosmopolitanism’?

Kwame Anthony Appiah: It is one of these words that got
into English from the Greek. The Greek is kosmopolites,
which means citizen of the cosmos, of the world; so it is
really a way of talking about global citizenship. It is a
particular tradition of talking about global citizenship that
has two strands which are worth identifying. The first is the
idea that we are all collectively responsible for one another:
the idea that we are a sort of single moral community. But a
lot of people think that, and they are not all cosmopolitans.
What’s distinctive about cosmopolitanism is the idea that,
yes, we are all a moral community, but also that we are all
entitled at the same time to live according to different modes
of life. The cosmopolitans think it is good and interesting
and fine that people live different modes of life; they don’t
want everybody to become the same, they don’t want
everybody to become Catholics, or Marxists or even perhaps
liberal democrats.

NW: So another of way of putting that, as you yourself have put it, is
‘universalism plus difference’. And the ‘universalism’ is for some people
hard to stomach: it isn’t obvious that all human beings have a great deal
in common beyond their biology.

KAA: First of all it is important that we have a common
biology because the base level of human well-being and
human suffering comes from our shared biology. If you stick a
pin into the arm of a Chinaman or a Yanomamö Indian neither
of them will like it. The Yanomamö Indian will probably bash
you over the head with a club, so there will be different
responses, but the basic biological stuff is very important. You
can take two possible views about this: one is a very practical
view which is, ‘let’s just see what we agree about and start
from there’. You can take a more philosophical starting-point
and say, ‘is there a basis for deciding that some views, whether
or not they are held by the Chinese or the Yanomamö, are
correct?’, and then try to see what it would take to persuade
everybody of the correctness of those views. At a certain level
of abstraction, I think that the moral views of most of the
people on the planet have quite a lot in common already. But
this is at a certain level of abstraction, and it doesn’t help in
many cases where there are conflicts about what you ought to
do. In those cases you are going to have to make arguments
and see what can be done to persuade people of the correct-
ness of your view. Now I don’t think the cosmopolitan ought
to be committed to any particular, elaborate philosophical
view about the metaphysical status of morality, because that is
exactly one of the controversial things that it would be
difficult to drag into every conversation.

It would be better to start with a set of practices, talking
and listening, and try to figure a way to work out what you
can agree upon and what you can’t agree upon. It is very
important to recognize that that kind of conversational
exchange, across quite wide cultural differences, can actually
produce consensus about all sorts of very important things.
Most people think it is bad when children die of diseases, for
example; most people think we should do our best to cure
them if we can. This is a very substantial kind of agreement.
It is also important to notice that we live perfectly well in
modern societies with neighbours with whom we disagree
about some things. So the fact that there are these disagree-
ments across the planet shouldn’t make us think we can’t live
together in peace, any more than the fact that we have
disagreements at home has made it impossible for us to live
together in peace.

I live in the United States. It couldn’t be more divided a
society on the question of abortion, but a surprisingly large
number of people, many of whom think that killing foetuses
is a very, very bad thing to do, are nevertheless willing to live
within a shared framework of law with people who don’t
believe this.

NW: Yes, indeed, and supporters and opponents of abortion agree on
many aspects of morality.

KAA: Yes, very often when people disagree about what to
do it isn’t a moral disagreement: it is just a disagreement
about how the world is, about what the facts are. If I thought
that there was a divine creator who had commanded us to
save foetuses, then, of course, I would go about the business
of saving foetuses. So some of these disagreements are just
disagreements about who, if anybody, runs the universe, and
what He or She wants. Other disagreements are just about
facts. Take female genital mutilation, a standard example of a
topic on which there is disagreement in the world. There
some of the background disagreements are about sexuality.
If you ask Dinka men why it is important to ‘circumcise’, as
they would put it, their women, they will say, ‘because if we
don’t, we will have to cope with an ungovernable sexuality’.
Now one thing you have then to show them is that in large
parts of the world uncircumcised women are perfectly able
to regulate their sexuality, and so probably this is a mistake.

NW: In that particular case I can understand your approach leads to
greater empathy with the people who make those choices, even though
you disagree strongly with their choices. But I am not convinced that
conversation will lead to a change in practice there. These are very
ingrained beliefs that are resistant to rational debate.

KAA: Look, the claim isn’t, and shouldn’t be, that conver-
sation will resolve everything. It won’t. We have to learn to
live with the fact that for the very long foreseeable future
there will be disagreements within and across societies. And
as the world becomes more and more like a single society,
these will all be more like internal disagreements. But there
will still be lots of disagreements. The conversation is aimed
at being able to live with people, whether you agree with
them or not. I have been giving lectures about the ways in
which people actually change their minds about morality.
On the whole they don’t change their minds simply by being
persuaded by some argument. Life changes in some way, or
you get used to other people doing things, and then you
think, ‘Well why shouldn’t we do that?’ It is much less a
matter of rational persuasion than perhaps a philosopher
would like.

The practice of circumcising Kikuyu women in Kenya, for
example, was on the way out after the Second World War
and it only came back as a kind of counter-reaction to
missionaries, and other people, saying how awful it was:
people went into a nationalist mode, where they defended
this practice as an expression of Kikuyu identity. So this is a
case where, actually, if we had just left it alone it probably
wouldn’t be going on any more. There are important things
to say to people about female genital mutilation, but they
depend upon having had the conversation and figuring out
what it is they think they are doing and why they are doing
it. It is a very important fact in this debate that in many of the
places where it is practised, the practice is thought of as a
Muslim practice. And so it is equally important that there is
nothing in the Koran about it. The practice is mostly carried
out by people who don’t read, and don’t have their own
access to the Koran. Simply telling them that there is a
respectable Muslim traditional argument that says ‘you
mustn’t do this’ is informing them of something that they
care about and that is relevant, given their beliefs as to
whether they should do it.

NW: This is a difficult case for a liberal, because you want to tolerate
other people’s practices. But if these practices are imposed on people
who are not in a position to make an informed choice for themselves,
children, for instance, you might want to be paternalistic and protect
them from it for their own good. Adults making informed choices would
be a different case.

KAA: Paternalism is treating someone like a father, and
children should be treated the way fathers should treat
children. So, if we could stop female genital mutilation
happening to children—if it was in our power—then, I think,
of course, we should. The real question is what we can do to
make it more likely it will stop. Look, if you send in the
marines, it won’t work. What happened in Kenya will be
repeated: you’ll turn it into a nationalist issue and it will
probably raise the frequency with which it occurs. People
who recognize that you take them seriously, that you want
to understand their arguments, that you respect their right to
be participants in a conversation, are more likely to see you
as a reasonable interlocutor, or someone who might have a
point. And so they are more likely to be persuaded. But in
the end, change is going to happen because people in the
societies where it is done will begin to agitate. Probably
many of them will be women, and they’ll refuse to have their
own children treated in these ways. They’ll learn from the
fact that in the rest of the world people who don’t do it seem
to be doing okay, and that the bad things that they suspect
might happen if they stopped aren’t going to happen.

NW: Let’s look at a different problem that might arise for cosmopoli-
tans. If you believe that fundamentally you are a citizen of the world,
there may not be grounds for preferring the people nearest to you to those
who might need your help who are very far away. There may be no
reason to favour family and compatriots over those on the other side of
the world who may be dying of poverty and malnutrition. Some
philosophers have argued that what a responsible citizen of the world
should do is treat all human needs equally, and that would involve us in
the West giving most of our money to Oxfam or to UNICEF, one of the
charities that might be able to save people’s lives. Isn’t that too
demanding a morality?

KAA: Part of what is important here is giving people a
reasonable account of how they ought to conduct them-
selves. Addressing people in the richer parts of the world in
the way that my friend and Princeton colleague Peter Singer
does—by saying, basically, ‘you ought to be depriving
yourself of many, many of the things that are good in your
life, because there are people out there who are suffering’—
coming at people in that way, even supposing it were right, is
not going to work. People are going to turn away from
someone who makes what they will regard as absurdly
demanding claims on them. So the first thing we have to
think about is, what can we ask people to do that they might
actually do, that would help with the problems in the world?

People who are engaged with the rest of the world, who
know about life in places where people are poor and
suffering—that is, people who have a cosmopolitan attitude
and engagement with life—are more likely to be tractable,
more likely to be persuadable to do something. Remember,
though, I don’t think that cosmopolitanism should come
with heavy philosophical baggage, because then you are
making it a condition of the conversation that people agree
with you about something. The whole point about the
conversation is that we will talk to whoever comes along.
Still, my view is that we have the privilege of living in a
world in which we have the resources to give everybody
what they need in order to have the possibility of a decent
human life, and the resources to do this without abandoning
opera, and BBC Radio 3, and all those things that might seem
optional if you were focused entirely on human suffering.

But, second, I think what we owe to others is less than
many philosophical views claim. The reason is that many of
these philosophical views are maximizing views: that is, they
are views according to which we should make sure that
everybody has the most of a possible thing. Whereas I think
that what is crucial in moral life is to make sure that every-
body has what they need in order to lead a decent life, which
is not the same thing as everybody having the most we can
get them, or even the same as everybody having an equal
amount. The real point is that we have these baseline
obligations. They are quite demanding; we are not meeting
them, we should be doing more than we are. But they are not
so demanding that your natural response is just to say, ‘well,
if that is what I am being asked to do, I might as well just
block it out’. One of the extraordinary things about the
present isn’t actually the proportion of people who don’t have
a decent life—even though it is a very large number and we
should be doing something about it—but it is the proportion
of people who do.

NW: That optimism runs through everything I have read of yours—
and it is very inspiring to read. But post-9/11 most people have become
depressed about what is possible in terms of world peace and learning to
live with each other.

KAA: About 9/11: I think people have wildly overreacted.
Of course it was a terrible thing and the people who did it
were wicked people. On the other hand, the number of
people that they killed is very much smaller than the number
of people that die on the American highways month by
month, or year by year. And it turned out that you could
inflict this massive attack on the centre of American business
and the economy shrugged it off after a little while. There
was a little hiccup. So it wasn’t such a big deal, and the fact is,
if they were so powerful they would have done things like
that since, and often; and they haven’t. They haven’t because
they haven’t been able to. They would be even less able if we
had better relations with, and understanding of, the Muslim
world, in which they are, of course, exceptional extremists,
but which nevertheless is a place within which they can, to
some extent, hide from us. Many of the people who hide
them don’t approve of what they are doing and wouldn’t do it
themselves, but they are not going to hand them over to us
either, because they don’t think of us as their friends. And if
we fail to distinguish between the extremists—who are
murderous people whom we should try to capture and
punish—and the rest, we will continue to have that problem.

So we have to have the intellectual clarity and the moral
courage to go on relating to the Muslim world. The first
thing we need to do in thinking about the Muslim world is to
recognize that it is, as our world is—whatever we think of as
our world, the West, Britain, some people think Christen-
dom—internally, incredibly diverse. The traditional Muslim
world runs from Morocco to Indonesia. Hundreds and
hundreds of languages are spoken in the Muslim world.
There are places in the Muslim world where women wear
burkhas and places where they don’t. These are all Muslim
societies and they are very, very different. There are people
in the Muslim world whom it is easy to talk to, who are
delighted to share with us, for example as philosophers, the
fact that their great Arab and Persian Muslim philosophers
drew on the same roots as we did. They were students of
Plato and Aristotle and so on; in fact, if they hadn’t sustained
those texts and looked after them during what we call our
Dark Ages, we wouldn’t have most of them, we wouldn’t
have Aristotle and Plato. So there are lots of people it is easy
to talk to. We have to be willing to build the conversations
with the very many people who would love to talk to us and
we have to figure out a way of communicating with them.
Of course we can disagree with them about lots of things, as
they disagree with us and each other, but we respect what
we share, our humanity and our right to a dignified life.

At the moment they don’t believe we respect them. And
the reason they don’t believe it is because many of us don’t
respect them. They see that we don’t treat them respectfully.
The United States, in its foreign policy (under President
Bush), simply doesn’t put the same weight on the views of
people in the Muslim world as it does on the views of, say,
people in Europe. This can’t be denied—it is just a fact, and
we ought to be trying to communicate and practise respect.

NW: Much of our identity in life comes from our links to a particular
place, to particular families. Doesn’t that conflict with the cosmopolitan
idea of being a citizen of the world?

KAA: That is the point where the cosmopolitan’s ‘univer-
sality plus difference’ really pays off. I said that we have these
baseline obligations to everybody which we aren’t meeting
and we should be. But beyond that we are free to be partial.
Any sensible moral view has to have a place for the idea that
we are entitled—not just that we will, but that we are
entitled—to care more about those whom we love in our
families and those in our community with whom we share
our practices, and those in our nation with whom we share
together the responsibilities of running the state, and so on.
We are entitled to be like that, just as we are entitled to place
a greater weight on our own survival than the survival of
other random people.
