GOD, ATHEISM, AND
THE MEANING OF LIFE

KEITH WARD ON 
Eastern and Western Idealism

David Edmonds: Anglo-American philosophy exhibits its disdain for
Indian philosophy by more or less ignoring it. But that, says Keith
Ward—author of numerous books, including Concepts of God—is a
big mistake. Take ‘idealism’—a theory that the ultimate nature of reality
is non-physical. There’s a parallel tradition of idealism in both East and
West: and according to Professor Ward, each could learn from the other.

Nigel Warburton: We are going to focus on idealism East and West.
So, what is idealism?

Keith Ward: Idealism is the view that the fundamental reality
is spiritual not material. It contrasts with materialism. If you are
a materialist you say ultimately everything is made up of little
material bits and laws governing their interaction, so everything
is ultimately material. Idealism is the opposite of that: reality is
not ultimately material. In fact, matter is an expression or
appearance of something which is not material—you could say
spiritual, or mental, or conscious. So an idealist would think
that ultimately this universe is an expression or manifesta-
tion of a conscious or mental reality.

NW: So this is in the philosophical tradition that distinguishes
between appearance and reality. Most of us think we are moving in a
material world, while idealists believe that what appears to be just a
material world has something beyond it, a deeper reality which is not
material.

KW: That is exactly right. This distinction goes back to
Plato: you think you are in the real world of touches and
sights and sounds and so on, but actually these are appear-
ances of a deeper reality. Some things in modern physics
suggest that might be true as well. Some physicists, those
who propound what is called ‘M theory’, for instance, say
that we are really in an eleven-dimensional curved space-
time. It doesn’t feel like that. And an idealist would agree
that reality is not what it seems to be to common sense.
Reality, beneath the appearances, is mental or conscious in
its nature.

NW: In eastern philosophy there is a great tradition of this kind of
idealism.

KW: Yes, there is. In fact, it is true of most Indian schools of
philosophy that they make a big distinction between matter
and spirit. Obviously I am using English words for that (the
Sanskrit words are prakriti and purusha). They say that spirit
has a greater reality than matter. There are lots of different
Indian schools of philosophy, but most people would say that
the dominant one is Vedanta, a philosophy that is based on
the Indian sacred scriptures, the Upanishads. Vedantic schools
are idealist, basically, and they say that Brahman—you could
translate that as the Absolute Reality—has the nature of
being, consciousness, and bliss, Sat—Chit—Ananda, and
everything is part of that one underlying reality. That’s the
Vedantic school of philosophy, which is one of the six major
Indian schools of philosophy, and, as I say, probably the
best-known among philosophers.

NW: So that combines idealism with a kind of monism—everything is
ultimately one underneath the world of appearances.

KW: That is right. An idealist does not have to be a monist.
You could think, like the English philosopher John McTag-
gart, that there are lots of different minds. Jains, the
Indian-originated religious group, believe that too. But the
Vedantic tradition is monistic. They would use a text from
the Upanishads to support their position that ‘all is Brah-
man’—everything is one—we are all parts of this absolute
reality.

NW: What follows from that belief in the Vedantic tradition? How
should we live? How should we interact with the material world?

KW: Well, there are different interpretations, as always.
But one interpretation would be that you and I aren’t really
different beings. We are not alien to each other; we are,
literally, part of the same united reality. The claim would be
that to see that, you would probably have to be enlightened;
and if you were enlightened and you saw that we are all parts
of one reality, then that would overcome opposition and
conflict and violence, because you would think, ‘nothing is
mine and nothing belongs to me, because I am just part of
the whole’. So there is an ethical implication of this, for most
Vedantians. I suppose the view would be that our individual
selves are illusory in some sense: they are like the skins of an
onion, you peel them away, your personality, your traits,
different dispositions you have. You take those away and you
find that your true self, which is called Atman, the true inner
self, is actually the same in everyone. We literally aren’t
different, in some sense. Separateness and individuality is an
illusion, an illusion due to ignorance. When you realize that
you are not an individual self that can possess something, but
you are actually identical in your innermost reality with
everyone else and with everything else, then possessiveness
becomes a logical absurdity. That is the claim of one of the
greatest Vedantin philosophers, probably the best-known in
the West, Shankara, who lived probably in the eighth
century AD.

NW: Was he a Buddhist philosopher?

KW: That is a very good question. Absolutely not, but yes!
By that I mean his philosophy was invented in order to get
rid of Buddhism from India, which he successfully accom-
plished. But he did it by taking over all the Buddhist insights.
This is a very naughty thing to say, but most scholars would
agree that what Shankara did was use all the Buddhist
insights, incorporate them into Hinduism, and say, ‘we don’t
need Buddhism any more because we have got it all’. So he is
crypto-Buddhist. But he would definitely say: ‘I am absolutely
not a Buddhist!’

NW: Now, to be a bit sceptical here, why would anybody believe
this—what is the evidence?

KW: That is not a question that would have arisen for
Shankara or for the other best-known Vedantin philosopher
Ramanuja. They believed in scriptural authority. If you look
at classical Indian philosophy in the early medieval period,
they just accept the Upanishads and the Veda as revealed,
divinely given truth—given by the gods or supernatural
beings. So Shankara just said: ‘I believe this because it is in
the scriptures.’ Now things have changed, interestingly. So if
you go to India today and you look at Vedantin philosophers,
they will say, ‘the evidence is personal experience of libera-
tion’; so you know that it is true because you meditate, you
break through the boundaries of self and egoism, and you
actually experience a unity with the all. That stress on
experience, ironically, comes from the German philosophical
tradition which has been imported into India since the
nineteenth century and has given rise to what is now called
Neo-Vedanta. Neo-Vedanta doesn’t say, ‘we believe this just
because it is in the scripture’. Neo-Vendantins would say, ‘we
believe this because somebody, perhaps me but perhaps some
guru that I follow, has experienced liberation and experi-
enced this unity with the all’. So now it is personal experi-
ence that has become important. That is not true for the
classical tradition.

NW: Obviously within the western philosophical tradition idealism is
associated with German eighteenth- to nineteenth-century philosophy. Is
there a causal inf luence there? Does German philosophy borrow from
Indian idealism?

KW: Many PhDs have been written on this subject. My
own view is that there wasn’t a close textual influence.
People like Hegel in Germany had not carefully read all the
Indian philosophers. They didn’t have the languages and
they didn’t have access to the scriptures, as we now do,
thanks to the Internet and so on. So they didn’t have the
knowledge; but they got some big ideas, I think, from India.
Hegel’s big idea can be centred on his definition of infinity.
Classically Christian philosophers in the West had said that
God is infinite and the infinite is completely opposed to the
finite, and therefore God, the infinite, and the finite universe
have nothing in common. They are completely different; the
infinite excludes the finite by definition. What Hegel did was
to say, ‘no, actually the concept of infinity entails that
nothing is outside it. If it is infinite it excludes nothing.
Therefore, by definition, but a different definition, every-
thing must be part of the infinite’; and that was the big move
Hegel made to a monistic and spiritual view of what he
called the ultimate reality, Geist or absolute spirit. This move
originated in Hegel thinking about what was meant by the
notion of infinity—which was becoming a subject of enquiry
in mathematics as well at that time. That debate wasn’t
influenced by the Indian traditions, but Hegel had read the
available texts, the Upanishads and so on, and must have seen
a similarity. So there was a general influence, but it wasn’t
technically informed—and Hegel, I am sorry to say, didn’t
think much of Indian religious thought.

NW: But Schopenhauer was more explicitly indebted to Indian
thought, I believe.

KW: He certainly was. But again he didn’t really know the
texts in any detail. He knew what had been translated of the
Upanishads; and of course they are partly, but importantly,
philosophical documents. If you read the Bible it is not
philosophical, you would find it very difficult to find
philosophical arguments in it; but in the Upanishads you find
a concentration on the nature of reality, the nature of the
self, and the argument that the true self is identical with the
supreme reality.

So they are partly philosophical sorts of texts, and
Schopenhauer was very influenced by them. One reason
they were used by Schopenhauer in particular was because
he didn’t like the very anthropomorphic views of God with
which he was familiar in German Lutheranism. He thought,
you’ve got to get away from thinking of God as a person who
arbitrarily sends people to hell or not. So I think he found in
the Indian tradition a very different approach; though still a
spiritual approach. Schopenhauer, although he was called the
first great German atheist, wasn’t really an atheist at all: he
just didn’t like God. He didn’t like the word ‘God’. But he
thought that the nature of reality was spiritual. He was an
idealist, in other words, and I think, yes, he was really
influenced by Indian modes of thought.

NW: In Anglo-American philosophy, idealism f lourished at the end of
the nineteenth century. But now most contemporary British and
American philosophers look on that as a phase that we have moved
beyond. Is that a fair assessment?

KW: I think that is a fair assessment of the actual situation,
but there are a few of us idealists left, and we are a growing
band; there will be four by next year! Idealism is not
fashionable—that is very true. One reason for that is the
great success of science which focuses on explaining human,
mental elements of consciousness in neuro-physiological
terms. That’s had a great influence towards materialism. But
I think most of the main arguments for idealism are still in
place, and quite surprisingly perhaps you can find them in
the work of some quantum physicists. People like Roger
Penrose, the Oxford mathematical physicist, for example. He
says that maybe consciousness is fundamental to reality, in
some sense. And some mathematicians and physicists, as well
as a number of philosophers, are prepared to ‘come out’ as
Platonists—so there are a few of us.

The big question still remains, isn’t it true that conscious-
ness may have an ineliminable place in our ontology? You
can’t get rid of it. And then the question is, well does it just
emerge from matter? If it is different from matter, does it just
emerge? Or could matter be seen as something which only
exists when consciousness exists? That is a view I would hold
myself. Obviously I’d need a long time to convince anybody,
if I ever could, but idealism is still around in that form. All
the things we see and touch and feel are actually elements of
consciousness. Possibilities collapse into actualities only in
consciousness—and maybe possibilities can only exist in
consciousness too. That is a philosophical view that is still
worthy of careful examination.

NW: In your own philosophical development have you felt that you
have learnt from your studies of Indian philosophy anything that you
couldn’t have learnt from the study of western philosophy?

KW: Well, I think the Indian philosophical traditions are
very interesting. They begin from a different place than the
western tradition. The western tradition begins from
thinking that a supreme consciousness would be a creator
who is not identical with the creation and who created, for
some reason, to get something done of some sort. Whereas
Indian traditions don’t start there; they start from asking,
what is the nature of this reality that we are in? They say, in
the Vendantic tradition, that its nature is pure spirit. So they
are not talking about another reality, they are talking about
the true inner nature of this reality. There is no reason why
Indian idealists shouldn’t talk about God; they usually do, in
fact, say that God is a sort of picture image of absolute
consciousness. But you mustn’t think of God as another
person. That would be quite wrong.

This is a philosophically deep view. You are asking
questions about the nature of consciousness and whether
consciousness is necessarily something that has to be
embodied in a human brain and body. My own answer, is
‘no, not necessarily’. I don’t see any necessity in that. And
then if you explore the hypothesis that there is a conscious-
ness which isn’t at all embodied and which could have
something like thoughts and intelligence, then it would be
possible that this material universe was an expression of that
cosmic consciousness. You could then go on to see whether
the observed facts are illuminated by such a hypothesis. I
think they are.

Perhaps I should say that in the Indian tradition there are
two ways of taking this postulate of the material world as the
expression of a supreme spiritual reality, which you might
call a negative way and a positive way. The negative way is,
you say ‘the whole of our empirical reality is an illusion’.
People use the word Maya. An illusion is something that is
simply false; it is like a mirage in the desert, and you say,
‘well, it is not there’. Once you see through it, you see that
reality is just the one unified consciousness. That is the
negative view. But there is a positive view which is more
associated with Ramanuja rather than Shankara.

Ramanuja probably lived in the twelfth century AD. He
came after Shankara, and he held that the material universe
is not an illusion. The model that Ramanuja used was that
the world, the universe, is the body of the lord. So the idea of
the universe as God’s body actually goes back to twelfth-
century Indian philosophy. Saying that the world is the body
of God has a positive feel; for then maybe the universe is an
expression of some of the potentialities within the divine
consciousness which have to be expressed.

That sounds very much like Hegel—that the whole of
history is the progressive self-revelation of the absolute spirit.
Where Hegel introduced something new was the idea of
evolution or development—that history is a progressive
revelation of the absolute. This passed back into more recent
Indian thought which is able to accept an evolutionary view
in the sense of a progressive revelation, bit by bit, of what
absolute reality is like.

NW: Given the richness of the philosophical tradition in Indian
thought, why do you think it has been so marginalized in western
philosophy departments?

KW: Well, the language is difficult: you have to have
Sanskrit, and Sanskrit is a very difficult language to learn.
And it is partly because the Indian traditions are classically
scripturally based on a very different scripture—the
Upanishads—from anything in the West. Western philoso-
phers have tended to say, ‘this is not philosophy, this is just
taken from an allegedly revealed knowledge’. But you have
to take your premises from somewhere anyway, and the
interesting philosophical question is, where do we go from
there? Perhaps, as I have suggested, there may also be
independent arguments for idealism—arguments from
consciousness and personal experience—that are worth
exploring. It’s a pity, however, that both Indian philosophy
and idealism are rather neglected fields in the West. Maybe
this will all change, as the pendulum swings again, as it so
often does in the history of philosophy.
