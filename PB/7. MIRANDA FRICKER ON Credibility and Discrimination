Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites

MIRANDA FRICKER ON
Credibility and Discrimination

David Edmonds: Suppose, in a court case, members of a jury are more
sceptical of black witnesses than white ones. Suppose a woman makes a
point in a business meeting, and is ignored, while the same point, made
by her male colleague, is greeted with nods and murmurs of approval.
Miranda Fricker, a philosopher at Birkbeck, University of London,
believes there’s an important type of injustice going on here—an
injustice that has hitherto been ignored. She labels it ‘testimonial
injustice’—and it’s a type of injustice wrapped up with the theory of
knowledge, what philosophers call epistemology. Testimonial injustice
involves a hearer, or listener, not taking the statements of a speaker—a
knower—as seriously as they deserve to be taken. If we’re guilty of this
we’re guilty of not according the speaker appropriate respect.

Nigel Warburton: Knowledge and justice are two concepts philos-
ophers tend to discuss independently of each other, but in your work
you’ve brought them together. Could you say a little about how you
did that?

Miranda Fricker: Yes, for years I was interested in how
issues of social identity and power impinge on how we
operate as knowers and enquirers. And it’s been something
that’s been talked about a lot in feminist philosophy but very
rarely, if ever, in mainstream epistemology or ethics. My first
interest has really been in the primary case of what I call
epistemic injustice, namely testimonial injustice. That’s
when one person is telling another person something and the
hearer, owing to some prejudice, deflates the level of
credibility they give to the speaker. When that happens I
think the hearer is doing the speaker a distinctive kind of
injustice. She’s undermining him specifically in his capacity
as a giver of knowledge. So imagine, for instance, a white
police officer pulling over a black driver to ask him ‘Is this
your car?’ And the driver replies that it is. If the credibility
afforded the driver by the police officer is deflated by racial
prejudice, then the police officer has done the driver an
injustice in his capacity as knower. More particularly, the
speaker has been undermined in his capacity as a giver of
knowledge. That seems to me a distinctive kind of epistemic
injustice, which merits having its own label—testimonial
injustice.

NW: So the policeman who’s got a prejudice doesn’t give credibility to
somebody from a particular ethnic group. Isn’t that just an empirical
question, a question about how people happen to behave?

MF: In part it’s certainly an empirical question, though I
don’t know of any sociology of knowledge which is specifi-
cally about this issue. There’s a lot of sociology and social
psychology about prejudice and stereotyping and there’s
very interesting work done in the United States by Claude
Steele, for instance, about what he calls ‘stereotype threat’.
For example, in one experiment using American students
where the group is a mix of African-American and white
American, if you tell them all that it’s specifically an experi-
ment to test intellectual ability, the black American students
tend to do worse; whereas if you tell them specifically that
it’s not a test of intellectual ability, they don’t do worse. The
conclusion is that the imaginative presence of a negative
stereotype of oneself as a member of a group who achieves
less well intellectually than others is enough to cause you to
perform less well. And there’s a lot of that sort of empirical
work that’s fascinating and feeds into my interest in epis-
temic injustice. But I haven’t yet discovered anyone who’s
looked at the particular mechanism of how prejudice affects
levels of credibility given.

Now, something else you’re raising in your question is
how recognizable are these issues as genuinely philosophical?
In the past many philosophers would have thought this just a
matter of sociology of knowledge—a purely empirical
matter. One is, after all, concerned with real-life phenomena,
like who gets believed and who doesn’t, or whose word is
taken seriously. They’d have thought these are ethically
important matters but they’re not really philosophical
questions, certainly not ones relevant to epistemology. But
these days I don’t think many people think like that in
philosophy. And the theory of knowledge, specifically, has
moved in the direction of taking ethical matters seriously. So
there are lots of people doing what’s called virtue epistemol-
ogy, thinking about what sorts of virtues are needed on the
part of knowers and enquirers (hearers, for instance—people
who are, or should be, listening for the truth, attempting to
listen beyond prejudices in order to pick up knowledge that’s
offered to them by no matter who). The surge in virtue
epistemology has opened the door to seeing questions of
epistemic injustice as genuinely philosophical, indeed
genuinely epistemological, in a way that didn’t used to be
the case.

NW: So it’s injustice if you treat people unfairly. But some people are
better sources of information than others. I would attribute greater
authority to somebody who’s trained for ten years as a doctor than to
somebody who’s just intuited what my illness would be.

MF: That’s exactly right. And that’s why there’s no testimo-
nial injustice unless there’s a prejudice there. So supposing
it’s the case that women know less about football than men.
Now I might personally be a keen football fan, so that I’m
unexpectedly expert on the relative talents of the players and
on which teams are in what division, and yet somebody
might be casting around for information about the recent
score and not think to ask me because I’m a woman. Or I
might express an opinion about one team and their first
thought might be: ‘What does she know about it?’ Now I’m
open to the possibility that they would be operating with an
empirically reliable stereotype. So far as I know, women in
general aren’t great football enthusiasts; so other things
being equal, it’s relatively unlikely that a woman will know
the recent football results, and so someone might reasonably
overlook me as a potential informant and choose to ask a
man instead. That’s probably fair enough; I don’t think such
a person would have done me any injustice. Suppose,
however, I start offering him evidence that goes against this
reliable stereotype he’s been using—maybe I start chatting in
an unusually well-informed way about this or that team—
and suppose he still doesn’t hear me. That’s the point where
his hanging on to the normally reliable stereotype comes to
be actually prejudiced. Because my behaviour is effectively
offering him lots more evidence (about me as a potential
informant about the score) to which he’s blind. He’s resisting
the new evidence because of the power of the stereotype
that’s operating in his mind. But it’s only at that point, in my
view, that prejudice is entering into it and that he’s starting to
do me some sort of epistemic injustice.

NW: Would you say it’s an injustice to give somebody too much
credibility? For example, if Prince Charles starts pontificating about the
environment or architecture there’s a kind of injustice done to him in
treating him as an expert in a field in which he might not be particularly
well educated.

MF: That’s another great question. I changed my mind
about this issue. When I first wrote about epistemic injustice
I talked as if not only ‘credibility deficit’ but also ‘credibility
excess’ was a case of epistemic injustice. But over time I came
to the view that credibility excess is not an epistemic
injustice, at least not in my sense. I think our intuition that
there is something very wrong with giving excess credibility
to, say, father figures is sound; but what’s wrong with it is
we’re assuming (probably quite often rightly) that such
a positive bias goes with some correlative negative bias:
too much credibility for father figures implies not
enough credibility for other figures. But my particular
concern is whether the individual speaker is wronged by
getting the excess level of credibility. And it seems to me
that if I give a paternal figure a credibility excess I don’t
thereby wrong him. So, although if you look at a system
where one group is getting too much credibility there’s
bound to be another who’s suffering a deficit, still the one
who receives the excess is not thereby wronged.

NW: I wasn’t clear why the injustice that you talk about actually is an
injustice. Is it because people lose their dignity through not being treated
with respect, or is it because knowledge won’t come out this way?

MF: The injustice is the first thing—a matter of intrinsic
insult. There is also the epistemic dysfunction which is the
second thing you mentioned—the prejudiced hearer will
tend to miss out on knowledge offered by certain sorts of
speaker. Indeed, it’s not just epistemically disadvantageous
for him individually (he misses out on knowledge), it’s also
bad for the epistemic community as a whole. It’s bad for all
the enquirers and knowers who want the flow of informa-
tion and ideas to be free of blockages. Where there’s
testimonial injustice there’ll be less truth flowing, fewer
good ideas flowing. But that’s not where the injustice lies.
The injustice lies in the way in which I undermine you as
an individual, and specifically in your capacity as a knower,
if I allow prejudice to deflate my credibility judgement of
your word. To be recognized as a knower is to be recog-
nized as rational; and we’re all used to the general idea
in the history of philosophy that our rationality is what
gives human beings their special dignity, their special value.
So if I undermine you in your capacity as a knower, then
I undermine you in a capacity that is essential for human
value.

There can be grave cases, and trivial cases. Where it’s a
racial prejudice and it really matters, for example at the end
of Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird, where we find the
defendant being charged with rape just because none of the
white jurors believe the word of a ‘negro’, then the injustice
matters deeply, and indeed in that case the consequences
prove fatal. But even if I undermine you only a tiny bit,
because my hearing you with a prejudiced ear is of no real
consequence to you or anyone else, still I’ve given a little
pinprick at your very humanity. In either sort of case,
momentous or trivial, the speaker is being undermined in a
capacity that’s essential to human value. That insult is the
intrinsic wrong at the core of any epistemic injustice.

NW: Is it fair to describe you as an ethicist in what you’re doing? Your
main interest is in right and wrong, not actually in how we come to
know things?

MF: Certainly; indeed, fifteen or so years ago that would
have been the only natural way to put it. But in the last decade
or two epistemology has moved in the direction of ethics in
the general sense that a lot of people are now interested in
what’s called value-driven epistemology. And a key commit-
ment of value-driven epistemology is that we focus on what
sorts of virtues enquirers need to have in order to be good
knowers and effective enquirers. This brings the business of
ethics and epistemology closer together in everybody’s mind.

NW: What do you mean by virtue there? Is virtue just a habit?

MF: Habit is certainly the crux of the matter. Let me give the
relevant example of virtue. The particular virtue that the
hearer needs to have, in order to counteract the ever-present
risk that he or she is going to allow a prejudice to deflate the
credibility she gives to a given speaker, is some sort of
corrective virtue. Let’s assume—this is my own pessimistic
view—that prejudices often enter into our judgements
without our permission, so that even if I’m a thoroughly
unprejudiced person at the level of my beliefs, still my
judgements of credibility might be affected by prejudice. Let’s
say I’m a card-carrying feminist and all my beliefs are in very
good order sexism-wise, and I don’t believe for a moment that
women politicians don’t have good enough judgement or
statesmanlike gravitas to be world leaders; still, it seems to
me, our collective social imagination is full of prejudiced
stereotypes of political authority that give men a significant
advantage—witness the notion of ‘statesmanlike’ behaviour
and so forth. Now for all I know, when a woman politician is
up there on the platform asking for my vote, somehow I just
don’t take her word quite as seriously as the similarly skilled
male politician next to her. If so, I need to have some kind of
corrective mechanism to try and make sure that doesn’t
happen, or not for long. Some kind of mechanism that
prompts me to ask myself, how should I really compare these
two speakers? And if I am able to make that corrective
mechanism habitual, then it seems to me I’m on my way to
possessing a distinctive intellectual-ethical virtue.

NW: From a practical point of view, if I take seriously your theory,
how am I going to change my behaviour?

MF: Well I don’t know—you may be thoroughly virtuous!
For my part I think if prejudice is entering in at the level of
belief, rather than more stealthily by way of stereotypical
images, then we’ll have some ability to police our own
judgements, so that we can adjust our beliefs in the appropri-
ate way. But the trouble may be significantly worse even if
our beliefs are in okay shape. Let’s say we’re still living in a
relatively socially immobile class-driven society, and let’s say
you have no class-prejudiced beliefs. Nonetheless, you may
have reason to fear that prejudiced attitudes and ideas subtly
influence your judgements—so what should you do about it?
One of the great problems here is that there’s a lot of
empirical evidence to suggest that in policing one’s own
prejudices by paying lots of negative attention to those
prejudices only makes it worse. So ideally what we ought to
do is just try and change our habits without too much
reflection, find some way of practising giving higher levels of
credibility to the groups you fear you may be giving too low
levels to. That’s what some equal-opportunities training
programmes aim to help us do. What one hopes to achieve is
a change to one’s spontaneous, unreflective habits of social
perception and credibility attribution.

On the other hand, there’s a place for reflection and
critical awareness. Like most ethical phenomena, once you
become more aware of testimonial injustice (whether you’re
on the delivering or receiving end, or both), so that you can
recognize it and put a name to it when it happens, then
you’re surely in a better position to do something about it. If
you’re on the receiving end, then you can make a complaint,
you can protest it; if you’re dishing it out, you can admit it
and maybe make amends. I don’t expect people to start using
the words ‘testimonial injustice’, but the notion of credibility
deficit might be a useful label—something to help bring out
this implicit aspect of unequal opportunities. We’re all aware
of occasions where people suffer credibility deficit in the
workplace—round the meeting-room table, or whatever it
may be, somehow nobody quite hears her point until the
other guy makes it in his voice. The driving prejudice on any
given occasion may be to do with gender, or with race, or it
may be to do with class, or accent, or whatever it is, but it’s
useful to have a label like ‘credibility deficit’ to help inform
our understanding of the sometimes very subtle ways in
which people can be unjustly undermined by epistemic
discrimination.
