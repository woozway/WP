AESTHETICS

ALAIN DE BOTTON ON
The Aesthetics of Architecture

David Edmonds: Alain de Botton wrote three novels before writing
a book, How Proust Can Change Your Life, which became a
bestseller and changed his life. He has since penned several books—all
of them international hits. They’re both confessional and essayistic.
His topics range from literature to travel—and, as we’re about to hear,
architecture.

Nigel Warburton: Wittgenstein was one of the relatively few
thinkers who combined a practical interest in architecture—he built a
modernist house for his sister in Vienna—with a theoretical interest. He
famously said: ‘You think philosophy’s difficult, but it’s nothing
compared to the difficulty of being a good architect.’ Now you quoted
that in your book The Architecture of Happiness; is it fair to describe
that book as an investigation of the idea encapsulated in Wittgenstein’s
remark?

Alain de Botton: Yes partly. And partly it’s an attempt to
look at the question, what is beautiful in architecture? What
is a beautiful building and how do we know when we see
one and what’s going on when we describe something as
beautiful? It falls quite traditionally in a long line of books on
aesthetics.

NW: So what is beauty in architecture?

AdB: It’s many things. When we describe buildings as
beautiful we’re alluding to material versions of many of the
qualities that we think of as good in other parts of life. So
there’s a real correspondence between what you might
broadly call human virtue as listed by, say, Aristotle in his
ethics—different qualities that you might find in a good
person—and things that are going on in a good building.
And you pick this up when people talk about buildings.
They’ll say, that building looks a bit arrogant, or that
building looks heavy, or that building looks elegant. These
are words in which you can praise and damn both humans
and buildings. My book is an attempt to identify certain
themes that are likely to be going on in buildings that are
satisfying.

NW: There’s also a sense of the potential moral force of buildings:
the way a building might seem to promise to make your life go better.

AdB: Yes, again this is a traditional question of aesthetics,
which is, can good art make us into good people? The hope
is also, yes it can. The way I look at it is that works of art do
have a moral in the sense that they do have suggestions as
to how we might behave. You can look at a glass, a chair, a
picture, and it has certain suggestions about what might be
appropriate behaviour if we were to take that work of art
seriously. But these are merely suggestions rather than
binding laws. Good architecture is a suggestion about good
behaviour, but nothing more nor less than that.

NW: It’s intriguing for me that you talk about art and architecture
interchangeably as though it’s obvious that architecture is art. Is that
what you believe?

AdB: The side of architecture that interests me is very close
to art and I think it can be called art. There are, of course,
other sides. Architecture is also business, it’s about shelter,
it’s about putting your clothes away, it’s about lots of things.
But insofar as it’s been a prestigious and meaningful activity,
I think it’s because people have seen it in the way in which
they’ve seen many of the art forms.

NW: But architecture also has a functional element. That became
most obvious with modernist architecture. Architects like Le Corbusier
argued that the form should follow from the function.

AdB: That proposal—that form should follow function—
has been one of the great red herrings of modernist architec-
ture. Because the function of a building, when we first hear
that sentence, seems to be identified with a mechanical side
of things, the sheltering side. Whereas, of course, the real
function of a building encompasses both sheltering and also
what John Ruskin calls ‘speaking’. He has a lovely quote
when he says buildings shouldn’t just shelter us, they should
speak to us. He says they should speak to us of all the things
that we think are most important and that we need to be
reminded of on a daily basis. So the idea is that buildings
should be the repositories of certain values, ideas, sugges-
tions, and that they should reflect these back to us, so as to
inspire us. That conceptual boldness that Ruskin goes in for
gets to the heart of why we really care about buildings in the
way that we don’t care so much about forks or completely
functional—mechanically functional—objects.

NW: To go back to Le Corbusier, he did talk about ‘machines for
living’. In his writing he’s emphasizing grain silos, ships, constructions
where people have been focusing on achieving a certain functional
element with a by-product that you get a very streamlined design.

AdB: People like Corbusier and Mies Van der Rohe found
many of the works of technology, in the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries, very beautiful. And that’s why they
liked them. They didn’t like them because they were
functional, they liked them because they were beautiful. But
it didn’t fit their agenda to suggest that that was why they
liked them. So they appealed to science as the most pres-
tigious force in society. If you had intemperate clients and
you wanted to try and persuade them that the roof should be
one shape rather than another, instead of saying, ‘Oh well, I
like this shape because it’s beautiful’, you could say to them,
‘Ah no, no, no, it’s like this because of science, science
dictates it.’ That’s much more convincing. And we find that
same argument going on now with ecological architecture:
the same emphasis on the idea that the reason why buildings
look a certain way is because the ecological scientific
programme is demanding it. If you talk to Norman Foster
about why the Reichstag looks the way it does, he won’t ever,
ever mention the word beauty. But he’ll constantly mention
air circulation, water pumps, etc., etc. There’s almost been a
taboo in architecture about the most visceral and interesting
aspect of what architects are up to which is, is it beautiful
or not?

NW: Yes, in your book you talk about the flat roof of modernism
which scientifically is clearly not a rational way to build. It’s sold to the
client as the rational way to build. Actually it’s there for reasons of
elegance and beauty.

AdB: That’s right. It’s there because, to go back to Ruskin,
it’s speaking about the right things. What the architects of
the modernist movement wanted was a stage-set for a
particular way of life that would be democratic, elegant,
based around technology as an almost mystical force for
solving problems. And one could be awestruck—as previ-
ous generations might have been awestruck by the power
of nature—by the power of technology. So it was a roman-
tic attachment to technology. Whether or not it worked
was, I genuinely think, secondary. So even if you look at an
architect like Mies Van der Rohe, many of his skyscrapers,
despite his insistence that he’s a builder and he doesn’t care
about aesthetics, have all sorts of what you could call ‘fake’
detailing. Many of the details around his skyscrapers are
there simply for reasons of aesthetics: they serve absolutely
no mechanical purpose. I don’t mind. I think that’s great.
All the better for it. But there’s an intellectual dishonesty
there.

NW: If you accept that beauty is a key concept in architecture, it puts
us in a strange position. It invites an aestheticism about living. But
many of us think aestheticism is not the right way to live: we shouldn’t
prioritize beauty above certain ethical issues.

AdB: This has always been a great tension. You find this
tension in the history of Christianity—most famously in the
battles between the Catholics and the Protestants about what
you’re going to do with the church. Do you need to spend a
lot of money putting angels on the ceiling and gilding
pilasters, or can you just get on and worship in a bare room?
And you find secular versions of this argument. Should
we get on with living, or should we worry about the door-
handles? I don’t think it’s an either–or situation; we’re an
extremely wealthy civilization and we deserve to get both
aspects of life right. Of course, there’s such a thing as taking
beauty too seriously. Oscar Wilde was helpful in the history
of humanity for showing us what can happen when the love
of beauty gets out of hand: his claim that he’d be more upset
by the wrong kind of wallpaper than a death in the family—
it’s that kind of extremity that helpfully reminds us that there
are all sorts of things that have claims on us: family life,
political life, etc., and that a well-ordered life means slotting
these things in at the right moment. But to say that beauty
has no claim on us is also going too far.

NW: I was thinking of somebody who hadn’t got much money, who’s
condemned to live in a world of landlord kitsch. Now that person doesn’t
have an option of beauty.

AdB: Some people have responded to that problem by
thinking, if we say that beauty is very important and there
are people who are not enjoying beauty, then that will make
that person’s life very miserable. And that seems like an
unkind thing to do. We must surely focus on the positive.
That’s one way of interpreting the situation. The other way
of interpreting it is to say, if we genuinely think that beauty is
important and there are some people who really don’t have
any access to beauty, rather than denying that this is a
problem we should absolutely admit that this is a problem
and try and fix it. It’s the grossest form of patronization and
cruelty to pretend it’s not important. You only need to spend
time with people whose lives are genuinely materially and
practically hard to realize that beauty matters more than
ever. And the taste that we would call the chocolate-box
taste, the idea of making an interior extremely sweet, very
over-decorated, lots of pictures, lots of stuff going on, is
frequently associated with people whose lives are very hard.
In other words, it’s not as though if your life is hard you’re
happy to be living in a bare concrete cell; you’re frequently
going to be taking quite extreme and actually quite naive
steps to try and improve it and aestheticize it. Think about
the garden gnome; the impulses that lead to the garden
gnome are very interesting and should not be dismissed. It’s
the garden gnome itself that should be questioned. It’s an
impatient response to a genuine desire for sweetness in lives
that are very hard.

NW: So you’re not a relativist about beauty. There is an absolute right
answer about which things are beautiful and which are not?

AdB: Again, this is an issue that if forced can tie you up in
knots. It’s rather like literature. Can we say that the words on
the back of the cornflake packet are as good as Shakespeare?
I take the common-sense Humean notion, that if people for
centuries have seen the value of Shakespeare there’s likely to
be something in it. We can’t say definitively what is beautiful
and what is ugly, in the way that we can ask does water boil
at this temperature or that temperature. These are not
scientific truths, these are humanistic truths. That doesn’t
mean that they’re not valuable truths, because after all we
are human beings. So they’re part of society’s conventions
and stock of ideas. It’s extreme politeness and scepticism
which has led us to a situation where many of the most
intelligent and most privileged people in our society will
hesitate to say that building Y is better than building Z even
if it’s utterly obvious. And while they’re debating that,
property-developers come along and go, ‘Oh well, I’ve heard
there’s real debate about what’s beautiful, and this is our
answer and if you don’t like it you must be a snob.’ This
debate has been a gift to property-developers.

NW: If beauty is in part about the relation between objective qualities
in the world and the perceiving person, one way of changing things is not
to change the world but to change the perceiver. And it seems to me that
what you’re doing is trying to move people into a direction where they’re
prepared to change. You talk about recognizing the aesthetic beauty of a
wall of concrete. That’s something that’s not easy for a lot of people, but
with a certain kind of attention it’s possible to make a change in one’s
perceptions.

AdB: What many writers have done is to try and interest
people in things they didn’t know they were interested in: to
validate areas of curiosity. It’s an odd feature about the way
human beings work that there are many things that we’re
interested in that we don’t know if it’s acceptable to be
interested in them. It’s one of the minor tragedies of social
life that you’re often in a group of people and you say, ‘God,
isn’t it amazing the way leaves sway in the wind’, and you
might be at school or in an unsympathetic area and people
go, ‘Oh that’s pretentious, what nonsense.’ One of the great
things about life is discovering people who do think that’s
important and there is a weight to be accorded to that
experience. And there are other things that we have never
really looked at or we have bad associations around. Maybe
somebody told us that concrete was nasty stuff that they
used in tower blocks in the 1960s and we never went any
further with that thought. Somebody else comes along and
says, look, something went a little bit wrong, but let’s look at
concrete, it’s an ancient and fascinating material, etc. That
gives you licence to develop and deepen that interest. I think
that’s the role of many, many art forms—to legitimate
certain questions and certain sensitivities.

NW: And if you had to pick out a building that is for you particularly
beautiful, which would it be?

AdB: Well, in London, Tate Modern is an example of a
building that does a lot of things well. It reminds us that a
good civic building should make a city more liveable, it
should be a place of encounter. It’s also a building which
projects certain ideals. Many buildings traditionally have
projected ideals of nobility, the wisdom of ancient Greece
and Rome, traditional ideals of classical architecture.
Architects have struggled to come up with the idea of what
values modern buildings might be proposing. It seems to me
that a building like Tate Modern is a quintessentially
modern British building. If one asked what would one like
life in Britain to be like, I’d answer, I’d like life in Britain to
be a bit like Tate Modern, that is, to project qualities of
civic-mindedness, of community, a kind of democratic
quality and a life that’s still quite dignified: the idea that
something could be for everybody, but of very high quality.
It’s a building which interestingly fuses the past and the
present; which is something that British life is very cut up
and divided about. So that’s a building which is not just a
good building but it’s almost like a good person, a good,
modern, British person.
