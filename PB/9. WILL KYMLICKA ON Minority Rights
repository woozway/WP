Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites

WILL KYMLICKA ON
Minority Rights

David Edmonds: The idea that individuals should have rights is now
deeply embedded in western liberal democratic culture. But the idea that
groups—such as, say, immigrants, Muslims, Jews or Sikhs, native
Americans or French-speaking Canadians—the idea that they should
have special rights seems incompatible with the kind of equality that
liberals advocate. Nonetheless, Canadian philosopher Will Kymlicka
believes that liberalism and group rights are compatible—in fact, not
just compatible but in certain cases, he says, liberalism actually requires
granting distinctive rights to groups.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we want to discuss is minority rights.
The obvious questions to ask are: ‘What is a minority?’ and ‘What kind
of rights are we talking about?’

Will Kymlicka: In my work I’ve generally focused on three
different types of groups. First of all indigenous people; I’m
from Canada so it’s a very important issue for us. Secondly,
historical, regional, linguistic minorities like the Quebecois
or the Catalans or the Flemish. Thirdly, immigrant groups.
Each of these groups has valid claims for certain kinds of
rights against the state, but they’re quite different and we
need to look at them separately.

NW: So you’re saying these kinds of groups have special rights distinct
from ordinary citizens’ rights?

WK: Yes. I think all liberal democracies have to respect a
basic catalogue of civil and political rights. But a multicul-
tural liberal democracy goes beyond that to recognize
certain group-specific rights that are intended to remedy the
particular types of injustices that these different groups often
suffer from.

NW: I can see there’s going to be an immediate problem: how do you
identify which groups are eligible for this treatment?

WK: There are hard cases and easy cases. Before we get to
the hard cases, we should recognize that there are certain
distinct patterns. For example, indigenous people in the New
World settler states—Canada, Australia, United States, New
Zealand—share a lot in common. They face fundamentally
different challenges from those facing recent immigrants or
regional minorities. This threefold typology of groups is
actually more effective than you might think—most
minorities in the West do fall under one of these familiar
types. Of course, there are some hard cases. For example, the
Roma in continental Europe do not fit into any of these three
categories. But even here it helps us understand what’s
distinctive about the Roma case to figure out how the Roma
differ from these three patterns.

NW: So we’ve got the three patterns—what do you want to say about
what rights each group has?

WK: As I say, my idea is that we think about rights as
remedies for predictable types of injustices. So the first
question is: what’s the nature of the relationship between the
state and these groups? How have these groups come to be
incorporated into the state, and what are the standard kinds
of injustices that arise in that relationship?

The case of indigenous people is perhaps the clearest
case—they were colonized. That’s a gross injustice. They
were pushed off their lands, they were denied the right to
maintain their own language, their own legal and political
institutions were suppressed. So, it’s not difficult to see that
there were predictable injustices in that historic colonial
relationship, and to see how respecting land claims and
self-government rights help to remedy that injustice.

Compare that with the very different case of immigrant
groups. They’re not necessarily the victims of historic
injustice because they’re relatively recent arrivals. But there
are still issues about how they become incorporated into the
state. Western democracies have rules in place which state
that in order for immigrants to become citizens, and to be
able to parti cipate fully in society they have to go through a
number of steps and tests. There are now citizenship tests in
Britain, as in most western democracies. In these tests,
immigrants are required to learn the national language, to
learn something about the history and culture of society, and
they’re expected, or required, to participate in institutions
that were set up by the historic community. I think many of
these requirements are quite reasonable, but we have to ask,
what are the ways in which immigrants are disadvantaged or
stigmatized, perhaps unintentionally, by the expectations of
the larger society? And I think there are many contexts in
which multiculturalism policies for immigrant groups can
overcome these injustices, and make it easier for them to
participate more fully and equitably in society.

NW: Do immigrants as a whole form one group or are there sub-
sections of immigrant groups: Polish immigrants, Chinese immigrants,
and so on?

WK: There are some generic issues that apply to all immi-
grants. For example, wherever immigrants come from, the
state has a duty to assist them in learning the national
language. If you’re going to require that immigrants learn the
national language to become citizens, you have to enable and
assist them to learn the national language. There are other
kinds of claims that are much more distinctive to particular
immigrant groups, and one of the most important is the issue
of racism. White European ethnic groups in Britain or in
Canada or Australia have an easier time than more recent
racialized minorities, and different policies are needed to deal
with racism. One of the interesting issues in multiculturalism
in all of these countries is this: we have one set of policies that
are primarily about the accommodation of cultural diversity,
religious diversity, or linguistic diversity for immigrants; then
we have another set of policies that are about fighting racism
and discrimination. And I think both of those are equally
important parts of a larger multiculturalism.

NW: What are the special rights that we should accord to specific
minorities in a liberal society?

WK: I don’t like the term ‘special rights’ because that
immediately makes people think that they are privileges.
So in the case of indigenous people, as I said before, it’s primarily
in relation to land and self-government, but also rights with
respect to the control of natural-resource development on their
traditional territories. In the case of historic regional minorities,
such as the Quebecois or Catalans, official language rights are
an absolutely critical part of the accommodation of sub-state
nationalism. In the case of immigrant groups, the most
well-known and controversial examples concern exemptions
from existing laws to accommodate distinctive beliefs, such as
exempting Sikhs from motorcycle-helmet laws or dress codes or
accommodating dietary requirements in schools and hospitals
and so on.

NW: But one consequence of this sort of treatment is surely the
suspicion that they’re getting preferential treatment?

WK: That’s the standard criticism. Much of my work has
been devoted directly or indirectly to trying to answer that.
Part of the answer is to remind people how much existing
institutions are a massive system of preferential treatment
for the majority. It’s their language which is the official
language; it’s their history which is taught in schools; it’s
their religion that’s accommodated in the public holidays;
and so on. So much of what we’re trying to do through
multiculturalism policies is to accord the same level of
respect and accommodation for minorities that majorities
take for granted and that they achieve through the normal
majoritarian processes.

NW: I was thinking about New York, where there are many immi-
grants, and after a generation or two they’re not necessarily recogni-
zably part of an immigrant population, they’re just New Yorkers.
At what point does a new immigrant cease to be accorded the distinctive
minority rights?

WK: Firstly, there’s very strong evidence that the children
and grandchildren of immigrant groups continue to have a
strong attachment to their ethnic identity. Sociologically
speaking, this attachment to their ethnic identity is quite
thin or even symbolic. It doesn’t determine what their jobs
are going to be; it doesn’t determine who they’re going to
marry; it doesn’t determine where they’ll live. But they
still take pride in being a Greek-American or a Japanese-
American. It’s important that that sense of ethnic identifi-
cation be honoured and respected, for example, through
kinds of multicultural education. That’s not something that
goes away with the first generation. To respect people’s
ethnic identities is an enduring requirement in a multi-ethnic
society.

Other kinds of multiculturalism are more transitional.
Some policies are primarily for that first generation or the
children of immigrants who, for example, may need special
assistance for learning the national language. That’s no
longer a relevant issue for the second or third generation.
Multiculturalism for immigrants has both these transitional
elements and enduring elements.

NW: Where do you set the limits of what rights you accord a minority
group? I’m thinking, for instance, of the sort of groups which might come
from a country where polygamy is tolerated, or where there are arranged
marriages.

WK: My conception of multiculturalism is an explicitly
liberal one. I evaluate claims for minority rights on the basis
of what I take to be the core liberal values of individual
freedom: equality of opportunity or equality of life chances,
and democratic citizenship and effective participation. So,
obviously, many claims that groups might make do not
enhance individual freedom or equality of life chances or
democratic participation, in which case they’re not compat-
ible with the liberal democratic constitution and I’m not
interested in defending them.

NW: You’ve worked with the Canadian Government—can you say a
little bit about what it was like being a philosopher advising politicians?

WK: Well, I found it very encouraging. I was pleasantly
surprised at the extent to which bureaucrats and policymak-
ers are deeply concerned with the normative and conceptual
nature of their work. In their day-to-day work they are
incredibly busy, they don’t have time to sit back and think.
But they’re aware of these deep, philosophical questions such
as ‘What does fairness require in a diverse society?’ and
‘What are the limits of toleration?’ These are issues that they
wish they had time to think about in a more principled or
conceptual way, rather than as an ad hoc response to new
surprises or crises. If a philosopher can come along and
frame those issues in a way that makes sense to them, they’re
very interested—I haven’t had people reacting with: ‘Well,
you’re just an ivory-tower philosopher, what you’re talking
about is not relevant for what we’re doing.’

NW: Has it changed the way you do philosophy?

WK: I’m very interested in the relationship between case
studies and theories. From the start of my academic career
I have been frustrated with the way many of my colleagues
operate. They think that the right way to do normative
political theory on these issues is to sit in a rocking-chair
somewhere and try to deduce from one’s mind what a group
is, what culture is, what identity is, and then what rights
groups or cultures or identities have. I think it’s much more
helpful to take some actual examples of groups making
claims, and figure out what exactly is the claim they’re
making and how specifically does it relate to values of
freedom, democracy, equality, and so on. So, having interac-
tion with a government has exposed me to a lot of interesting
cases that I wouldn’t have known about otherwise; and it has
also reaffirmed my commitment to that way of proceeding.

When philosophers think about the question of cultural
diversity, they almost immediately jump to the conclusion
that the real issue, the heart of the issue, is cultural relativ-
ism: are there universal values or are our values culturally
relative? That debate has been going on for 2,000 years and it
will go on for another 2,000 years. But it doesn’t actually help
us grapple with what’s distinctive about contemporary
debates around multiculturalism. We’re living in a specific
historical moment—we can think of it as a post-civil-rights
epoch, starting in the 1960s—defined by the emergence of
new political movements and new political claims, which
include ethnic minorities as well as women, gays, people
with disabilities, and so on. I think the task of the political
theorist is to figure out what’s new and distinctive about
these kinds of collective identity claims.

NW: I’m intrigued by that. Could you give an example of one of these
new claims?

WK: What this issue has exposed is that liberal democracy
for the last 200 years or so has been intimately linked to the
nation state. That’s a demonstrable, empirical, historical fact.
But most liberal political philosophy has not acknowledged
it. One of the interesting things about the multiculturalism
debate is that it helped to highlight the extent to which
liberalism has actually been predicated on or dependent on
nationhood. This is not necessarily a problem in itself—on
the contrary, the ability of liberal values to take root in
society has often been enhanced by the fact that they’re
linked to ideas and ideologies and institutions of nationhood.
On the other hand, this linkage has clear potential to be
unjust to these different kinds of minorities who do not share
the characteristics that are assumed to define the nation.

the characteristics that are assumed to define the nation.
So we have an inherited practice of liberal democracy
which is linked (even, I might say, addicted) to nationhood,
and it’s now being challenged by a series of minority groups,
many of whom share those liberal democratic values but feel
that they have been excluded or stigmatized or disadvan-
taged by the link between liberalism and nationhood. So, the
task we face at this historical moment is to find either a new
conception of nationhood, or a way of decoupling liberalism
from nationhood. That has generated a fascinating debate
which has very little to do with the perennial question of
cultural relativism.

NW: You’ve been talking about a liberal position. As I understand it, a
classic liberal position focuses on individual rights, not group rights.

WK: Any liberal theory must include firm protection of a
basic catalogue of individual, civil and political rights.

That’s absolutely true. But the question is whether that
catalogue of universal individual rights can and should be
supplemented with group-specific minority rights. I actually
think that this perception that liberalism is only compatible
with individual rights is an artefact of the Cold War. There’s
a story to be told about how liberals like Karl Popper and
Isaiah Berlin redefined the liberal tradition so that its single
most defining feature was this kind of individualism, so as to
maximally distinguish it from ‘collectivist’ Communism.
Actually the liberal tradition is much more capacious, histori-
cally, in combining individual and group rights, and we can
learn from that history.

NW: Here’s a pessimistic comment: since 9/11, many people think
multiculturalism is doomed as a project.

WK: It’s absolutely true that people’s openness to the claims
of minorities depends on a basic level of existential security.
If people think that minorities are a threat to that existential
security, the space for multiculturalism often disappears. But
we need to be careful in jumping to conclusions about the
relationship between multiculturalism, understood as this
set of distinctive rights, and the threats of radicalism, say
amongst Muslim youth. If you look across the western
democracies, we have cases of ‘home-grown terrorism’; this
has emerged in countries that have multiculturalism policies
like Britain and Canada, but also in countries that don’t, like
Spain or Germany. All of these countries have arrested
groups who were planning various acts of violence. So
multiculturalism clearly is not the cause of radicalism: the
problem is found whether or not there are such policies.
The key question is whether we can use multiculturalism
policies to help address that problem: are there ways in
which multiculturalism can be used as a way of addressing
the sources of anger or resentment or hatred? There’s
probably more we could do about that.

One of the standard criticisms of multiculturalism in
Britain has been that it was traditionally focused almost
exclusively on race as the organizing concept, to the neglect
of the distinctive issues raised by religion, and particularly
Islam. So an important challenge is whether we can find a
form of multiculturalism that doesn’t just deal with issues of
racialization, but also is a form of multiculturalism in which
Muslims can find a home.
