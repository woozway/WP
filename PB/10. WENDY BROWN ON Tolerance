WENDY BROWN ON
Tolerance

David Edmonds: Who could possibly be against tolerance? Isn’t
tolerance the mark of a civilized society, the quality that allows
individuals with widely different lifestyles and values to rub along
together in peace? Isn’t tolerance unquestionably a good thing? Wendy
Brown, Professor of Political Science at UC Berkeley, wants us to be a
little more sceptical about the concept—though she tolerated a cross-
questioning from Philosophy Bites.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we are going to discuss is tolerance. You
have chosen the word ‘tolerance’ rather than ‘toleration’; could you just
explain why you prefer it?

Wendy Brown: When ‘toleration’ is used, it almost always
refers unconsciously, if not consciously, to the Reformation
and the regime of toleration that was inaugurated in
response to the problems of Protestant sects, bloody religious
wars, and the persecution of sectarians and dissidents. Today
the word ‘tolerance’ is used in a much broader, wider way. I
have set ‘toleration’ aside because it almost always calls up
that particular historical formation and problematic, and
because ‘tolerance’ is the word that almost everyone uses
today to talk about the problem we’re about to talk about.

NW: What got you thinking about tolerance?

WB: What really sparked my interest in the problem of
tolerance was how widespread its use became in the 1990s.
One might have imagined that the concern with tolerance as
we have understood it over the last several hundred years
could have more or less died out. That is to say, tolerance
emerged in the West primarily as something concerned with
religious belief, where there was one hegemonic religion
and then a set of other beliefs that had to be dealt with in
some way or another by that hegemonic religion. Instead of
dying out, what you see in the 1990s is an enormous renais-
sance in the use of ‘tolerance’; it is used to talk about
everything from political regimes to ethnicities, to cultures,
to sexualities. It is also used to talk about religious beliefs—
but not primarily so.

NW: Tolerance is perhaps the prime virtue of a liberal society, and most
people will have a prejudice in favour of tolerance: it seems to be the basis
of any kind of multiculturalism, of any thriving society which recognizes
the diversity of people within it. How could you be against tolerance?

WB: I am not against tolerance, but I do want to submit it to
close scrutiny, to ask what the concept is actually doing. The
commonplace view is that tolerance is an absolutely benign
virtue. Every smart, sane, civilized, human being has to be
for it. So I start there and I ask: ‘Okay, so what is this benign
virtue?’ If you actually look closely at the etymology of
tolerance, what do you see? Across every disciplinary field
in which it is used, from mining, to minting, to engineering,
to pharmaceutical research, to social life, tolerance is always
about the management of some undesirable element or
foreign body, invading or taking up residence within the host.
It is about an element that one would rather not have to deal
with—whether the ‘one’ is a scientist or a social theorist or a
political actor. Tolerance is always about managing some
object of aversion, which is different, and different with a
stigma—different as a problem. The host is neutral. The host
is normal. The host is regular. The tolerated object is always,
in some ways, problematic.

For example, in my country, there’s a great history, or
mythology, of Northern tolerance towards blacks compared to
Southern bigotry. Certainly such tolerance seems generally
preferable to slavery, lynching, de jure segregation, and the like.
But tolerance is not freedom, equality, or justice—rather,
tolerance is what it sounds like, suffering someone’s existence
rather than dealing with them violently. Moreover, tolerance
means permitting someone to exist within a certain set of
conditions, a certain set of constraints, and a certain set of
limits on behaviour. It is this that I wanted to explore: why we
were getting so much talk about tolerance in the 1990s in the
United States, in an increasingly multicultural Europe, and in
worldwide civilizational discourse. Why was tolerance
becoming the mantra at the United Nations, when, peered at
closely, one realizes that that word is always being used to
handle something or someone that is abject, subject or
subordinated, and to do so in a very particular way.

NW: We surely need some kind of tolerance just to live with other
people, don’t we?

WB: Absolutely we need some, just to get along with our
neighbours and our colleagues, sometimes even our chil-
dren. We have to tolerate certain things; we have to tolerate
music we don’t like, cooking-smells we might prefer didn’t
exist, behaviours of certain people on public transportation,
and so forth. We think the best thing to do, and I agree with
this, is to handle these things without making a fuss. But that
kind of tolerance is very different from what I am talking
about. That is a kind of tolerance, at a personal level, that is
unquestionably essential to just getting along in the world.
What I am concerned about is when tolerance is raised to a
political principle and used as a substitute for discourses of
justice, equality, or even freedom. What I am suggesting is
that when it is raised to the level of a political principle of
that sort, it usually cloaks the kinds of powers that are at
issue. It cloaks inequalities; it even sometimes substitutes for
egalitarian projects.

NW: Could you give an example just to clarify what you mean there?

WB: Sure. I’ll give you an example that comes out of the
2008 US elections. Some of your listeners/readers may be
aware that on many of the state ballots there were proposi-
tions challenging the legality of gay marriage. All of these
propositions succeeded. That is to say, in the four states in
which they were on the ballot, in each case, gay marriage
was rendered illegal—usually by declaring that marriage
should be officially defined as a relationship between a man
and a woman. Now, the reason for mentioning this is that
what many people said in treating these propositions—and
indeed what presidential contender John McCain and
vice-presidential contender Sarah Palin said—is, ‘we are not
for gay marriage but we are for tolerance [of gay people]’.
This is also exactly what George Bush had said during his
period as president.

If you step back from this for a second, you realize that what
they are saying is ‘we are not for marriage equality, but we are
for tolerance’. So, quite literally, what is being suggested is that
certain people will be tolerated instead of made equal. And
that is the way tolerance has operated for most of its history in
the modern West: it is always a kind of substitute for equality,
or supplement to equality. Now, again, that is not the worst
possibility if the alternative is extinction or persecution or
death or exclusion from basic rights. Again, I am not against
tolerance, but I do think that our tendency to just get sleepy
and happy when we hear the word ‘tolerance’ is a problem.

NW: What you are doing, in a way, is drawing attention to a word, a
word that has smuggled within it a kind of patronizing attitude to the
people who are tolerated. That occurs not just within a state or within a
country, but actually in terms of a country looking outwards at other
people.

WB: Correct. One of the things that happened during the
course of my research on tolerance was the event that has
come to be known as 9/11. Right after the attacks on the
World Trade Centre and the Pentagon, ‘tolerance’ shifted
focus and direction as a discourse. Instead of being primarily
a domestic discourse concerned with multiculturalism,
suddenly the United States became, in political discourse,
identified with being a tolerant nation and the West became
identified as a tolerant civilization. The ‘enemy’ was
conceived as intolerant, authoritarian, or otherwise barbaric.
Instead of just having the tolerating magnanimous host and
the tolerated subject, now we have something else: we have a
discourse in which there is the tolerant West and the intoler-
ant East, or tolerant Christianity contrasted with the intoler-
ant world of Islam.

What is interesting about the way that works is that the
tolerant West understands itself as relentlessly tolerant,
and nothing but tolerant, in relationship to a picture it
draws of another civilization, as relentlessly intolerant.
Now, one of the things that is wrong with that picture is
that the West, of course, has a history of crusades and
slavery and Nazism and all kinds of other things which are
just whitewashed by this discourse. The other problem is
that this self-portrait by the West literally permits a kind of
cultural and civilizational supremacy that licenses a
certain kind of imperialism. We are tolerant, we are for
tolerance, and we have to exterminate intolerance wherever
we find it. We practise tolerance until we come up against
the so-called intolerant, at which point we are allowed to
topple it, or launch an imperial war against it, or other such
things. So one of the worries I developed about the early
period of the twenty-first century was the way that our
commitment to tolerance was actually being used to
underwrite imperial wars.

NW: Surely America just is more tolerant than, for instance, Saudi
society?

WB: To some degree, yes. Certainly there is a general
commitment to religious freedom and other liberties,
principles of the sort enshrined in the Constitution and
also accepted by, let’s say, 75 per cent of Americans.
Certainly there is a practice and value of tolerance that we
associate with American society that we don’t associate
with select practices of Islamic religion and some Islamic
societies. Once we have said that, though, we have a
problem. Tolerance is not simply being declared as a good
thing; it is being declared as our essence and their lack. It is
being depicted as governing and saturating us, absent in
them. And that is where there is simply a falsehood being
circulated.

American society is not relentlessly tolerant, and the very
people using tolerance to launch certain kinds of wars—and
I have in mind here the Bush–Cheney administration—are
proudly intolerant in certain other respects. Moreover, what
is worrisome here is that tolerance is being used as a justifica-
tion for not tolerating another regime, culture, or religion.
Tolerance isn’t just a discourse of power, it is also a discourse
of conditionality; that is to say, you will be tolerated unless
and until you behave in certain ways, at which point I will no
longer tolerate you. That is the way tolerance discourse was
being used in the post-9/11 period: it was being used to anoint
the West as inherently and essentially tolerant, which then
justified our intolerance of anything we designated as
intolerable. I know this sounds tautological but that is
exactly the way the logic of tolerance works in its civili-
zational mode.

NW: But surely every political term is loaded. If we use the term
‘freedom’, we mean ‘freedom in certain respects’. If we use ‘equality’, we
have to specify equality of what.

WB: That is right. The difference is, I think, that most
people—even people not in academic fields of political
philosophy or other kinds of social criticism—know that
about ‘freedom’ and ‘equality’. We know that these words
are protean; they shift their meanings in different discourses
and in different political systems. We know that ‘freedom’
and ‘equality’ also tend to carry problems of power with
them. We rarely defend notions of absolute freedom or
absolute equality and we argue a lot about both their nature
and their relation. In other words, there is a known complex-
ity that goes along with these terms and a known need to
investigate: what do you mean in a particular case by
equality? Do you mean social equality? Economic equality?
Political equality? Legal? Formal? And so on. Tolerance
doesn’t tend to get that scrutiny. It more often tends to be
treated as an inherent good, one that is warm and pleasant,
which is an alternative to nightmarish wars, persecution,
death, or terrible strictures in societies. What I am suggest-
ing is that we need to give it exactly the kind of scrutiny that
we give those other terms.

What worries me about the way that tolerance has come
to operate in the last couple of decades in the West is that, in
addition to being a civilizational discourse, it is often a
substitute for projects of egalitarianism and freedom. It
sometimes represents a retrenchment from those more sub-
stantive projects or a gloss for their absence. One of the things
I am aiming to do is call attention to the fact that tolerance is
not equality, it is not freedom. It is something else.
