GOD, ATHEISM, AND
THE MEANING OF LIFE

DON CUPITT ON Non-Realism about God

David Edmonds: Don Cupitt has been described as ‘the most radical
theologian in the world’. His 1984 BBC television series The Sea of
Faith, and the book of the same name, gave birth to a movement that is
still thriving, and his other books, particularly Taking Leave of God,
have been both praised and pilloried. Praised by those who see him as
making sense of belief in God in the postmodern age; pilloried by
religious traditionalists. Central to his controversial views is his
non-realism about God.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we are going to focus on is non-realism
about God. Could you say something about what you mean by
non-realism?

Don Cupitt: Normally non-realism is the view that things
don’t exist apart from our knowledge of them and the ways
in which we describe them: everything takes shape and gets
fixed in our conversation. So I am giving up the ideas of a
pre-existent self, world, and God, quite apart from human
belief, human commitment, and human descriptions. God
doesn’t exist apart from our faith in him.

NW: Most people live their lives thinking that there is a world out
there that exists independently of their perception of it. Beyond the
window out there is a part of Cambridge which I can’t see but I am confi-
dent exists and will continue to exist after my death—completely
independently of me. So would a non-realist say it doesn’t exist apart
from me?

DC: No. For ordinary practical, everyday purposes, we can
take realism for granted. But remember our knowledge of
the world, our vision of the world, and our values are
constantly being renegotiated in our conversation, constantly
changing. All scientific theory has a limited life, so we
shouldn’t suppose that the world exists out there perma-
nently and for ever, quite independent of our conversation.

NW: So my interpretation of what is there is actually part of what
makes it be there: the way that I understand the world determines what
it really is.

DC: Yes. I think people are getting familiar with the idea
that our whole vision of the world and our values change
profoundly from decade to decade. Most people of my age
will remember that they have had to reconstruct themselves
very considerably during their own lifetime; they don’t kill
animals with the same lack of compunction as when they
were young, and they have different attitudes to women, and
perhaps to race as well. We have all had to rethink as the
world has changed around us.

NW: Now, you are famous particularly for having argued that the
idea that God exists, as some kind of being out there to be discovered by
people, is just wrong.

DC: That is right, yes. In the traditional popular picture
based on the Book of Genesis, God has put us into a fully
furnished house, a complete, ready-made world. What is
more, remember that in Genesis the first human beings were
made as adults, they already somehow had language at the
moment of creation and they saw a complete, ready-made
world. Of course it didn’t happen like that! Think how the
world must have looked to our ancestors, as they began to
emerge from their animal background and become con-
scious. By their conversation amongst themselves, they had
to learn to structure their experience and build up a picture
of the world around them. We have done this for ten
thousand years and more, and now we are where we are
today. We ourselves had to build up our own picture of the
world, by degrees, from within, through our own conversa-
tion. That is how the human race came into being.

NW: Many Christians will say: ‘Yes, but God pre-existed humanity
and created humanity and we are gradually discovering more about
God.’ What you seem to be saying is humanity pre-existed God and
came to a conception of God. That sounds almost as if God doesn’t exist.

DC: We invented all the theory. We gradually built up our
own picture of the world, and we have also gradually evolved
our own religion and our own values. I would say Christian
theology was just about right for the historic period between
about the first and the seventeenth centuries, during which it
flourished. But gradually, as the world has changed in
modern times, we have become more aware of our own
world-building activity and we have begun to see that we
have got to move on. We can’t stick for ever with a late
medieval world-view.

NW: You were and continue to be a Christian priest, but what you are
saying sounds completely unorthodox.

DC: Yes, but then Christianity itself has a history. All truth
has a history. All truth is developed within the human
conversation. Christianity managed to keep up to date until
the late seventeenth century, but it has had trouble adapting
since then. So now, in a very curious way, you can see
Christianity’s continuing development better outside the
church than within it. The church looks increasingly as if it is
falling into the past, trying to keep alive a world-view that
the rest of us have now departed from.

NW: Yet many evangelical Christians, for instance, do believe in the
idea of an objective God out there in the world and believe sincerely that
there will be an afterlife when they will meet that God.

DC: Yes, I think you can still maintain belief in God. But
remember, since the decline of the old world-view it has
becoming increasingly hard to say what we mean by God. I
think, myself, that as the philosophy of Plato has gradually
lost influence, popular belief in God has got more and more
anthropomorphic, as if God were nothing but a very large
human being, probably of the male sex (though some would
say female).

It is that sort of terribly crude idea of God that I am protest-
ing against. I am saying that our modern critical type of
thinking changes everything. By the way, there is one modern
version of Christianity, namely the Quakers’, that does still
exist and flourishes. The Quakers believed from the seven-
teenth century onwards that we were moving over from the
church phase in the history of Christianity to the next epoch,
the kingdom phase. God is internalized within each believer:
they became a society of friends, not a hierarchical church
with sacraments. And the Quakers, of course, contributed
enormously to the development of modern ethics.

NW: Just to get this clear: when we were talking about Platonism,
what you mean by that, presumably, is this idea of an abstract ‘Form’ of
God. In Plato the Forms are more real than the phenomenal world that
we experience, but they don’t exist in the same way that chairs exist.

DC: Yes. Plato took that strange, hierarchical vision of the
universe quite literally—which is a bit of a problem. But it
is broadly true that, up till about 1700, when people talked
of God they all agreed on what they were talking about,
namely a great public object that was the same for every-
body, and that God was an infinite, eternal spirit, all-
powerful, all-knowing, without any passions, and simple.
What has happened is that the popular idea of God has
become far too anthropomorphic; it is biblical poetry,
but it can’t be literal truth—it has lost its philosophical
background.

NW: Yet there is a tradition of a personal God in the New Testament
isn’t there?

DC: Yes, but on the whole most of the Bible is too poetic
and anthropomorphic in its language about God. We don’t
know how far all those metaphors can be true. Think of the
picture of Jesus Christ seated at the right hand of God. Do
you really think you can send up a rocket and find huge,
human-looking figures sitting on chairs above the bright
blue sky? Of course you don’t. We have no longer got a
philosophical language in which we can say what is really
out there. That is why the old realism has died. We can’t
imagine, for example, how God can be both personal and
absolutely timeless. How can we have a relation with a God
who cannot change? When I was young, people really said in
response to every personal misfortune: ‘Why has God let
this happen to me?’ I hear less of that nowadays. I don’t think
people really expect that God will protect them from road
accidents or cancer or a plane crash. They accept that life is
contingent, there is sudden misfortune. We shouldn’t
suppose that the whole nature of things is interested only in
my well-being—it isn’t.

NW: At one point in your philosophical development you argued that
‘God’ refers more to human ideals than to anything else.

DC: Yes, I suggested we should see God as rather like what
the Americans call your dream, or your guiding star: the
ideal towards which your life is oriented, the ideal you live
by. Sometimes I have spoken of God as the pearl of great
price (a parable told by Jesus explaining the value of the
Kingdom of Heaven). In that case, we might see God as a
spiritual goal of life, but not as the ontological foundation of
life. Remember, in traditional Christian language God is
both our beginning and our end, our alpha and our omega.
Now the beginning side, I drop; I don’t think we should any
longer look to God to explain why there is a world at all, or
why the world works in the way it does. But I do think we
can keep the idea of God as a goal of life: God as a personifi-
cation, or a symbol, of love, of perfection, of a kind of
timeless bliss that we do occasionally glimpse.

NW: If there isn’t a God objectively out there, how can you ground
your Christian ethics on anything? Because traditionally, Christian
ethics has been based on the guarantee of a real God’s existence.

DC: That is right, and in Catholic theology you should live
with a hope of heavenly reward, you expect a pay-off. I say
that nowadays everything is contingent and changing; we
are transient. We shouldn’t expect any external endorsement
for our beliefs and values. We have to love them and pursue
them for their own sakes. In my own view, the basis of
Christian ethics is simply human kindness, kinship: our
response to our fellow human being. The world is our
conversation amongst ourselves. Everybody has a contribu-
tion to make. Everybody must chip in to say their own piece.
So for me, just the movement of life is the primary reality,
and it is in that that I situate my values. I think, myself, that
Jesus was a humanist ethical teacher: he wanted to get rid of
the old dependence of ethics on sacred law and tradition and
instead to found ethics simply on our response to our fellow
human being. And notice Jesus criticizing religious law,
when he says, for example, that the Sabbath was made for
man, not man for the Sabbath; that is to say, treat religious
law purely instrumentally. If it helps you, follow it, if it
doesn’t, disregard it. He doesn’t want us to base our values
and our ethics on religious authority. He thinks that is
oppressive. Rather, love for our fellow human beings should
be the basis of our lives.

For centuries, perhaps for millennia, people have looked
for some sort of absolute foundation outside human life, in
terms of which knowledge or values or the reality of things
could be justified. I think, since the twentieth century, we
have come to see that everything is transient; we can’t look
for any external guarantees for anything in human life.
There is only our own commitment to the human enter-
prise, our love for each other, our keeping of the conversa-
tion going. So I believe in jaw-jaw not war-war, in human
conversation kept as open as possible as the best way to
arrive at a consensus world-view, consensus about truth and
a decent consensus about values.

NW: One charge that can be levelled against that position is that it
collapses into a kind of relativism: a moral relativism where every
different world-view has equal value and there is no position from which
to choose between them. Is that your position?

DC: No, I hope that our conversation will gradually show
that some religions, some values, some works of art, are
better than others. There’s a useful parallel with art
criticism. We now live in a culture which tolerates many
different styles in the arts, but we still have art criticism.
We can still think that some artists are better than others,
and so on. It is true that I am a sort of relativist; but I still
believe in conversation as the best way to arrive at a
consensus-truth.

NW: To those who say we don’t need conversation because we know
the truth—how could you persuade them that they were wrong?

DC: Well, I would challenge them to defend their views in
conversation with me. I hope the mass of the human race
won’t retreat into various kinds of fundamentalism—I would
hate that.

NW: Many people have said that you are really an atheist in disguise.

DC: The word ‘atheism’ has different meanings. Remember
the famous line of the nineteenth-century German philoso-
pher Ludwig Andreas von Feuerbach: ‘What today is
atheism, tomorrow will be religion. What today is religion,
tomorrow will be atheism.’ That is to say, the way we
perceive these terms changes; at one time the Christians
themselves were called atheists, because they wouldn’t
acknowledge the official gods of the Roman Empire. I don’t
mind people saying my outlook is non-metaphysical. I believe
in life, but otherwise I am not metaphysical. I don’t think
there is anything outside life. Everything is fleeting, includ-
ing me; all our beliefs are transient. We must simply fight for
what we believe to be true and good.
I am not an atheist in the sense of being a dogmatic
atheist, because that presupposes that there is one clear fixed
notion of God in possession of the field. And that is not quite
true: there are many ideas of God current nowadays, some of
them better than others.

NW: We discussed the idea that God might be an ideal we live by, but
you’ve changed your views slightly on that now.

DC: As I have got older I have become more and more
committed to writing books, expressing myself, producing
language, mingling with others, getting devoted to my
grandchildren, and so on. I now think I love the human
enterprise more and more. I am getting more and more
sociable. In which case, I am inclined to equate God with life
and just commitment to life and enjoyment of life. That to
me makes a lot of sense. So, in my recent books, I have
pointed to the extraordinary extent to which people have
transferred the old talk about God to life. Do you know that
near the end of War and Peace Leo Tolstoy has Pierre say, ‘Life
is God, and to love life is to love God’? So that has become a
very common idea in modern speech. For example, suppose
a young person dies tragically—nowadays, people don’t say
when they praise her, ‘She loved God’, they say ‘She loved
life’. So in my own thought, commitment to co-humanity
has become my religion. Perhaps I am now a post-ecclesiasti-
cal Christian.
