Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites

ETHICS

PETER SINGER ON 
Animals

David Edmonds: In 1975 Animal Liberation was published: in
hindsight, a seminal work of philosophy, marking the birth of the
modern animal rights movement—though its author spoke not of rights
per se, but, as a utilitarian, in terms, put crudely, of maximizing
interests or happiness. The Australian author is now at Princeton and
arguably the world’s most famous philosopher. He believes that some
animals have a higher moral status than some humans and that our
disregard for animal suffering is a deplorable moral blind spot. He also
has contentious views on euthanasia, abortion, on infanticide, on civil
disobedience, and on how much we should give to charity. But we spoke
to Peter Singer about how humans treat animals.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we’re going to focus on is the ethics of
using animals, both as food and in research. Before we start, it’s
probably best to get clear about what you understand by a ‘person’,
because you distinguish a ‘person’ from a ‘human being’.

Peter Singer: A person is someone who is aware of their
own existence over time, aware enough to realize that
they’re the same being who lived previously and who can
expect to live into the future. So most human beings are
persons, but none of us was born a person. Newborn infants
are not persons. And some non-human animals are persons,
but not all non-human animals are persons.

NW: So what kind of non-human animal might be a person?

PS: A chimpanzee, for example, is probably aware of its
own existence over time. So I think there’s good evidence
that chimpanzees are persons.

NW: What about adult humans who lack the mental capacity to think
about their own past as their own. Would they not be persons?

PS: I think they’re no longer persons. They may have been
persons, and we may choose to respect the wishes they had
when they were persons. But there comes a time—at least if
the body outlives your intellectual capacities to such an
extent that you can no longer be aware of your past or even
the idea that you have a future—when you would cease to be
a person.

NW: Somebody reading this who is not a philosopher will say ‘Well
look, you can define a person, you can define a human being, so what?’

PS: Absolutely, that’s quite the right reaction. Definitions
don’t show anything, normatively. But I think the idea of a
being who can envisage his or her own future is morally
significant, because if you compare the wrongness of killing
a being who is capable of having some anticipation of the
future, some desires for the future, perhaps even some
projects to complete in the future, and you kill such a person
who wants to go on living, you’re doing something wrong to
that person which is something you’re not doing if you kill a
being who is not fully a person and who can have no wishes
or hopes for the future which could be cut off or thwarted or
frustrated. So the concept of the person points to something
that is relevant in the specific context of the wrongness of
killing.

NW: To me, the real issue with animals is whether they suffer or not.
All kinds of animals are capable of suffering even if they don’t have a
conception of their life continuing.

PS: I totally agree. You brought up the topic of persons, not
me. The major issue about animals and how we treat them is
that they’re capable of suffering. I don’t think it’s about the
wrongness of killing them.

NW: It’s interesting that many of your critics focus on descriptions of
a situation where you’re playing off a human being who’s less than a
person against an animal which is a person.

PS: I think that’s a tactic. It’s quite an effective tactic with
some audiences. They caricature my views by saying that, on
my view, animals deserve more consideration than humans
do. I don’t think that is true in general, although it is true
that there are some rare situations where a human is so
intellectually disabled or incapable of understanding things
that I would, other things being equal, give preference to the
non-human animal. The animal could then have a greater
interest in going on living, or in not suffering in a certain
way. But that’s really completely irrelevant to the vast
majority of cases in which we are interfering with animals,
for example, when we’re producing them for food in factory
farms. Then it’s not even necessary for me to say that they
have the same status—let alone a superior status—to
humans. All I need to do is point to the fact that we’re
inflicting unnecessary suffering on them. That should be
enough to show that what we are doing is wrong, given that
we’re not doing this in order to save human lives but just
because we like to eat a certain kind of food.

NW: Another concept that’s important in your work is ‘speciesism’,
the idea that it’s somehow akin to racism to treat other animals,
non-human animals, in a way that we wouldn’t treat human beings.

PS: It’s not so much that we’re treating animals in a way we
wouldn’t treat human beings. Because sometimes that may
be appropriate, given that they have different interests,
different capacities. Sometimes we should treat them
differently, just as we sometimes quite properly treat small
children differently from the way we treat older human
beings. The point about speciesism is that we give less weight
to the interests of beings who are not members of our species
simply because they are not members of our species. We are
not looking at their individual characteristics, nor at their
capacities, or what’s good for them, or bad for them. We just
say: ‘Well, they’re not members of the species Homo sapiens,
therefore we can use them for our purposes, our ends; we
don’t have to treat them as if their ends mattered.’ Whereas if
we are dealing with a human being, no matter what the
mental level of that human being, we say that that human
being’s life is sacred, he or she is an end in itself, we must
respect the dignity of that human being, and so on.
That’s speciesism—just to take the species in itself as
determinative of moral status.

NW: But isn’t that simply a good rule of thumb? When you see
another person, you tend to think of them evolving over time, with a
sense of themselves and a capacity to feel pain, in a way that a fish, like
a haddock say, doesn’t.

PS: Well, for one thing not all of our encounters with
animals are with haddock. For another, while I agree with
the first part of what you said, that the human is likely to
have more of a self-conception, more of an awareness of
itself as existing over time, than an animal, I’m not so clear
that human beings are going to have a greater capacity to
suffer. We know that non-human animals have some
senses that are more acute than ours. Eagles have better
eyesight, dogs have a better sense of smell, and so on. It’s
not at all impossible that because of their need to live in
sharp contact with the world animals have capacities to
feel pain that are just as acute or more acute than ours. We
shouldn’t take it as a rule of thumb that humans always
suffer more than animals, and certainly not that human
suffering matters more, which is really the point about
speciesism.

NW: Now, the two main ways in which many of us use animals are as
food, or in some kind of experimentation, possibly for scientific research,
possibly research in cosmetics. You’re a utilitarian; that is, you’re
interested in maximizing happiness in some sense, or maximizing the
interests of sentient beings—and that’s how we can tell whether
something is right or wrong.

PS: That’s correct: whether, all things considered and in the
long run, you’ve done what’s best in the interests of, or will
best satisfy the preferences of, all sentient beings.

NW: But doesn’t this just complicate everything? Most of us, most of
the time are most interested in other human beings. If you start including
all kinds of animals, how do you work out what to do?

PS: It does complicate things. Just as, if you’re a white
European in the eighteenth century, it complicated things to
have to consider the interests of Africans. That interferes
with your profitable trade in slaves. But even though it’s
more complicated, it’s still something we ought to do. Now it
is true that the calculations can’t be done with any precision
at all, but in some situations we can make rough compari-
sons and sometimes it’s pretty clear that we’re inflicting
more suffering than is justified by the benefit that we’re
getting out of it. One of those situations is factory farming.
In factory farming, we confine animals in conditions that
for their entire lives make them miserable. They can’t satisfy
their basic needs, neither physically in terms of moving
around, exercising, having comfortable bedding, nor socially
and psychologically in terms of mixing with the right kind of
social groups suited for their species. Laying hens might be
suffering for their entire lives. Breeding sows might be in
stalls too narrow for them even to turn around, let alone
walk, for most of their lives.
We have to ask: what do we get out of this? Well, we
produce food a little more cheaply. But we are not starving,
and we can afford to pay a little more for our food. I don’t
think there’s much doubt that that’s not something that can
be justified if we give equal consideration to the sufferings of
the hens and the pigs.

NW: But isn’t that just an argument for eating free-range meat rather
than factory-farm meat?

PS: It’s an argument that says, a clear-cut case of something
wrong that we do to animals is factory farming. You were
asking about how we make complicated comparisons across
species, and so I answered that factory farming is something
that we can definitely say is not justified. That’s not to say
that if you get into other forms of farming you may not still
find things that are undesirable and you might still reason-
ably come to the conclusion that we shouldn’t be doing that.
But the case against these other forms of raising animals will
not be as black-and-white as the case against factory farming.

NW: And if you take the example of eating game—animals that have
lived in the wild that have been killed very quickly, with gunshot
perhaps—that, presumably, is more morally acceptable than eating
free-range meat which has to be taken to be slaughtered?

PS: I think that’s generally true. It will depend on the
particular circumstances, including how reliably you can put
a bullet through the brain of an animal and kill it instantly
rather than have it wounded and escaping. But if you are a
good shot in an area with ecologically sustainable hunting,
it’s better to go hunting for your meat than to go down to a
supermarket for it.

NW: What I like about what you’re saying is that it’s so reasoned.
Everything is consistent; you’re looking for an argument that makes
distinctions based not on how you feel about killing or animal suffering,
but about what the implications are, rationally. Most people I’ve met
who are vegetarians have a complete sense of revulsion about eating
meat, or harming animals in any way, which they might not be able to
justify rationally. So perhaps they’re not moral vegetarians?

PS: Some of them may be aesthetic vegetarians: that is, they
are repulsed by the idea of killing an animal. And I agree that
there is something that does repel me about it. Even if I
convince myself by the argument that we were just having
that in certain circumstances it’s acceptable to shoot deer, I
still wouldn’t like the idea of watching that beautiful animal
suddenly drop dead and be reduced to a carcass and a piece of
meat. But speaking as a moral philosopher I have to consider
whether this is just a ‘Yuk!’ response that we might have to
other things that actually are quite defensible or justifiable,
or whether there’s a serious ethical reason for not doing it.

NW: So do you believe that we should all be vegetarians?

PS: Almost all, I would say. If there is somebody who is
living a traditional indigenous life, whether it’s an Inuit who
survives by killing fish, or Australian aboriginals who are
still living a traditional life that might involve occasionally
killing some animals, I would not presume to say to them
that they have to abandon their way of life and go and live in
a city where they can earn money and buy their food in a
supermarket. That’s a somewhat different situation from our
own.

NW: So in a sense, those who aren’t vegetarians are immoral to a
degree. But how immoral is it to eat meat?

PS: Compared to what? Yes, it’s normally morally wrong.
None of us is perfect, though. I don’t consider everything I
do is perfect, but I think part of living a morally good life is
having concern for the consequences of what you do. That
includes having concern for animals who are affected by
your actions. These things suggest that most people in
developed nations—where they have a wide choice of
nutritious food and can easily nourish themselves well
without eating meat—would be living a better life if they
were vegetarian.

NW: For me that’s a very classical conception of philosophy—that you
don’t just think it, you live it.

PS: Absolutely. I wouldn’t still be doing moral philosophy if
I thought it was just a theoretical game. When I was a
teenager I was fascinated by chess, and I used to spend time
looking at chess problems, ‘white to move and mate in two’,
that sort of thing. It was fun and intellectually stimulating,
but I wouldn’t want to spend my life doing it. There are
things that are more important. And sometimes I think
people doing philosophy almost reduce it to the level of
solving chess puzzles.

NW: I live in Oxford, where there’s a large building just been built
specifically to do research on animals. That’s another way in which
animals are frequently used and that causes them suffering. But it’s
defended in terms of the outcome. There are other ways of surviving
because you could be a vegetarian. But how could you do medical
research without doing animal experimentation?

PS: There’s plenty of medical research being done without
animal experimentation. A lot of medical research is done
through trials with humans, and we’ve also greatly increased
the amount of research we can do using tissue cultures (the
growth of tissues and/or cells separate from the organism),
computer simulations, and various other alternatives to
using animals. This area of animal research has grown over
the last thirty years, partly as a result of pressure from the
animal movement, and that’s a very good thing. But I’m not
going to say that there’s nothing we can learn from research
using animals.

NW: So you’re not an absolutist. You think there are situations in
which it could be morally acceptable to use non-human animals for the
benefit of human beings?

PS: It could be. I certainly couldn’t rule that out as a theo-
retical possibility. But I would have a very high bar to be
cleared before you could go ahead and do that. And one of
the reasons I would have a very high bar is that I think the
whole institutional practice of research on animals has grown
up with the speciesist prejudice that I mentioned before: that
animals really don’t count, or not very much anyway. And,
therefore, for many medical researchers, it’s not a problem to
say ‘Get me fifty rats’ or ‘Get me twenty dogs’.
That’s why I don’t want to justify the general practice of
animal experimentation and I certainly don’t want to justify
or defend what happens in the building you described, a
building that I know is very controversial in Oxford. Because
I expect what is going on there is that scientists are carrying
on their business as usual in which the interests of animals
are not given anything like the weight that the interests of
humans at comparable mental levels would be given.

NW: When you started writing about the suffering of animals,
speciesism, and so on, that was a very radical position to take. Things
have evolved since then. There are many more people who go along with
your reasoning. Do you think there will be a time in the future when
people will look back and say ‘I can’t believe they were eating meat,
I can’t believe they did experiments on chimpanzees’?

PS: I hope so. At least I am fairly sure they’ll say: ‘I can’t
believe they were locking animals up in factory farms so
they didn’t have room to walk around or turn around.’ And I
do hope they’ll say: ‘I can’t believe what they were doing to
chimpanzees.’ Indeed, we’ve almost got to that point now
with chimpanzees. You look back on some of the things that
were done not that long ago, twenty or thirty years ago, and
people are quite horrified that those experiments were
permitted. So we are making progress. I very much hope
that we will continue to do so.
