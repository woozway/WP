METAPHYSICS AND MIND

TIMOTHY WILLIAMSON ON
Vagueness

David Edmonds: When does a man who’s losing his hair become
bald? At what hour, or minute, or second, does one become middle-aged?
When do a number of grains of sand become a heap? These questions are
all linked to a set of paradoxes, known as Sorites paradoxes (the name
‘Sorites’ is from the Greek word soros, meaning heap). They occur
because many concepts, like our concept of a heap, are vague. The very
definite Tim Williamson, Professor of Logic at Oxford University, is
certainly a leading expert on vagueness.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we’re focusing on is vagueness, which
philosophers have discussed for several thousand years. What is
vagueness?

Timothy Williamson: Vagueness has to do with borderline
cases. The word ‘red’ is vague because for some shades on
the spectrum from red to orange it is not clear whether to
count them as red or not. Vagueness is not the same thing as
uninformativeness or unspecificity, although they are often
confused with each other. For example, if you ask me how
many people were at a party and I say ‘There were at least
three people and at most 297’, that’s a very uninformative
answer, but it is scarcely vague because it’s pretty clear in
what circumstances it is true and in what circumstances it is
false. Whereas if I said ‘About twenty people were at the
party’, that’s actually more informative because it at least
tells you that there were more than ten and fewer than
thirty. But it’s vague because the word ‘about’ is vague.
If in fact fifteen people were at the party, it’s unclear
whether I’ve spoken truly or falsely. So it’s that kind of
unclarity in the boundaries of what you’ve said that consti-
tutes vagueness.

NW: So what’s the difference between that and ambiguity?

TW: A good example of ambiguity is the word ‘bank’,
which can mean financial bank or river bank. But when
someone uses the word ‘bank’ they’re using it in one or other
of its different senses. That does not imply that they are
using it vaguely, simply because it has another irrelevant
meaning that you would find listed separately in the diction-
ary. Not all ambiguity is vagueness, and not all vagueness is
ambiguity. The mere fact that the word ‘red’ neither clearly
applies to some shades of colour nor clearly fails to apply,
doesn’t imply that the word ‘red’ is ambiguous. That
unclarity concerns the sense with which the speaker is
currently using the word, not the existence of some other
sense.

NW: Now the classic way that philosophy students meet vagueness is
in the paradox known as the Sorites paradox. Could you just outline
what a Sorites paradox is and why it’s philosophically interesting?

TW: The classic example of a Sorites paradox, from which
the word ‘sorites’ derives, is the paradox of the heap. It starts
with a thought experiment. Imagine that you have a heap of
sand and then you take one grain away from it. Ask yourself
whether you still have a heap of sand. The obvious answer
seems to be ‘Yes’. But the heap just consists of a finite number
of grains of sand, say 10,000, so if you keep applying that
principle, that if you take a grain away from a heap what’s
left is still a heap, then eventually you’ll be driven to the
conclusion that there’s still a heap when only two grains are
left, then when only one grain is left, and finally when no
grains at all are left.

NW: And why is that a paradox?

TW: Well, obviously that there’s a still a heap when there’s
only one grain left, or none, is a crazy conclusion. You might
think that you can get out of the problem by simply denying
the original principle—the principle that when you take a
grain away from a heap what’s left is still a heap—even
though that seemed very plausible when we did the thought
experiment. But the problem is that if you deny that principle
then, by standard logical reasoning, you are forced to say that
there must have been a point when you had a heap and you
took a grain away and there was no longer a heap. And the
paradox in that is that it seems very hard to accept that just
one grain can make a difference between having a heap and
not having a heap, given the loose, vague way in which we
use the word ‘heap’.

NW: Another similar example often used in this area is baldness.
Somebody with a full head of hair isn’t bald, but as you gradually lose
hairs you move towards baldness. Intuitively, there must be a point at
which you become bald. Or perhaps there isn’t? Could one hair really
make a difference?

TW: In fact this kind of paradox arises for almost all the
concepts we use in ordinary thinking. For example, take the
concept ‘tall’. If somebody is growing millimetre by millime-
tre, at what point do they become tall? If you are becoming
richer, penny by penny, at what point do you become rich?
There’s just no end to these paradoxes. One can construct
them to order, as the ancient Greeks realized.

NW: So actually vagueness is a concept which is important to us in
just about every area of our lives.

TW: All our language and thought is riddled with vague-
ness. Although it is always there, most of the time we don’t
need to think about it—but sometimes it is practically
important to do so. We’re all familiar with the way in which
politicians phrase their promises in vague language so that
they can wriggle out of them later. We need to remember the
vagueness of their language in order not to be tricked.
Sometimes vagueness can have a more positive role. For
example, sometimes opponents can end a conflict by
deliberately being vague about what exactly they are
agreeing on, so that they can both back down a bit without
losing face. Problems of vagueness often arise when we have
to apply laws or rules or instructions. Suppose that you are
trying to apply a law which says that you shouldn’t harm
your neighbours. You have to think about questions such as
‘What degree of loudness of the music you’re playing
constitutes harming your neighbours?’—and this involves
thinking about the vague word ‘harm’.

NW: Is it that our natural language is necessarily imprecise in a
number of ways and we should just live with this?

TW: It’s inevitable that our language and the concepts with
which we think are, to some extent, vague. We can do
something about it. For example, when we’re framing laws we
can make an effort to use more precise language than we
ordinarily do, and sometimes we can clarify concepts by
defining them. But none of this really eliminates vagueness,
because even the language that we use in trying to clarify
concepts will itself be vague. For example, if you try to
define what it is for somebody to be ‘bald’ in terms of the
number of hairs on their head, then you have to consider
questions like how the hairs are arranged on their head, how
developed something has to be in order to count as a hair,
and so on. So there is never any complete escape. We can
reduce vagueness but we can’t eliminate it altogether.
Anyway, as the example of baldness suggests, it wouldn’t
always be a good thing to eliminate vagueness because
sometimes vague language is much more convenient for us
than very precise language. Even the languages of science
and mathematics are vague in subtle ways.

NW: But for a concept like ‘tall’, you could just say ‘I stipulate
anybody over 6 feet is tall’.

TW: Not even that works. For example, you still have to
decide whether you’re measuring from the top of their hair
or the skin, how to deal with people who habitually have bad
posture, and so on. There’s no end to further questions of
that kind. For practical purposes they are ridiculously
pedantic, but nevertheless if they’re not all answered, then
there’s still vagueness.

NW: How, then, do philosophers deal with this problem of vagueness?

TW: Many philosophers think that what vagueness shows
is that the standard principles of logic, as used for example in
mathematics, are not applicable to ordinary language and
thought. Those principles of logic are based on the idea that
when you make a statement it’s either true or false, and not
both: the principle that there are just those two possibilities
is known as ‘bivalence’. Many philosophers think that the
principle of bivalence doesn’t work for vague statements. So
if you say that something is a heap, then according to them
that need not be either true or false, it might be neither.
Perhaps we have to postulate a continuum of degrees of
truth between perfect truth and perfect falsity, with all sorts
of intermediate degrees in between—that’s the starting-point
for the approach known as ‘fuzzy logic’.

NW: Do you accept that view?

TW: No. I hold that the dichotomy of statements into the
true and the false applies even to vague language and
thought. What philosophers have theorized as cases where
something is neither true nor false, or has an intermediate
degree of truth, are really cases where it is either true or false
but we can’t know which.

NW: So you’re saying there is a truth of the matter about whether
somebody is bald or not, even though we might not know it?

TW: That’s right, yes.

NW: What’s the argument to support that?

TW: The basic argument is just some elementary logical
reasoning to the conclusion that either someone is bald or
they are not bald, because otherwise they are neither bald
nor not bald, and so both not bald and not not bald, which is
a contradiction. Then, if they are bald, it is true that they are
bald, and if they are not bald, it is true that they are not bald,
so either way there is a truth of the matter. Obviously we
have no idea how to find out which of those two possibilities
is the truth. However, the principles of reasoning I’ve just
used there, although accepted in standard logic and in my
view fundamental, are not uncontroversial—every funda-
mental principle gets denied by someone or other. So in
order to build a convincing case, one has to look in detail at
the alternative proposals that people have made for how to
reason with vague words and concepts. What I’ve argued is
that those alternatives do a much worse job than standard
logic at handling vagueness and Sorites paradoxes.

Probably the best-known alternative to standard logic is
fuzzy logic, which many people have heard of because it is said
to be used in the design of some washing-machines and other
household appliances. But when you follow out the conse-
quences of fuzzy logic it says some very implausible things.
For example, imagine two identical twins, Fred and Ted, who
are going bald in exactly the same way. Whenever one loses a
hair, so does the other, their scalps are exactly the same shape,
and so on. Suppose that we have reached a point when they
are both borderline cases of being bald. They are right in the
middle: so the fuzzy logician says that it’s exactly half true and
half false that Fred is bald, and exactly half true and half false
that Ted is bald. Then it’s an implication of fuzzy logic, given
the way the theory works, that it’s also half true to say ‘Fred is
bald and Ted isn’t.’ But that’s a completely false description of
the situation, because it’s quite clear that if one of them is bald
then so too is the other. There is no truth at all to the claim
that one of them is bald while the other one isn’t.

NW: So if you take the example of someone who seems to be losing
their hair, as our former prime minister Tony Blair seems to be doing at
the moment, there’s a definite answer as to whether he’s bald or not at
any moment, even if we can’t decide—we don’t have full access to the
information that would determine that and we don’t even know what
the criteria are.

TW: Yes, even if we could be bothered to count the exact
number of hairs on Tony Blair’s head we still wouldn’t
necessarily know whether he was bald or not. But either he is
or he isn’t. Obviously that doesn’t mean that it’s a fact of any
great scientific importance whether he’s bald or not. Even if
the cut-off point for bald comes with, say, 9,000 hairs, perhaps
we could have had a different concept shbald, just as useful as
the concept bald, but with the cut-off point at 9,001 hairs
instead. That wouldn’t have mattered, but the concept that
we actually have draws a line in one place, even if we could
equally well have had a different concept that drew a line in a
different place.

NW: So if we adopt your view of baldness the benefit is that we
preserve the more valuable conventional logical system where we accept
that a statement is either true or false.

TW: Yes, that’s one benefit. It gives an answer to the
question, ‘How should we reason with vague concepts and
vague language?’ And the answer it gives is one that enables
us to use quite powerful methods of reasoning; whereas
typically the effect of alternative views is that they inhibit
reasoning so that it’s difficult to draw any definite conclu-
sions from your premises.

NW: And is there a wider significance? Could it affect people’s daily
lives?

TW: One sort of effect it might have on people’s daily lives
is this. We are constantly encountering situations in which
human beings have to interact with computers, and increas-
ingly we want human beings to be able to speak to comput-
ers in their own everyday words, saying what they have to
say in ways that come naturally to them, rather than just
typing in a ‘Yes’ or a ‘No’. If computers are going to be able
to react sensibly to what people say to them, speaking
English or whatever their native language happens to be,
then we have to be able to program computers to handle
vague language. In order to do that we need some kind of
formal understanding of what the principles of reasoning are
that hold for vague language. But my account of vagueness
also changes the way in which we think about our own
knowledge and ignorance. Often we tend to think of our
ignorance as being either accidental or the result of great
scientific mysteries. On the view I’m defending, knowledge
and ignorance are inextricably bound up with each other.
Our ordinary ways of gaining knowledge have intrinsic
limitations. Although there is a logical framework within
which the world has to be seen, we also have to accept that in
thinking about the world we can’t get very far just by relying
on formal rules. There is an ineliminable role for good
judgement. But at the same time it would be a mistake to
react to that by becoming completely sceptical, because
mixed in with all the ignorance there is genuine knowledge
as well.
