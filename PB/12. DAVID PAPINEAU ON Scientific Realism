METAPHYSICS AND MIND

DAVID PAPINEAU ON
Scientific Realism

David Edmonds: Most scientists now believe that there are
unobservable entities in the world. These entities can’t be seen,
touched, smelt, or felt. In that sense, they’re not like ordinary objects:
tables or tomatoes or television sets. But, at least according to scien-
tific realists, they’re just as real as tables or tomatoes or television sets.
David Papineau is a tangible professor of King’s College London.

Nigel Warburton: We are focusing on scientific realism. Could you
just explain what scientific realism is?

David Papineau: Scientific realism is the view that the
world as described by scientific theories really exists and we
know about that world. In particular it is concerned with the
world of unobservables: the world of electrons and atoms,
molecules, viruses, radio waves, and so on—things that we
can’t see or otherwise sense. So whether we really do know
them to exist or not is a contentious issue. In the area of
philosophy of science, scepticism is a serious option: many
philosophers of science hold that, while there no doubt is
an unobservable world, we have no way of finding out
about it. This contrasts with the philosophy of everyday
medium-sized physical objects. There we talk about scep-
ticism in Philosophy 101, but this is just an exercise. There
the question is: ‘How can we refute the sceptic?’ But nobody
really thinks that we don’t know about tables and chairs and
everyday objects. However, in philosophy of science quite a
lot of serious people think we really don’t know about the
unobservable world, and they believe that scientific theories
are just convenient, useful myths that aren’t reporting on
reality.

NW: So the sceptic says that unobservable things, which scientists
talk about, are actually convenient fictions, whereas the realist says
these things actually exist?

DP: Exactly, and this issue has a very interesting history. At
the start of the Scientific Revolution—with Descartes, Boyle,
and running up to Newton—the scientists were serious
realists about the observable world. They were very optimis-
tic. In fact the defining characteristic of the Scientific
Revolution was that its adherents were mechanical philoso-
phers. They thought the whole world was a machine.
Observable things were composed of lots of small little bits,
and it was the behaviour of the bits, their interactions, that
explained what we observed. And they set out to try and
figure out what these bits were. They were materialists: they
thought the whole world was made up of complicated
arrangements of matter.

The trouble was that in the seventeenth century they
didn’t get very far. They found out quite a lot of interesting
things—for example, that air exerts pressure and if you go up
a mountain the pressure reduces—but they found it difficult
to figure out the mechanism responsible for that. They
weren’t sure whether the air was made of little springs like
you get inside a biro, or some kind of elastic solid that you
could walk through, or whatever—and they didn’t have any
clue about how to resolve this. Newton figured out that
gravity obeyed the inverse square law, but when the question
arose, ‘exactly why do bodies move in this way?’, no mecha-
nistic explanation could be derived. Newton himself
famously said ‘Hypotheses non fingo’, ‘I feign no hypotheses’,
by which he meant that he thought it wasn’t the proper
business of science to speculate about all these unobservable
mechanisms—and speculation is what he thought it would
have to be. This is a perfectly natural point of view. How
could we possibly figure out that tables or bits of wood are
made up of all these tiny particles that behave in such-and-
such specific ways? It is completely flabbergasting that we
now take ourselves to know such things. This was the view
that came to be adopted after the best part of a century of
trying. From the eighteenth century onwards the scientists
gave up and came to regard any such microscopic hypoth-
esizing as perhaps interesting speculation, but certainly not
seriously-to-be-believed theory.

NW: So you are saying that scepticism arose principally through the
failures of science?

DP: Absolutely; and, as I have just explained, it seems to me
a perfectly natural position to adopt, especially in the
absence of any convincing serious scientific theories of the
relevant kind—in other words, any serious theories of
unobservables.

NW: What happened in the nineteenth century to change all this?

DP: Well, what happened is that for the first time some
serious testable theories were put forward about the unob-
servable microscopic mechanisms responsible for what we
observe. In particular there was the atomic theory of
matter—which developed as people got clear about chemis-
try and the difference between elements and compounds and
mixtures, and the laws of constant combination by mass and
volume. If you think about that, the natural explanation to
give is that bits of matter are made of little particles that
combine in certain simple whole-number ratios. And then
that combined with the kinetic theory of gases and the
kinetic theory of heat. So by the end of the nineteenth
century there was an overwhelming amount of evidence in
favour of the atomic theory. The philosophers and the
philosophical scientists were still persuaded by Newton that
this couldn’t be serious, but it became so manifestly serious
that slowly the working scientists all joined up and by the
early twentieth century they had all become realists. They
thought it must be possible to find out about the unobserv-
able world—because we manifestly have succeeded in doing
so. Of course a few philosophers remained unpersuaded.

NW: Essentially what these scientists were doing was hypothesizing
about causes on the basis of visible effects.

DP: Exactly. And that leaves a couple of openings for
philosophers who aren’t convinced of scientific realism to
remain sceptics. Interestingly, they don’t nowadays call
themselves sceptics. They use a numbers of terms—they call
themselves instrumentalists, or empiricists, or constructive
empiricists. In truth, all these people who have doubts about
scientific knowledge of the unobservable world are just
sceptics—although adding perhaps a little bit about how the
theories are useful instruments for making predictions,
useful for suggesting new research, and so on. But basically
they agree with the eighteenth- and the early nineteenth-
century scientists that knowledge of the unobservable world
is not possible.

NW: So why exactly do they think that?

DP: Well, there are two powerful and pretty influential
arguments against scientific realism. One is the argument
from the underdetermination of theory by evidence: the
thought here is that, given any set of observable phenomena,
there will always be a number of alternative explanations for
those phenomena. So imagine the phenomena of light—
angle of incidence equals angle of reflection, the law of
refraction (Snell’s Law)—all those things can be explained
either by the wave theory of light or, given a little bit of
work, by the particle theory of light. So you have got two
different explanations, two different possible causes, for the
same observable phenomena. How do you decide between
them? You can’t, the sceptic says. So that is the argument
from the underdetermination of theory by evidence.

The other argument is called ‘pessimistic meta-induction
from past falsity’. Sorry if that sounds a bit of a mouthful, but
it is easy enough to understand. It is the argument that says
that, if you look at past scientific theories, they all turn out to
be wrong, so our present theories are probably wrong too.
You can see it is pessimistic and it is a meta-induction because
it is inducing from the past failures of science to present
failures.

NW: Okay, let’s take those one at a time. First the underdetermina-
tion of theory by the data. That sounds quite plausible. You made a good
case for it with the example of light. There are two alternative explana-
tions, both of which fit the observable facts.

DP: Good. But it is not as powerful an argument as it looks
at first sight. Those two theories—the wave theory and the
particle theory—they are both on the cards, given the initial
data. The initial data can be explained equally well by both
those theories. But in most cases—and, in particular, in this
case—it is possible to figure out some prediction that is made
by one of the theories and not by the other. And then you can
test it. That is called a crucial experiment. In this case, the
wave theory predicts that you will observe certain interfer-
ence phenomena in certain situations and the particle theory
doesn’t have any natural explanation of that. When we try it,
we find interference patterns. So the particle theory is out,
and the wave theory wins. Now that doesn’t fully settle the
underdetermination-by-evidence argument, because one can
always come up with some other theory that will once more,
alongside the wave theory, explain all the phenomena,
including the interference phenomena.

For example, here are a couple of silly theories. One says
that there isn’t any unobservable world, there is just the
observable world, and it just so happens that in certain
situations you observe interference phenomena. So that is a
kind of ‘atheistic’ theory of the data—there is nothing behind
the observable world. Here is another theory: there are lots
of little green men running around, much too small to see,
and they are arranging everything in just such a way as to
make the wave theory look right. Now those are both
coherent and consistent theories, and they explain the data.
But of course nobody takes them at all seriously. In effect, to
argue from those kinds of theories is just to say that it is
never possible to infer anything that goes beyond the
evidence, and that in other contexts is not a principle that is
adopted, and it shouldn’t be adopted in science. So the truth
is that, given any two serious theories, you can normally
decide between them by doing some more experiments.
Then you will be left with some crackpot theories, but I don’t
think anybody should seriously think that crackpot theories
undermine our knowledge of the atomic theory of matter,
say, or the wave theory of light.

NW: So what you are saying is, usually when there are two compet-
ing theories, running side by side, it is not that both are in a sense true
or anything like that. There is a right answer; it’s just that we haven’t
quite worked out how to find out the crucial experiment that will
decide what it is. But when we do decide it, science moves on. We ditch
one of the theories. The trouble is that then you have got this pattern of
rejecting theories over and over again—each theory is set up to be
knocked down.

DP: Right. So that brings us to the other argument, that is,
the pessimistic meta-induction from past falsity. They aren’t
complementary arguments. Interestingly, sceptics about
scientific knowledge tend to run either one or the other.
You can see why: the underdetermination argument is that
there are too many good theories; whereas the pessimistic
meta-induction argument is that there are too few good
theories—in fact there aren’t any.

So we should turn to the second argument. That is a very
serious argument. If past theories all turn out to be false then
it would be foolish to feel that somehow our present theories
must be true. So realists have a number of options. One thing
they might do is say: ‘Look, the past theories aren’t just
outright false: they were wrong in a few details, but basically
they had a lot of truth and they were approximately true.’
For example, the wave theory of matter isn’t exactly right,
because now with quantum theory we know that light
moves in wave-like particles—photons. But still, the
fact that light obeys the equations of wave motion and
so on—that was all okay—so the theory was approximately
true.

NW: Is approximate truth good enough for realism? Is it good enough
to say something really is there, if we are just approximating?

DP: Well realism, schmealism. If realism is supposed to be the
view that our current scientific theories are exactly true, that
realism is no good. But we have a position that says our
current scientific theories no doubt have an awful lot of truth
in them, and we have every entitlement to be confident about
that. Perhaps that is not the realism that you might have
hoped for in the first place—but given the evidence of past
scientific theories, it looks like the right position to adopt.

NW: But this isn’t a historical relativism about scientific truth, is it?

DP: No, no, just the opposite. Relativism would be the
position you would adopt if you were persuaded by the
pessimistic meta-induction: each historical period’s theories
were believed by the people of the time, but from a more
objective, timeless point of view you could see that all these
theories had no real authority, they were all out of tune with
what reality was like. So people thought they were right but
they weren’t, or aren’t. That is the relativist point of view.
The point of view of the realist who resists the pessimistic
meta-induction is that all these theories have some good
truth in them—not every detail of the theory, but lots of
truth—and that builds up, and we should trust what the
scientists say to that extent.

NW: Does that then mean that there can’t be scientific revolutions in
which the whole way of doing science is radically transformed?

DP: Well, if you bought the story about approximate truth
that would mean there are no scientific revolutions: new
theories get built on the old ones. But I haven’t yet given you
convincing reasons to support that view. If you look at the
history of science, there are plenty of cases which don’t seem
to fit the approximate-truth story. If you think of classical
mechanics, Newton being replaced by Einstein, well in some
ways what Newton’s theories said were approximately true—
for example, what Newton says about objects at low veloci-
ties. On the other hand, what the theory says about objects
moving at velocities close to the speed of light is wildly
wrong. So there the realist probably has to adopt a different
strategy. What a realist should say is that the original
pessimistic meta-induction is just too crude, even if you put
to one side the issues of approximate truth.

There are some areas in which it seems that new theories
do often radically overthrow old ones. For example, when we
look at general theories of space-time cosmology, we do seem
to get these kinds of revolutions. The moral is that we should
take current cosmological theories with a pinch of salt. We
have current general relativity, big bang, and so on—but it is
quite possible that in fifty years’ time we will think reality
has thirteen dimensions and what we observe is just a
low-energy four-dimensional projection of it, and it will seem
to us that what we currently believe is all wrong.

But one shouldn’t infer from that, that the atomic theory
of matter is all wrong. There are cases and cases. There are
some areas of science—I mentioned general cosmology, but I
could add psychology and certain parts of social science—
where there are all these flip-flops all the time. And then
there are other areas of science—chemistry, parts of
engineering—where people build steadily on the past
theories. The moral is obvious: there are some areas of
science where we can have a high degree of credence in the
theories and other areas of science where we ought to be
pretty sceptical.

NW: We should be sceptics about some areas of science, and realists
about others?

DP: Absolutely. And if you think that I am giving up on
what I promised you earlier—scientific realism—well that is
too bad, because it seems to me the position I have outlined
is obviously the sensible one. If you think about the question
in the first place: ‘Should we be realists about science, about
everything put forward by people who claim the authority of
scientists?’ Well, why should we? We should be realists about
good theories and we should be sceptical about dodgy ones.

NW: The difficulty, of course, is finding out which are good and
which are dodgy.

DP: Yes, right. So one thing I have pointed to is past track
record in different areas of science. Cosmology doesn’t have
that great a track record, but post-1800 chemistry has a
terrific track record. But one might try and back that up by
looking at something else, which is maybe the reason some
areas have a good track record and other ones don’t. Some
areas have plenty of evidence and other areas are working
with very thin evidence. Here is another example: palaeo-
anthropology, the history of the evolution of the hominid
lineage over the past 5 million years. People keep on chang-
ing their minds—once it was that we descended from
Australopithecus—and that was all wrong—and now we have
got five new species. This is because they are struggling with
a few bits of tooth and bone to figure out a lot of detailed
stuff from 5 million years ago. So it is not surprising that they
are guessing. Contrast this with the wealth of evidence that
developed in the nineteenth century: chemical combinations,
kinetic theory, and so on. If you go and look at all that
evidence, it would be very, very difficult not to be completely
convinced of the atomic theory. This difference in track
record reflects another thing which gives us independent
reason to be more serious about some theories than others—
namely, that some theories have a lot more evidence in their
favour than others.

NW: The example you just gave was a historical one—about
something that happened in the past. But if we are doing history you
could say there is just not enough evidence to decide between competing
theories. Nonetheless, most people are going to say, well surely something
really did happen nevertheless. There is a truth to the matter, even if we
don’t know what it is.

DP: Good, yes. So that takes us back to the beginning. I
have been articulating the strengths and weaknesses of
scientific realism, by which I mean not just the view that
there is an independent reality, but that plus the view that we
can know about it. The view that there is an independent
reality and we can’t know about it is scepticism. So of course
there is a fact of the matter about what happened in the past,
including what happened in the palaeoanthropological past,
but the interesting issue here, which is the one we are
debating, is, can we find out about it?

NW: Just to round this up, it sounds to me as if what you are saying is
that the history of science is actually the history of getting closer to the
truth.

DP: Well, I did qualify that by saying in some areas it is not
obvious that that is so—but in other areas, yes it is. I would
like to invoke a very fine Australian philosopher, David
Stove. Stove said, look at what we have discovered, look at
what we know about chemistry, look at what we know
about diseases, look at what we know about engineering—
people who say that all scientific theories are no doubt false
is talking through their hat. And that is what I think too.
