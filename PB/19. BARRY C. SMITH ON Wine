Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites

AESTHETICS

BARRY C. SMITH ON
Wine

David Edmonds: If philosophy drives you to alcohol, don’t expect any
respite: for booze is no longer a philosophy-free zone. Barry Smith, from
the Institute of Philosophy, has come up with a cunning ruse to combine
his profession and his passion—philosophy, with wine. Barry has edited
a philosophy book on wine, Questions of Taste. So what philosophical
issues does wine throw up? Here’s one. Are there objective standards of
wine, or is my opinion just as valid as yours? And here’s another, related
question: when I drink wine, and savour its look, smell, and taste, am I
identifying independent characteristics of the wine—characteristics
that I, the taster, am—as it were—discovering in the wine itself? Or is
the taste of wine just inside me?

Nigel Warburton: There’s a story about the philosopher Jean-Paul
Sartre, and how he got into phenomenology: he’s sitting in a café looking
at a glass of water, he says ‘Look, I can actually do philosophy about this
glass of water in the café.’ You’ve gone one better, you’re doing philoso-
phy about a glass of wine. Can you tell me how you got into the
philosophy of wine?

Barry Smith: Yes. Philosophers have always had a lot to say
about wine—Plato’s book The Symposium started with
philosophers sitting there using wine to lubricate the
talk—but they haven’t often thought philosophically about it.
And it seemed to me that it was a very good topic. Here’s
something which we take great pleasure in, something that
has a history, and a culture, something which we might
think has a value for us in our lives, and yet something
which, when we taste it, seems so special and personal and
intricate a part of our experience that we wonder if we can
share it with other people.

NW: Well, the first thing I think about wine is taste. How do you get
from my personal experience of what wine tastes like to me to something
that seems more objective, like a judgement that this particular wine is
good?

BS: Yes, I think taste is a very complicated thing. We talk
about taste as something that people can educate, they can
learn to be discriminating in their taste—and here we’re
talking about judgement and refinement, qualities that have
to do with sensibility. But taste itself, as a sensation, is
something that seems to go on in our mouths, in us, quite
literally. It seems to be a very personal experience. How
could it be shared with anybody else? The way we bridge
those two is by finding another use of the word ‘taste’; and
when we use it, perhaps we’d best use it in the plural: ‘tastes’.
I think there are tastes in wine that are different from the
sensations we have when tasting it. And I think tastes are
things about which we can make judgements; indeed, for
which there might even be standard of tastes.

NW: Can you actually be right about what a wine tastes like?

BS: The idea that we can’t be right and that everything is
purely subjective, in the sense of there being only how it
appears to me, here and now, is mistaken. We all know that
if we’ve just brushed our teeth, or sucked a lemon, we’re not
going to get the real taste of this fine Cabernet Sauvignon
you’ve brought me to drink. So we know there are some
conditions we have to be in, and the wine has to be in, in
order to get things right. That’s already a start in getting rid
of the idea that there are only just my sensations at a
moment.

NW: So the taste of wine isn’t just in the wine: it’s about my relation-
ship with the wine, the kind of sensors that I bring to bear on the wine as
I put it in my mouth?

BS: Yes, but there’s also a fact about how the wine tastes
that might elude you if you’re not in the right condition. It
might also be that in certain wines, if they’re ‘closed down’,
as we say, where they’ve gone to sleep, you can still taste, if
you’re an expert taster, that all of the wine’s parts are there,
and they’re just not performing properly. That makes us
think that a taste is something out there, something we try
to reach for, something we don’t always get our tongues on,
rather than thinking that taste is just a sensation occurring
in us.

NW: I’m getting a bit confused now: if I had to summarize your view,
should I be saying that the taste of wine isn’t objectively out there in the
wine, nor is it completely subjectively in me?

BS: Perhaps it’s a relationship between the wine and me.
But in saying that, that doesn’t mean that it’s only available to
me. If this is a relationship between a wine and certain
sensations and experiences I can have, then maybe it will
affect other people similarly. Just as we suppose that the
colour red is for us a certain experience, a certain way
things look, then if we’re near enough alike in our colour
vision the very same objects will give us the same experi-
ences. So I’m hoping that the very same wines will give you
and me the same experiences and these are really shared
experiences.

Tasting is actually a very complicated experience. It
involves smell, it involves touch—the texture of the wine in
your mouth—it involves the taste; and we don’t always pay
attention to all of the parts of this enormously complex
product at once. But if you ask me, did you get the fig, did
you taste the pear, I can look back and think, yes, even
without taking another sip. I can suddenly realize that the
flavours you were talking about were there, but not attended
to. So you can bring out, or bring to my attention, aspects of
my own experience, that I had briefly overlooked.

NW: I’m always intrigued with the language that’s used by wine-
tasters. Some of it seems ordinary language, I can understand when
there’s a smell of lemon, a citrus smell, that’s a smell that I’ve smelt—so
it’s actually a reference to something that’s in my portfolio of recogniz-
able smells. But some of the language seems to be quite idiosyncratic,
almost exclusive to those who speak wine language.

BS: That may be right. Tasters can be more or less exotic in
their uses. Very often they should be sticking to technical
terms. How acidic is the wine, what is the tannin like, is it
fruit tannin or wood tannin, what is the grain of it? You
should be noticing whether the alcohol is hot, particularly at
the back of the mouth where alcohol strikes you. But I think
sometimes we want to convey more than just a description of
the basic elements. We want to, somehow, convey the
elegance, the finesse, the harmony, the qualities of overall
composition that transform this into a beautifully balanced
and pleasurable object. When we reach for those words some
bit of the job we’re doing is describing and some bit is
evaluating. We’re trying to describe not just what the
properties of the wine are, but also the quality the wine has,
as a way of recommending the qualities of the experience
you can have in tasting it. Critics, although they often
describe tastes as subjective, are in this business of recom-
mending wines to us and trying to tell us, ‘If you follow me
and follow what I’ve attended to, what I’ve seen, you too will
have a very hedonic experience, an incredibly intoxicating
pleasurable experience.’ Partly that’s recommendation, and
partly that’s hoping you’ll find what they find in the wine.

NW: Why should we believe wine experts at all? I know what I like to
drink, why should I need advice from an expert?

BS: Experts have tasted a larger range of wines than we
have. They can be our guides to what we might eventually
like. But to do that carefully is not to suppose that their taste
will replace yours. It’s important to find somebody whose
tastes coincide more nearly with yours. There will be
different populations of tasters, with different preferences,
different sensitivities, different attentions to certain flavours,
or qualities or compositions of wine. You have to search out
the critic who is closest to you, whose passions and reactions,
or pleasures, more nearly align with yours, and then you can
use them as a very good instrument to go and find the things
that might predict the pleasures you could have.

NW: Wine experts tell us that these amazing, complex, sophisticated
wines are the ones with the highest value, these are the things that we
ought to like. But what if we just like a cheaper taste?

BS: I think it was the British wine expert Hugh Johnson
who said that he had heard the statement: ‘I would always
prefer a lesser wine if it had more to say.’ We want wines that
have something to say, that have a personality. We can have
sensations that give us a lot of pleasure, and we can repeat the
dose, but eventually we get bored with them. Human beings
are such that if you keep giving them the same experience
their senses are dulled. They want variation, discrimination,
difference. That search for difference, and for rather more
complexity and variation, will lead them increasingly on to
attend more to what they’re drinking and to select better. And
the better you select and the more discrimination you exercise,
the more pleasure you get in that exercise of that discrimina-
tion. That might be what we mean by exercising taste.

NW: So the role of the expert in wine-tasting is, in part, educational.
The expert can open up new experiences for us and tell us that if we
approach a certain wine in a certain way, certain experiences are
possible. But that presupposes that we’re capable of experiencing the
same range of tastes as the expert. Surely some people are just better at
tasting than others?

BS: Some people might be better at tasting, though they’re
not so-called super-tasters. Super-tasters have an intense
sensitivity to some taste sensations and may find many wines
too acidic or bitter. But I think most of us have got the ability
to increase our range, and increase our discrimination, and
by doing so increase our pleasure. The more we attend, the
more we discriminate, the more we enjoy selecting and
noticing differences between wines, the more reward we get
from the experience.

NW: In some areas of life, over-reflection can actually diminish the
enjoyment of the activity. So pursuing happiness while thinking about
what the nature of happiness is, may actually impair our ability to
achieve happiness. Is it the same with drinking? If we start thinking too
much about the subtlety of the tastes, and how we’re going to describe
them, does that def lect away from the enjoyment of wine?

BS: It would be a danger if we became stamp-collectors and
we were simply looking to catalogue wines or classify them,
and perhaps even build up blind-tasting abilities to recognize
them out of any possible range of wines offered to us. What’s
important is that in tasting, talking about, and discriminat-
ing, we’re getting pleasure from wine. And these are
pleasures that we want to share—the sharing is probably
quite a fundamental part of our nature, and of our being
human and social animals. We don’t just want to be inter-
ested in what the properties of the wine are: it’s got to be the
experience of drinking the wine that really matters to us.

NW: There are some very cheap wines around. Some people are happy
drinking those. Wine experts tend not to be. Why is that?

BS: I think it’s to do with the complexity of experience you
can have. There are some very well-known wines at cheap
prices where you can get a simple, pleasurable drink. It might
be that you drink because of the pleasure of drinking with
other people and because of the intoxicating power of it, but
therefore it’s the effect of the wine you’re interested in, and
perhaps the occasion of sharing, rather than the way in which
the wine is creating that intoxicating pleasure. A good wine is
worthy of more of our effort, more of our time, more of our
attention, perhaps more of our money. If it’s interesting
enough to engage our attention it rewards us by what it can
show us, and by what we can learn from it. There are big
differences between a wine of £150, which none of us can
afford on a regular basis, if at all, and a wine of £2.99. The
former is very often more highly priced because it’s a hand-
made wine involving the skill, tradition and individual labour
of people on very exotic plots of land. They’re cultivating and
creating a beautifully-crafted object which will be unique in
history and will last for over twenty or thirty and in rare cases
100 years, and will have a lifetime and a personality and
development that outgrows the people who made it. And that
will never be the case with a £2.99 wine.

NW: Some people are quite happy to pay £40 or £50 to watch their
football team play on a Saturday—and quite right too, if the team’s good.
But they would baulk at paying more than £5 or £6 for a bottle of wine.
Perhaps wine appreciation is symptomatic of a certain social class.

BS: Anybody who really loves wine remembers their
epiphany. They remember the moment at which they tasted a
great wine, a wine of staggering power and beauty, where
they learnt for the first time that wine could do this, and they
understood that this wasn’t the simple drink they had
previously experienced. At that moment, they recognize
something about themselves and the wine: that a wine can
have power and profundity. But also they have the ability to
respond to it. What they want is more occasions like this—
and of course that’s what will lead them on to be collectors
seeking out such experiences. I see no reason why somebody
shouldn’t do that who had previously spent that £40 or £50
watching a football team, who comes to believe that over the
couple of hours spent with a friend discussing this wine they
were getting just as much, if not more, pleasure.

NW: I could develop a parallel interest in orange juice. Jaffa oranges
have been used for this orange juice, another variety for that one. There
are degrees of acidity and textures in different orange juices, and so on.
What’s special about wine that couldn’t be applied to orange juice or ice
cream or any range of things?

BS: When we open a bottle from the cellar that’s been there
from 1945, picked in the sunshine at the end of the war, we’re
tasting something that was made by men and women who
have long since ceased to live, but who have made this with
love and care and who expressed what nature had to offer at
that year and that time. They’ve handed something on to you
in which you taste not just the sensations you get, and not
just the qualities the wine has, but you’re tasting something
of history, you’re tasting something of their labour and their
work, of their traditions and their culture and their settling
of that land and soil to make wine for other people to enjoy,
to taste, and to learn about. And we can’t get that from
orange juice.
