ALEX NEILL ON
The Paradox of Tragedy

David Edmonds: George Bernard Shaw thought that comedy was
light drama in which everyone was married in the last act, while
tragedy was heavy drama in which everyone was killed. It’s been a
puzzle for philosophers for several thousand years that people like to
watch tragedies—which evoke feelings of sadness and suffering. The
same mystery attaches to horror movies—which aim to shock and
scare. Dr Alex Neill has the happiest of roles as the University of
Southampton’s foremost expert on tragedy.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we’re going to focus on today is the
paradox of tragedy. I wonder if you could begin by saying what this
paradox is.

Alex Neill: The paradox of tragedy is something that
philosophers have discussed for thousands of years. It
emerges, for example, from some of what Aristotle says in his
Poetics. Aristotle defines tragedy in terms of the affective, or
the emotional, response that it’s designed to generate, which
is, he says, the catharsis of pity and fear. ‘Catharsis’ is often
taken to mean something like a purging or a cleansing of
emotion. Whether or not that’s right—and there’s been a
great deal of scholarly debate about the matter—Aristotle
makes it clear that he thinks that catharsis, as the end or the
telos of tragedy, is something that’s meant to be pleasurable.
Indeed, he says that the job of the tragic poet is to aim at
producing in the audience a particular kind of pleasure, and
he describes that as the pleasure of pity and fear.

NW: Okay. But there doesn’t sound anything paradoxical about
producing pity or fear.

AN: No, there doesn’t sound anything paradoxical just
about producing pity and fear. The paradox arises when we
ask a bit more closely about the nature of pity and fear. That’s
something that Aristotle himself discusses at some length in
another work, a work called the Rhetoric. There he defines
both pity and fear as painful feelings: pity is a painful feeling
derived from the sight of somebody unfairly or unjustly
suffering; fear is a kind of pain at the thought of present or
possible danger or calamity to oneself or others. So, on the
one hand, in the Poetics we have Aristotle talking about the
pleasure of pity and fear; in the Rhetoric, however, he’s
defined both pity and fear as kinds of pain. So, the idea that
the tragic poet should aim at the pleasure of pity and fear
turns out to be the thought that the tragic poet should aim at
the pleasure of a kind of pain, and there you’ve got some-
thing that looks a bit more paradoxical.

NW: So the paradox lies in the fact that Aristotle is saying tragedy
causes us to feel a certain way. We watch a play, and we feel pleasure.
But at the same time, the kinds of emotions that he thinks are particu-
larly associated with tragedy, by their nature, cause us pain.

AN: That’s right. Now, you might wonder whether this is
really very paradoxical at all. You might believe that you can
in fact feel both pleasure and pain at the same time, and you
might think that in fact that’s characteristic of our experience
of all kinds of art. Where that’s most plausible, it’s going to
be plausible because the pleasure and the pain are directed in
different directions. So that at the same time that you’re
feeling horror, terror, shock, at the content of the story that
you’re reading or that’s being enacted in front of you on the
stage, you can be delighted by, impressed by, the artistry
with which it’s being represented. So as I watch Gloucester
having his eyes plucked out, in King Lear, that may be
revolting; indeed, depending on the nature of the produc-
tion, it may be physically nauseating. Yet in the moment that
I’m nauseated I can be struck, in a way that might naturally
be described as pleasurable, by the astonishing way in which
the actors up there are combining this magnificent poetic
language with something that is so traumatizing.

NW: I can see also another explanation: that you might be alternating
in your response to a play between pain and pleasure. So, in Macbeth,
you feel the pain as you hear Duncan being gruesomely murdered
offstage, and then immediately afterwards you get the pleasure from the
light-hearted porter scene, which is a humorous scene.

AN: I think that’s right, too. So we’ve got two stories now:
one is that we might feel pleasure and pain simultaneously,
but directed at different sorts of object. The other is that we
might feel pleasure and pain in sequence, but now directed at
the same kind of object—because in the example you’ve just
given it’s the content of the play that is the object of both the
pleasure and the pain.

NW: So, does that mean that there isn’t really a paradox of tragedy
because there’s a way of resolving it quite easily?

AN: No, I don’t think it does, unfortunately; things aren’t
that easy. Although both of the lines of thought that you and
I have been working out are plausible, they don’t get to the
heart of the problem. Aristotle didn’t just say, ‘We take
pleasure in tragedy’; what he said is that the tragic poet aims
to produce the pleasure of pity and fear. We’re not going to be
able to get Aristotle off the hook by appealing to different
objects which pity and fear on the one hand and pleasure on
the other might have, or by suggesting that we have these
different sorts of response, the pleasurable and the painful,
sequentially or at different times. Aristotle says it’s the
pleasure of the painful feelings, and that’s what’s difficult to
explain.

NW: So, do you have an explanation of how you can take pleasure in
pity or fear?

AN: I do have an explanation which I think helps us to
resolve the paradox, although it’s not an explanation of how
we can take pleasure in the experience of pity and fear.
I think the answer, to put it very briefly, is that our engage-
ment with tragedy, as a form of art, is not an engagement
that can plausibly be characterized primarily in terms of
pleasure. I have an explanation of why it is that people for
centuries have characterized it in these terms. I think it’s
because for centuries people have recognized that tragedy is
a form of art that matters, that’s especially important to us.
And it’s patently one that continues to appeal to us; people
stage tragedies and make films of tragedies—think of
modern movie versions of Macbeth, of Hamlet, and so on:
these things sell. Why is it that people value these works of
art? Well, for centuries people thought that you can only
explain value and motivation in terms of pleasure. That’s a
very old theory; you find it very clearly in Hobbes for
example, and in Hume, who says that ‘the chief spring and
actuating principle’ of the human mind is pleasure and pain.
The thought here is that we’re motivated to pursue things
which give us pleasure, and to avoid things which give us
pain. And if you think that our motivations and what we
value are going to be wrapped up together, as surely they
are, then it’s natural to think that what we value is going to
be that which gives us pleasure. Given that we patently do
value tragedy then, it must be that we take pleasure in
tragedy. How can this be? And so the paradox gets started.

NW: From what you’ve said, you are not completely happy with the
idea that the sole motivation for human action is the pursuit of pleasure.

AN: No, I’m not. I think that increasingly philosophers have
come to realize the limitations of the idea, although all too
often they haven’t carried the lesson over into the philosophy
of art. There are all sorts of examples which suggest that
we’re not only motivated to do things because we find them
pleasurable. We can be motivated to do things because we
think we ought to do them, because we think it’s good to do
them, and so on, without deriving any pleasure from that.
The obvious response is that you only do what you think is
your duty, for example, because doing your duty gives you
pleasure, but if you push this far enough back it becomes
very implausible. If I’ve got a terminal disease and my doctor
knows it, I want my doctor to tell me what she knows. And
here’s my motivation: I regard being in a state where I know
that I’ve got the disease as valuable to me. I think it would
just be completely desperate, philosophically, to say: ‘Well, if
that’s the case, it must somehow be that knowing that you’ve
got a terminal disease is pleasurable.’

NW: Are you suggesting then that a possible motivation for watching
a tragedy is not pleasure but the pursuit of truth, maybe truth about the
human condition or something like that?

AN: Yes, I am. I’m not sure that I want to put the motiva-
tion baldly in those terms, but I think the reason that we find
tragedy valuable as an art form—indeed, a reason why
tragedy has often been taken to be a peculiarly philosophical
form of art—is that we regard tragedy as a source of insight.
I don’t think we value King Lear primarily because it brings us
pleasure—although it may do so, not least because of its
artistry, its language and poetry. We value it primarily
because it directs, with great acuity, a particularly bright
searchlight on certain things: Shakespeare says, ‘as flies to
wanton boys are we to the gods; They kill us for their sport.’
You might think that the thought that ‘as flies to wanton
boys are we to the gods’ isn’t particularly original, but what
is original is the way in which Shakespeare in that play shows
us the implications of that thought. I think that’s why we
value Lear.

So I think the paradox of tragedy is to be dissolved in
effect by saying Aristotle was wrong. The tragic poet’s task is
not really to generate in the audience a peculiar species of
pleasure. What he should have said, and arguably what he
really means, is that a tragic poet aims at giving us a certain
kind of insight.

NW: Horror movies are superficially similar to tragedies in a sense
that they invite us to observe often quite gruesome murders or terrible
events, and we take some pleasure in them. Do you think the same
explanation could hold for those? After all, it’s not obvious what insight
we get from watching The Omen for instance as compared with
watching King Lear.

AN: Yes, I agree entirely. Horror movies look like a
problem for me because our experience of them is at least
superficially similar to our experience of tragedies. On the
one hand, it seems that we take pleasure in horror movies.
On the other, we might define horror—indeed, the
American philosopher Noël Carroll has defined it in just
this way—in terms of its capacity to produce a certain kind
of affect: nausea, disgust, fear, and so on. And these are not
pleasant emotions. So it looks as though you’ve got a paradox
of horror that exactly echoes the paradox of tragedy, and yet
my solution patently won’t work. It won’t work because, as
you’ve just said, very few horror movies—which is not to
say no horror movies, but very few horror movies—can
plausibly be thought of as a source of great insight or truth
or understanding or anything like that. And it’s patently
implausible to suggest that people don’t enjoy—perfectly
straightforwardly enjoy—horror movies.

NW: So, do you have an explanation of how there could be a difference
between these two cases?

AN: Yes, I do, and I think the difference lies in the kind of
affect that’s involved, in the kind of emotional response that
the two forms of art involve. Tragedy aims at the generation
of a kind of affect that is essentially or inherently disturbing
or distressing. I don’t know if I’d want to go along with
Aristotle in defining emotions like pity and fear as kinds of
pain, exactly, but there’s something to that thought. I don’t
think that the same is true of the kind of emotions that
horror movies and novels trade in. Those kinds of emotions
are much more like the kinds of emotion that you might
experience when you’re on a roller-coaster ride. They are
kinds of emotions that can indeed be part of a complex of
experience that is overwhelmingly negative, but they can
just as well be part of a complex of experience that is
overwhelmingly, or at least on balance, positive.

NW: So what you’re saying is that horror movies are different from
tragedies in that horror movies are more about generating particular
kinds of thrill. But couldn’t an alternative explanation be that both of
these genres are motivated by the dark side of humanity, the fact that
most of us, at some level, take a delight in seeing other people suffering?

AN: You might say that; indeed, people have said that about
both forms of art. To the extent that that kind of psychoana-
lytical explanation is plausible, it’s much more plausible when
it comes to explaining our experience of horror movies than
it is when it comes to explaining our experience of works of
tragic drama. Even if it’s true that we’re all at some deep level
sadists, capable of taking pleasure in observing the suffering
of others, it seems to me that that’s just not the best explana-
tion available to us of the kinds of ways in which we value
works of tragedy. It’s much more plausible to think that it’s a
decent explanation of the way in which we experience works
of horror. Even there, however, I don’t think it does the trick.
There’s a simpler explanation. I think it’s just that we are the
kind of creature who can take pleasure in experiencing
emotions of being thrilled, of being shocked, of being
alarmed, of being, in some loose sense of the word anyway,
terrified. I suggest that the appeal of roller-coaster rides at
fairgrounds is evidence of that.

NW: How can we tell who’s right about this issue?

AN: One way of telling is by thinking hard about our actual
experience of these different kinds of works, our experience
of King Lear or Antigone on the one hand, and our experience
of The Omen or The Exorcist (to take two very different sorts
of work) on the other hand. And we need to think hard
about the ways in which we do in fact value these works.
One way of doing that is by looking at what good critics, be
they literary critics or drama critics or movie critics, say
about them, at the ways in which they discuss these works
when they’re trying to explain what makes them valuable.
I suggest that if you look at a decent piece of critical writing
on a new production of Lear or of Antigone, you won’t
find many references to delight, to pleasure, to its being
enjoyable, and so on; at any rate, that’s unlikely to be the
overwhelming theme of the critic’s response. On the other
hand, if you read a good movie critic on a horror movie,
you’ll find that there are indeed references to being thrilled
or to being delighted as part of the discussion of how
horrifying or how scary it is. When good critics write about
horror films, the extent to which the films are pleasurable or
enjoyable is a major theme; when good critics write about
works of tragedy, the extent to which they’re pleasurable or
enjoyable is typically not a major theme. I take that to be
evidence that my explanation has got something going for it.
