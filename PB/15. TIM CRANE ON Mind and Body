METAPHYSICS AND MIND

TIM CRANE ON
Mind and Body

David Edmonds: The central issue in the Philosophy of Mind is how
the mind interacts with the body. ‘Dualists’ maintain that the mind and
the body are quite distinct. In the last century the Oxford philosopher
Gilbert Ryle ridiculed dualism by evoking an image of the mysterious
‘ghost in the machine’. How could this ghost move arms and legs? But
other philosophers, such as Thomas Nagel in an oft-quoted article,
‘What Is It Like To Be A Bat?’, have questioned whether the mind can be
reduced to the purely physical. The difficulty is accounting for subjective
experience. Could the solution to the mind–body problem lie with
scientists? After all, our understanding of the brain is expanding all
the time: could neurologists eventually discover how the mind influences
the body? Tim Crane, a leading authority on the Philosophy of Mind,
thinks not.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we want to focus on is mind and body,
the relationship between the two. We all know what the body is, but
could you say a little bit about what the mind is?

Tim Crane: The best way to think of this is not to think of
the mind as being a thing—some sort of entity that may or
may not be separate from the body—but rather to think of
human beings as having mental capacities. People have the
capacity to think, to act, to feel, and to have emotions and to
be conscious: all these mental capacities are the things that
I would classify together as the mind.

NW: You say ‘to act’—in the sense of doing things—but why is that
mental?

TC: It’s a good question. Why do we classify all the mental
things together as the mental at all? I think action is mental
because it’s intentional, in the sense that it’s directed on to
something other than itself. So when you act, when you go
to buy yourself a coffee, you’re aiming at something beyond
yourself, namely the result of getting a coffee.

NW: So it’s not just a physical movement?

TC: I suppose that’s the big question: how the mental
capacities that we have relate to the physical world—our
physical bodies and the rest of the physical world. This is one
half of what I think of as the mind–body problem. If our
bodies are things in the physical world then moving our
bodies changes things in the physical world; it changes the
position of physical particles and matter; and we do these
things because of what we want, and how we think the
world is, and because of our states of consciousness and our
emotions, and so on. That gives rise to the conclusion that
the mind has effects in the physical world—that mental states
and processes have real physical effects in the world. But how
can something have effects in the world if it’s not physical
itself? And that’s the part of the mind–body problem which
forces you towards what people call materialism or physi-
calism: the idea that everything is physical or material.

NW: So what’s the other half?

TC: Well, the other half is when you start thinking of what
it would be for the mind to be physical. Obviously you look at
the brain: the brain is just a few pounds of this watery grey
stuff, this rather repulsive fatty substance, and that stuff
somehow gives rise to thought, to consciousness, to experi-
ence, to emotion, and all the mystery of our inner life. And
that’s extremely puzzling. So, on the one hand, when we
think of how the mind interacts with the physical world, we
think it must be something physical. But when we think
about consciousness, and in particular the problem of
consciousness—how something physical could be con-
scious—it is completely baffling.

NW: For the physicalist it’s not a problem, is it, because that gooey
stuff has all kinds of very complicated chemical electrical relationships
going on within it, which actually produce amazingly sophisticated
effects? Thinking is current moving in the brain.

TC: I think that’s right, in the sense that that’s what a
physicalist or materialist should say. But it’s one thing to say
it, it’s another thing to understand it. The American philoso-
pher Thomas Nagel has a brilliant analogy here; somebody
who says ‘the mind is the brain’ now, is in the position of an
ancient Greek who said that matter is energy. It’s true that
matter is energy, but the ancient Greeks who said that
wouldn’t understand how it could be true; they wouldn’t
understand what it meant to say that matter was energy.
They could assert that it was true, perhaps; but they wouldn’t
understand it. Nagel says this is the position we’re in with
respect to mind and brain. Of course we can say our mental
capacities are the product of the brain, but we have no idea
how this even could happen—it’s baffling.

NW: I don’t understand how a television works. I know it’s got all
kinds of complex components in there, and I know it’s physical. But I
don’t bring in the idea that there must be something mysteriously
working inside the television that’s not physical.

TC: I think there’s a difference between the two cases,
because although you don’t know how the TV works, the
scientists who make the TVs know how they work. It’s true
that scientists know a lot about how the brain works—
actually the brain is very well understood at the level of its
smallest parts. But what they don’t know is what it is about
the brain that gives rise to conscious experience. There are
different ways of thinking about this. You could think we’re
just missing that magical part, the Factor 57 or the magic
number that we’re going to find in the brain. When you
press that bit, consciousness lights up. It could be that our
position in relation to the brain is one of ignorance. I myself
don’t believe that. I think that the position that we’re in is
one of confusion. I think it’s a philosophical problem, a
philosophical conundrum in which we’re confused about
what it is that we’re trying to understand, rather than simply
a question of our ignorance.

NW: So even if the scientists had a complete map of the brain and
understood the way the different parts worked together, you’re saying it’s
unlikely, or just impossible, that we would have an understanding of
consciousness?

TC: I don’t want to say that, because I think we don’t know
what understanding of consciousness is. I think that’s why
we’re confused: because we don’t know what it is we’re
trying to explain.

NW: Are we just trying to clarify the meaning of the word ‘conscious-
ness’ or is there something more that philosophers can do here?

TC: I don’t think we’re just trying to clarify the meaning of
the word. We’re trying to understand the phenomenon of
consciousness. And we use whatever resources we can to
understand that phenomenon: resources of introspection, of
our knowledge of our own concepts, and scientific knowl-
edge where it’s relevant. Again, I want to stress the distinc-
tion between ignorance and confusion. In his discussion of
this, Thomas Nagel says that what we need to solve the
mind–body problem, the problem of consciousness, is new
concepts. Our concepts aren’t good enough. I’m very
sceptical about this: that we could solve this problem by
introducing some new concepts. And to this extent I agree
with the thrust of your question—that what we have to do is
get a clear view of the concepts that we already have. This is
where we’re confused.

NW: I’m going to press you on the scientific point. If we were looking
at the effects of a psychotropic medicine, we could look at scans, we
could look at people’s behaviour when they take the medicine, we could
hypothesize about how it acts on particular receptors in the brain and
causes certain sorts of changes in behaviour. Why couldn’t there be an
analogous investigation that investigates the nature of consciousness?

TC: I want to say two things about that. First, there is all
this evidence from brain scans, and you see pictures in the
newspapers: here’s the bit of the brain that’s responsible
for lust and here’s the bit of the brain responsible for mathe-
matics. Now for anyone who knows anything about the
brain and psychology at all, it’s not surprising that there’s a
bit of your brain that lights up when you talk, and a bit of the
brain that lights up when you walk. So this is not a discovery
that we should be surprised at. The fundamental puzzle is
how it is that anything like this brain can give rise to
anything like conscious experience at all.

The second thing I want to say is about consciousness
itself. Some neuroscientists have said that we can identify the
correlate of conscious experience with some particular kind
of brain activity. Now, that presupposes, it seems to me, that
there is some one thing which is being correlated with this
neural thing. There is something going on in your brain
which is correlated with the phenomenon of consciousness.
And that presupposes that consciousness is one phenomenon.
And I’m not sure that we know that consciousness is one
phenomenon. For example, when you’re dreaming there’s a
kind of conscious experience going on there that’s different
from the kind of consciousness that goes on when you’re
daydreaming. Why should we think that there’s one simple
quality that associates with all these things that we call
conscious experiences? These are the questions that philoso-
phers need to address—questions about the phenomenologi-
cal structure of consciousness itself. By ‘phenomenological’
I mean the structure as it seems to us—phenomenology is
the study of appearances. So we ought to study appearances
and understand what sort of structure consciousness has
from our point of view.

NW: So in this area of consciousness what’s the role of the neuro-
scientist?

TC: To understand how the brain works, and more
specifically how psychological capacities are realized in the
brain, is an enterprise which is deeply involved in philosophy
itself. Psychology is very philosophically committed. As soon
as psychologists set up a project to understand something
like memory, or attention, or perception, they are presuppos-
ing certain things about the nature of these phenomena: they
are taking a stand on certain philosophical issues. So
psychology and philosophy are very closely intertwined.
Neuroscientists are further away from philosophy, and for
that reason it’s harder for the neuroscientist to make a
contribution to this problem of consciousness.

NW: Would it be fair to say that, in your view, a philosopher in an
armchair somewhere, thinking, reading, corresponding with people,
could actually solve or possibly dissolve the major problem of conscious-
ness; and yet scientists with neurological probes, or with scalpels and
their hands bloodied, won’t solve it?

TC: That is my view, at least in the following sense: you
don’t solve the problem of consciousness by looking into
the brain. If I’m right that the questions we’re asking about
consciousness are the result of confusion rather than
ignorance, then the philosopher has to unpick those
confusions or unravel them. If we don’t believe in a Cartesian
soul, or we don’t believe there is something apart from the
material world, that if we took away the material world there
would be nothing left, then what should we think? I don’t
believe there is a Cartesian soul, so I think that in some way
or another we have to find a way of integrating all our
knowledge of the material world that removes the mystery
that we’ve been talking about. That’s the essence of the
problem of consciousness.
