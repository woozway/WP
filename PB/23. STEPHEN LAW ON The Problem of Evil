THE MEANING OF LIFE

STEPHEN LAW ON
The Problem of Evil

David Edmonds: There is a powerful objection to those, like
Christians, Jews, and Muslims, who believe in an all-powerful, all-good
God. Stephen Law is here to discuss it. He teaches at the University of
London and is the editor of the journal Think.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we want to talk about is the Problem of
Evil. Can you outline what that is?

Stephen Law: Well, there are really two problems not one.
If we begin with the thought that God is all-powerful,
all-good, and indeed all-knowing, the question, then, is why
does evil exist? or why does evil exist in quite the quantities that it
does? There are two different problems here. The first is
called the logical problem of evil. Some people argue that the
existence of God is logically incompatible with the existence
of any suffering or evil whatsoever. The other problem of
evil is this. If you believe in an all-powerful, all-good God,
why is there quite so much suffering and evil in the world?
Surely an all-powerful, all-good God would have the ability
to produce a world with far less suffering, and, if He’s
all-good, then He would surely want the world to contain far
less suffering. Why, then, is there quite so much suffering?
So, on the evidential problem of evil, it’s the quantity of evil
that’s really the issue, whereas on the logical problem it’s the
existence of any evil or any suffering at all that’s deemed the
problem. The quantity of suffering is evidence that there is
no God.

NW: So you’re treating suffering as evil.

SL: Well, it’s clearly an evil, and it tends to be the evil that
gets focused on when people discuss the problem of evil. It
might perhaps be better to call the problem of evil the
problem of suffering. The word ‘evil’ comes with a lot of
metaphysical baggage. We can drop all of the metaphysical
baggage and just talk about suffering. The existence of
enormous quantities of suffering clearly is a bit of a problem
for anybody who believes in an all-powerful, all-good God.

NW: Returning to the distinction between a logical problem of evil
and an evidential one, do you think they’re both equally important to
discuss?

SL: Well, they’re both very interesting problems. I think the
really serious problem for theists is the evidential problem.
Perhaps the logical problem can be dealt with fairly easily. It
would do to show that an all-powerful, all-good God would
create some suffering, if that suffering is the price that has to
be paid for some greater good that outweighs it. It would be
a better world with the suffering in it. That sounds paradoxi-
cal, but it’s not. For instance, you might say that compassion
and sympathy are great virtues and it’s important that people
have the opportunity to exhibit these virtues, but they’re not
going to be able to exhibit these virtues unless there are
some people who are suffering and for whom we can feel
sympathy.

NW: So that’s the logical problem. But the evidential problem is: why
is there so much suffering?

SL: That’s right. The issue now is not that suffering is
logically incompatible with the existence of an all-powerful,
all-good God, but that an all-powerful, all-good God surely
would not produce a world with quite so much suffering in
it. For me, that argument more or less settles the question of
whether or not God exists. It does seem to me that there is
overwhelming empirical evidence against the existence of an
all-powerful, all-good God.

But before we talk about that, it would be helpful if we
thought about what makes a belief reasonable, generally.
People often get confused about reasonableness and about
truth. What I want to stress about reasonableness is that it is
a matter of degree. Beliefs can be more or less reasonable.
Some beliefs are very reasonable indeed, some a little less
reasonable, some not terribly reasonable but not unreason-
able, and then some beliefs are highly unreasonable. There is
a scale of reasonableness on which you can locate beliefs. Take
the belief that Japan exists. I’ve never been there, I’ve never
seen Japan with my own eyes, but it seems to be a very
reasonable thing to believe because I’ve got overwhelming
evidence that Japan exists. I’ve eaten in sushi restaurants;
I’ve met people who claim to have come from Japan; and I’ve
got no reason to think there is some vast international
conspiracy to fool westerners into thinking Japan is there
when it is not. Having said that, I can’t conclusively prove
beyond all doubt that Japan exists. Maybe those people who
claim to come from Japan spend hours in make-up before I
meet them. But still, that Japan exists is a very reasonable
thing for me to believe. Other beliefs are a bit less reasonable
but still quite reasonable. Is there intelligence on other
planets somewhere else in the universe? That’s not an
unreasonable thing to believe. We know that intelligent life
has evolved here. We know there are countless millions of
planets like this one; on the other hand, we don’t have any
great evidence of any such life. Moving down the scale of
reasonableness we reach the beliefs that fairies exist, goblins
exist, and Elvis Presley is alive and well and living in
Swindon. These are beliefs for which there is very little
evidence and indeed a great deal of evidence against them,
despite what you might read on some Internet sites.

NW: So we’ve got this scale of beliefs from the highly plausible to the
highly implausible. How does that help us with the problem of whether
God exists or not?

SL: Well, the important issue is not whether or not there is
conclusive proof—proof beyond all doubt. It may be that we can’t
conclusively prove beyond all doubt that God exists, and it
also may be that we cannot conclusively prove that there is
no God. But, even if we can’t prove it either way, it might still
be possible to establish that belief in God is either very
reasonable indeed, despite not being proved, or—and this
would be my view—very unreasonable, despite not being
disproved. Whether or not we have ‘proof’ is really not the
issue: it’s a matter of reasonableness. It certainly won’t do for
religious people to say: ‘Well you can’t prove it either way, so
it’s a faith issue, and atheism is just as much a faith position as
theism.’ That’s simply not true. Even if we can’t ‘prove’ it
either way, it may well be that the atheist can come up with
fantastically good grounds for thinking that there is no God,
perhaps as good grounds as for thinking that there are no
fairies. After all, I can’t conclusively prove that there are no
fairies at the bottom of my garden.

NW: Now, you’ve said that belief in God is not a reasonable position.
Why do you believe that?

SL: The two things that I would point to are these. First of
all, look at many of those popular arguments for the exist-
ence of God which non-philosophers consider pretty
persuasive—such as arguments about design. Many people
say: ‘What are the chances of the universe being set up just
so, so that there are stable planets and life can evolve? It’s
astronomically unlikely that that situation should exist by
chance. Therefore it is reasonable to believe that there is
some sort of intelligence behind the universe.’ Perhaps. But
one problem with this argument is that it’s just an argument
for there being some sort of greater intelligence. Maybe it’s a
good argument. I don’t think it is, but let me concede for the
sake of argument that it is. What conclusions can we then
draw about the personality or the moral character of that
intelligence? And the answer is—really none at all. Why
conclude that the creator is the Judaeo-Christian God—who
is all-powerful and all-good, and supremely benevolent? Why
draw that conclusion? We haven’t yet been given any reason
at all to draw that conclusion. All we have been told, so far, is
that there is some sort of intelligence behind things. So that
popular argument fails.

So do others, such as crude first-cause cosmological
arguments. ‘Why is there anything at all? There must be a
creator who brought everything into existence!’ Alright,
there’s a creator, but why do you think he’s the Judaeo-
Christian God? So these arguments are not good arguments
for the existence of an all-powerful, all-good God. Worse
still, there’s fantastically good evidence against the
existence of there being any such creator. That evidence is
the problem of evil.

NW: But theists usually have responses to the problem of evil. They’ve
got theories, known as theodicies, which explain how there could be evil
in the world.

SL: Yes. One of the most popular is the free-will explana-
tion of suffering. There are various versions of this. The
simplest version says: ‘God gave us free will. He didn’t
make us automata that just do whatever God commands us
to do or makes us do, as if we were his puppets dancing on
his strings. He cut the strings, set us free, so that we can
make our own choices, our own decisions, and act upon
them. And unfortunately we sometimes choose to do the
wrong thing, and we start wars and steal and so on.
Suffering results. But that suffering is outweighed by the
good of free will.’

NW: That argument sounds pretty convincing to me; what’s wrong
with it?

SL: Well, one problem is that it fails to explain a very great
deal of suffering, such as the suffering produced by, for
example, natural disasters. Not very long ago there was an
earthquake in Pakistan in which tens of thousands of
children were crushed under buildings. They’d just arrived
at school, they were trapped underground, dying days or
even weeks later in some cases. How do we explain that in a
manner consistent with the existence of an all-powerful,
all-good God? It won’t do to say, ‘Well, it had something to
do with human free will’, because we don’t produce earth-
quakes, not even accidentally. To add to that, let’s not forget
that it’s not just human beings that are caused to suffer in
this way. Anyone who’s seen the BBC programme Planet
Earth will know that we share the world with many sentient
beings the lives of which are absolutely horrific. Not just
now, but it’s been that way for hundreds of millions of years.
About 250 million years ago there was a mass extinction
event—possibly a comet, we don’t know exactly—but we
know that it wiped 95 per cent of the species from the face of
the earth. That would have produced unimaginable suffer-
ing. Sharpening up the evidential problem of evil, we can put
it like this: an all-powerful, all-good God might put some
suffering in the world, but he wouldn’t put even an ounce of
gratuitous, unnecessary suffering into the world, not even an
ounce. Now, when I look at those hundreds of millions of
years of unimaginable horror, it seems to me that you can’t
sensibly maintain that there is any such being.

NW: What you’ve just said there about hundreds of millions of years
of suffering points perhaps not to a good God but to a not very nice God.

SL: We could consider that as a hypothesis. There is an
all-powerful, all-evil God. The first thing you’ll notice is that
that hypothesis is just as well supported by most of the
standard arguments for the existence of God as the good-
God hypothesis. If there’s a designer, why not an evil
designer rather than a good designer? If there’s a first cause,
why not an evil first cause rather than a good first cause? If
I believe in an evil God, I can help myself to those arguments
just as effectively as if I believed in a Christian God.

But of course, nobody’s going to believe in an evil God.
Why not? Well, look out of the window. Right now I can see
happy laughing children frolicking around in the sunshine.
Why would an evil God allow that kind of thing? Surely a
supremely malignant being would be interested in torturing
us for all eternity with a red-hot poker, not producing
rainbows and laughter and sunshine and ice cream. There’s
just too much good stuff in the world for this to be plausibly
the creation of a supremely powerful, supremely evil being.
You can see that this problem—we might call it the problem
of good—is just the reverse of the problem of evil. If you
believe in an all-powerful, all-good God you have to
explain why there’s so much bad stuff. If you believe in an
all-powerful, all-bad God you have to explain why there’s so
much good stuff. Actually, it seems to me that you can
probably also develop some ingenious arguments to deal
with the problem, why does an evil God give us a lovely
sunset to enjoy? To make our appreciation of the ghastly
dreariness and ugliness of day-to-day life so much more
acute. Why does he give us fit and healthy young bodies?
Well, he only does so for about ten or fifteen years. Then,
slowly and inevitably, people slide into decay and decrepitude
until they end up dying, hopelessly ugly, incontinent and
smelling of wee, having lived out a short and ultimately
meaningless existence. I mean, what better way could there
be of maximizing suffering than giving you something good
for a short period of time and then slowly and inexorably
taking it away? Most of the standard theodicies can be flipped
round. And when you flip them round in this way, they’re a
joke. So, the question is: why do we take the standard
theodicies so seriously? On the scale of reasonableness, I
place an evil God very low down. But that’s exactly the
reason why I place the good God very low down on the scale
of reasonableness.

NW: So what is a reasonable thing to believe?

SL: To get back to the scale of reasonableness, it seems to
me that the evil-God and the good-God hypotheses are both
very low down on the scale. A slightly less unreasonable
unbelief would be that there is some sort of intelligence, only
it is neither all-good nor all-evil. Maybe there is a God and he
has good days and bad days. If you look at the God of the Old
Testament, then pretty obviously that being is not supremely
benevolent. He’s a rather irascible old sod much of the time,
but he has his good days. If you look at the world, it does
seem to fit that hypothesis better than either the evil-God
hypothesis or the good-God hypothesis. But frankly, we can
probably, and should probably, do without any gods at all.
