GOD, ATHEISM, AND
THE MEANING OF LIFE

A. C. GRAYLING 
ON Atheism

David Edmonds: Professor A. C. Grayling is an author so prolific that
the suspicion in the philosophy world is that he runs a secret team of
underlings, churning out essays, reviews, and books on his behalf. Never
one to duck controversy, he’s a prominent public intellectual, comment-
ing as a philosopher on an extensive range of issues. A recent book is
entitled Against All Gods. That gives a subtle clue to his uncompromis-
ing stance on religion.

Nigel Warburton: We’re focusing on ‘atheism’ for this discussion:
what do you understand by that term?

A. C. Grayling: Atheism is a rejection of the idea that there
are gods or supernatural agencies of any kind in the world. It
is even a rejection of the idea that there might have been
supernatural agencies at some earlier point in the universe’s
history, which is the deist position. I am an atheist, but I don’t
like the term very much. I don’t like it for this reason: it
makes matters look as though there is something worth
denying the existence of. I much prefer the term naturalist, to
mean somebody who thinks that the universe is a realm of
natural law: one where the concepts of physics and chemistry
describe what there fundamentally is in this universe of ours,
without need or indeed room for a supernaturalistic or
magical supplement. It does not say that all phenomena—
such as the human need for poetry and beauty—are reduc-
tively explicable by, say, the chemistry of the nervous system.
There are naturally emergent properties of complex systems
which enter into an account of the intentional and social
aspects of reality as it most interests creatures like us. But it
does say that, ultimately, whatever there is, is part of nature
and arises from it.

NW: Is that consistent with agnosticism?

ACG: Agnosticism is the view that you don’t know whether
or not there are supernatural agencies, and it seems to me a
wishy-washy, fence-sitting kind of view. The question at
stake here is about rationality. The intellectual respectability
of the claim that there are gods, say the gods of Olympus or
the gods of Hinduism, or one god, say the God of Judaism,
seems to me exactly on a par with the intellectual respect-
ability of thinking there are fairies at the bottom of your
garden. Belief in fairies was very widespread until the late
nineteenth century: indeed, people believed that fairies were
far more present in their lives than God was. Things that
went missing, for example, such as shoelaces or teaspoons,
had been stolen by fairies, they thought. So the comparison
here is not a joke one. And if you think that the reasons you
have for believing there are fairies are poor reasons, and that
it’s irrational to think that there are such beings, then belief
in supernatural agencies in general is irrational in the same
way. So for me it’s a question of the rationality of belief.
Agnostics, who think there is as much chance that there
might be such entities as that there might not be such
entities, fall foul of these strictures. There is no fifty–fifty
likelihood about the existence of fairies—or other putative
supernatural entities.

NW: One argument that religious believers quite often use is that the
world has been so perfectly designed that there must have been a God to
do it. This approach has had a new lease of life with so-called Intelligent
Design. Do you have a view on that?

ACG: Yes I do. The Intelligent Design movement is a fig-leaf,
a big one, for creationism. What its proponents wish to do is to
promote the intelligibility and also the rationality of the idea
that there might be a conscious purpose behind the way things
are in the universe. Yet we have an extremely powerful and
very deep theory about how appearance of design and organi-
zation in the universe emerges, not least in the biological
realm, in the form of Darwinian theory. If you took seriously
the thought that there is or was a designer, that designer would
have to be a particularly incompetent one, because there are so
many ways in which the universe could be very much better
organized than it is: the human body, for example, has a few
bad design features of an almost actionable kind—one would
have a case in law against the designer, if there were one!

NW: But there’s a response that believers give there, which is that God
moves in mysterious ways.

ACG: It’s such an easy one, that one; it gets you out of all
sorts of holes. In fact that leads on to this rather interesting
thought. If you invoke the notion of an omniscient, omnipo-
tent, eternal being, the standard idea of God, absolutely
anything follows, and correlatively nothing counts as
counter-evidence against the existence of a God. We’re all
familiar with Karl Popper’s dictum that if a theory or claim
purports to explain everything, and nothing counts as
inconsistent with the claim, then it’s empty: it explains
nothing and does no work.

NW: Opponents of that kind of view will say: ‘That’s not that
dissimilar to science. Science actually purports to explain everything
and everything which it hasn’t yet explained will at some future date be
explicable by that method.’

ACG: I don’t think science claims that at all. Science at its
best is a public, testable, challengeable project, always having
to maintain its own respectability by saying what would serve
as counter-evidence against its hypotheses and concepts.
When people put forward views in science they publish them
so that other people can test them, review them, try to
replicate results, and I think that is absolutely the model of
how epistemology should proceed: out there in the open, and
inviting the very toughest kind of response from other people.
Now of course what science premises, extra-theoretically, is
the idea that the universe is a place that can be understood:
that it’s a fundamentally intelligible realm, that if we have got
the right concepts, the right procedures, and the right
instruments, we will be able to increase our understanding of
it and maybe, in the ideal, come to a full understanding of it.
But that is a kind of methodological ideal: there’s going to be
plenty of work for scientists in their pursuit of achieving that.

NW: I find myself in the slightly strange position here of playing God’s
advocate. Carrying on in that vein, couldn’t you say that there would be
no morality without God?

ACG: That is an old canard. It entirely ignores the fact that
in the classical tradition of antiquity there are deep, rich,
powerful thoughts about the foundations of ethics and the
nature of the good life which make no appeal whatever to
any divine command or any government by a spirit-monarch
in the sky who will reward you if you do what he or she
requires and punish you if you don’t. All the very best and
deepest thinking about ethics has come from non-religious
traditions. To suggest that it’s not possible to have an ethics
unless you think there is a rewarder and punisher up there in
the sky, that you need an enforcer for morality, is a calumny
on all those whose reasons for behaving as they do towards
others—their desire to respect others, to try to be collegial,
to foster the project of cooperation in society—is premised
solely on their liking for and sympathies for their fellow
human beings, grounded on their reflection on human
nature and the human condition, and the question of what is
good. And by the way, there’s a logical fallacy involved in the
idea that morality needs an enforcer, that you do something
because somebody will beat you up if you don’t: the fallacy of
argumentum ad baculum (also known as the ‘appeal to force’,
the argument where force or the threat of force is given as a
justification for a conclusion). Indeed, people whose morality
comes in a box that they’ve taken off a shelf in the supermar-
ket of ideas—marked ‘Catholicism’ or ‘Islam’ or such—are
much less honourable and admirable than those who’ve
thought for themselves about these things.

NW: As an atheist, you’re not obliged to believe that death is final, but
actually most atheists do believe that. Where do you stand on that issue?

ACG: I think death is, gratefully, final. It’s no different
from the state that we were in before we were conceived.
Even though life is very short—I’m fond of pointing out to
people that the average human life is less than 1,000 months
long, which is a good reason for not wasting time if one can
help it—that fact provides a definite and useful terminus ad
quem. It means that the things that you want to achieve
must be achieved here. You must work: ‘work while you
have light’, as the nineteenth-century Swiss philosopher
Henri-Frédéric Amiel said. But it also means that in the end
there will be a wonderful rest from it all. You will survive in
the way science tells us, which is that our constituents
return to the elements, and become part of nature, and
remain permanently part of nature, because that, after all, is
what the conservation-of-energy law tells us. We’re not
going to disappear entirely—in the form of the bits that
we’re made of.

NW: The reasons that you gave would make death being final a good
thing. But they’re not reasons for believing that death is final.

ACG: There’s no evidence of any convincing kind, apart
from anecdotal tales about ghosts, which suggests that there
is any form of continued existence following death. I’d be
interested to hear what would count as such evidence. I’ve
had the experience of meeting people who are terrified by the
thought that there is an alternative dispensation, or that they
might remain conscious in some way after death, locked in a
coffin or sliding into the furnace or meeting beings on the
other side of the Styx, being a new boy all over again in a new
world: in prospect it seems rather exhausting, as well as silly.

NW: Many millions of people around the world do believe in God or
gods. They seem to get quite a lot out of it. Do you begrudge them that?

ACG: Yes and no—which is a good philosophical answer! I
understand why it is that people might find comfort or solace
in having something to hang on to in times of distress. It
would be cruel on an occasion when somebody has that deep
need to say: ‘What you believe is a load of rubbish.’ I also
recognize that the church in its heyday, when it was wealthy
and could commission lots of works of art and oratorios, gave
plenty of work to artists, some of whom were sincere in their
work and some of whom doubtless laughed all the way to the
bank. So in different ways, both on the personal front and
the public front, the phenomenon of belief was not always or
wholly bad. But, on the other hand, the record of organized
religion in human history has been a dismal one, and on
balance far more negative than positive. It’s been the source
of tremendous conflict and tremendous oppression. It has
been so both internally, from the point of view of individuals
agonizing over such matters as sexuality and sin, and
externally in dividing people from one another and provid-
ing reasons for them to murder one another. It has been an
oppressive burden in human history, even though it paid for
the Sistine Chapel and helped people on their own, fright-
ened at night, to feel a little safer.

NW: I’ve been struck by how, recently, there’s been a glut of books about
atheism by, amongst others, Daniel Dennett, Richard Dawkins, and
Julian Baggini. Do you think we’re in a golden age of atheism right now?

ACG: I don’t know about that. I think those books are a
reaction to what looks like a resurgence of religion in our
contemporary world. I don’t myself think that we’re seeing a
resurgence of religion; I think we’re seeing a mighty
turning-up of the volume by the religious, which is a
different thing. That might well be a symptom of the fact
that religion feels so under pressure that it’s doing what it did
in the sixteenth century, at the time of the Reformation,
when Catholicism, which had been the single dominant
outlook in western Christendom, became vigorous in trying,
unsuccessfully, to recover its lost hegemony over the mind of
Europe. These were death-throes that caused the awful wars
of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, wars caused by
the church’s loss of power and the futile but murderous
struggle to regain it. It might well be that—with globaliza-
tion and the fact that Islamic culture, in particular, feels
greatly under pressure and threatened by the rapid spread
of what must seem unacceptable aspects of western
morality—it is a case of irritation, anxiety, and frustration
being ratcheted up.

So in response to the religious amplifiers being turned up,
of course people have been arguing against the religious
noise. And on the following two grounds: first, the irration-
ality of religious belief itself; and secondly, the crucial
question of the place of religion in public debate—that is, in
the public domain and in politics. What one doesn’t want to
see is a relatively small group of people imposing traditional-
ist and often reactionary views on everyone else. Remember
that in the UK the people who go every week to mosque,
temple, synagogue, or church constitute about 8 per cent of
the population. And yet they’re given a huge amount of
air-time on the BBC, they get public tax money for their
faith-based schools, they’ve been arguing for exemption from
various anti-discrimination laws. These things are unaccept-
able. So there’s a very serious debate to be had here about the
place of religion in the public domain, given that our culture
is a functionally secular one. Secularism is something that
religions themselves should be embracing for their own
survival. Because if any one religion were to become
dominant in the public sphere, the inevitable result is that the
other ones will be marginalized or even eventually silenced.
So it would do all of us good if a secular dispensation were to
persist, having been won with such difficulty in the last few
centuries.
