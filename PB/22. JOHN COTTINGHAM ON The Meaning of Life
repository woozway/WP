GOD, ATHEISM, AND
THE MEANING OF LIFE

JOHN COTTINGHAM ON
The Meaning of Life

David Edmonds: Today we’re discussing a minor, trivial, incon-
sequential, topic—the Meaning of Life. It’s a subject that threatens
to descend into philosophical caricature—the sort that might have been
satirized in Monty Python or Douglas Adams. But Professor John
Cottingham, of Reading University, thinks that the Meaning of Life is
worthy of serious philosophical consideration.

Nigel Warburton: I’d like to ask you about a topic that is quite
serious for most of us, the meaning of life. What do you think the
meaning of life is?

John Cottingham: Well, I can’t give you a quick one-
sentence answer on that, but the topic’s been very exciting
to me, partly because, when I was an undergraduate, we
were told philosophy doesn’t deal with such questions. One
of the exciting things about philosophy today is that it has
become a much broader and richer subject than it was when
I was a student, and the traditional grand questions are now
back on the agenda. There’s been a great deal of material
published recently on the question of the meaning of life.
The answer to the question is a complicated one. The main
problem about human existence is its fragility. The projects
that we embark on are constantly in danger of foundering
because of the ordinary contingencies of life.

NW: Do you mean because of death? That’s the obvious fragility
underlying everything—that we’re going to die at some point.

JC: Exactly, that’s the most striking one. But also illness, old
age, infirmity. Philosophers have often written as if human
beings are grand, autonomous, self-sufficient agents who are
somehow in charge of their lives, and then philosophy’s job is
supposed to be to map out the conditions for the good life.
Well, there’s nothing wrong with trying to map out the
conditions for the good life, but we can never be in complete
control of things, because our lives are subject to the kinds of
contingencies just mentioned. So a meaningful life has to be
one which is not just rich in various ways—a life that
includes enriching and valuable activities—but one that
somehow comes to terms with this fragility and this
contingency.

NW: So you’re saying that as human beings we encounter things,
obstacles to our projects. I might want to be an athlete and I break my leg
when I’m 21 and it’s just not possible. In other words, the contingency
that pervades our existence is always liable to upset any mapped-out
plan for human life?

JC: That’s exactly right, yes. The other feature of a mean-
ingful life is hard to specify but has to do with the moral
dimension. I don’t think we can count a life as meaningful
if it’s entirely occupied with selfish or vicious activities.
We require our lives to have a certain moral resonance in
order for them to count as genuinely meaningful. So both
these things I’ve mentioned, the contingency bit and the
moral resonance bit, point us away from simplistic
answers—for example, utilitarian answers which claim
everything boils down to pleasure and satisfaction, or to
getting whatever we happen to want—and point us instead
towards, to put it loosely, something more spiritual. So
questions about the meaning of life are connected with some
of the great traditional questions about the place of spiritu-
ality in human existence.

NW: Could you give me an example of a way in which contingencies
affect our projects?

JC: I will, and of ways in which they affect even our moral
projects. Consider the case of a dedicated moralist who
spends all his life helping others. He decides to build a
hospital for lepers, he devotes vast amounts of time and
massive resources towards raising money for this project, he
works at it, he recruits people to help, but on the day the
hospital is due to open it’s struck by a meteorite, so his
project is in ashes, and he dies full of disappointment and
despair. Can we say that he has had a meaningful life? Well,
if we define meaningfulness just in terms of engaging with
worthwhile moral goals, then perhaps we can. But most
people, I suspect, would say that because of the disastrous
way this person’s plans turned out, they ended in a certain
sort of futility. Now you could say with Albert Camus, in his
famous The Myth of Sisyphus, one of the great icons of
twentieth-century existentialist philosophy, that this is
just the way things are. We roll the rock up the hill, like
Sisyphus. In Greek mythology, he was sentenced to the
endless task of pushing a massive boulder uphill, only to see
it roll down again each time he gets to the top. He turns
around, walks back down the hill, and starts again. Camus
says in the last sentence of his essay that we must imagine
Sisyphus as being happy. Well perhaps there’s irony
there—or perhaps there isn’t. But it’s certainly an absurdist
vision. He’s saying human life never really succeeds. The
rock is always going to roll down the hill. For Camus, we’ve
somehow got to be defiant in the face of that absurdity.

I suppose you could conceivably live that way. You could
just say: ‘Well, let’s just try and live as morally as possible,
and when we fail, when contingencies strike, we just walk
down the hill and start again.’ But that would presuppose a
very heroic temperament. I don’t believe that you and I could
live this way; or perhaps you could, but I certainly couldn’t
and nor, I suspect, could the vast majority of human beings.
We could not live in that utterly heroic way in the face of
radical contingency and absurdity. And it’s this, the need for
some hope that, despite all our weakness, and despite all the
contingencies of life and the fragilities of our nature, the
good is somehow still worth pursuing and the good cannot
finally be defeated—it’s this that leads us towards the idea of
spirituality.

NW: So are you saying that, in the absence of hope that humanity will
save itself, we have to look outward to God or some other life after death?

JC: Well perhaps I’m saying that. But I think we should
beware of simplistic interpretations of religion which just say:
‘Oh well, we can’t do it ourselves so it’s all going to be fine in
the next world.’ I’m certainly not advocating that kind of
pie-in-the-sky approach. Rather it’s this. Simple optimism, that
everything will somehow turn out for the best, is hard to
warrant, hard to justify rationally. Optimism won’t really do.
Instead, we need something like the religious virtue of hope;
and hope and optimism are different. Hope is something
which is characteristically a religious virtue. It’s one of the
three traditional theological virtues: faith, hope, and love. Its
cultivation has to do with systematic patterns of spiritual
discipline. This is part of the great western tradition of
spirituality. We need more than just an unreasonable or jaunty
optimism. We need to cultivate in ourselves the moral and
spiritual basis for being able to live our lives in the face of
seeming absurdity and contingency, and all-too-frequent
failure. So that’s where the disciplines of spirituality come in.
Spirituality is not just a matter of having a metaphysical belief
that it’s all going to be fine in the next world. One of its crucial
elements is the interior cultivation of certain types of virtue.

NW: And are those virtues reliant on the metaphysical element? Do
you have to believe in God to engage in spiritual exercises that could give
you the emotional power to carry on in the face of absurdity?

JC: Well, in a recent book, The Spiritual Dimension, and in
the more recent Why Believe?, I address that question, the
relationship between praxis and belief.

NW: ‘Praxis’ being?

JC: Praxis is engagement in disciplines and traditions of
action and practice, for example, meditation, which are
aimed at the cultivation of the virtues we’ve been talking
about, such as hope. Many people think that belief comes
first—that in order to embark on a programme of spiritual
praxis you’ve first got to get all your beliefs sorted out. But
Blaise Pascal, the great seventeenth-century French philoso-
pher, thought that you should embark on the praxis, or
practice, first, and the faith would come later. And that seems
to me to be the right way round. You can’t secure your beliefs
in advance, because the sorts of things we’re talking about,
faith and hope and so on, come as a result of immersion in
traditions of spiritual praxis. They come, as it were, after
you’ve embarked on the path, further down the line, rather
than being secured in advance.

NW: If you were advising somebody reading this, what would be
the first steps you would recommend they take to find meaning in
their life?

JC: Well, I’m not sure I would presume to advise people in
general. There are, no doubt, many paths. I think people do
have to reflect on these issues of contingency. They will, in
any case, find it hard to avoid doing so if they are reasonably
interested in ideas. I’m not saying that only people who are
interested in the intellect or ideas can have a decent or worth-
while or meaningful life, but those that are—and that
includes a very large number of us in modern, educated
western society—must sooner or later reflect seriously on
how human life is limited, how many or most of our
endeavours are likely to be frustrated in the long run, and on
the fact that we’re not self-sufficient, wholly autonomous
creatures. In a phrase the philosopher Alasdair Macintyre has
used recently, we are ‘dependent rational animals’. He’s
talking there about Aristotle’s famous definition—‘man is a
rational animal’—while adding that crucial additional
property of being dependent.

NW: Dependent on what?

JC: Well, we didn’t create ourselves. We are dependent on
a whole host of conditions that have brought us into
existence—whether you believe those are just natural chains
of events or whether you believe our existence ultimately
depends, as traditional religious views have it, on some
divine source. But whichever way you look at it, we are
dependent on the causes that brought us into existence. We
are also dependent on other people, most strikingly when
we are children and later when we become elderly, but, in
fact, throughout our lives, in one way or another. We have
to live our lives against that backdrop. So part of what I try
to do in my book On the Meaning of Life is to push against
what I think are very arrogant conceptions of humanity, like
that of the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, who
seems to have thought we could somehow create our own
values by grand acts of will. It seems to me obvious that we
can’t create our own values. We’re born into circumstances
that we didn’t create. We have to find value within a given
cosmos, a world that is not of our making. So the first step
towards meaningfulness is humility—acknowledging the
fact of our dependency.

NW: I’d like to come back to the practical question, because you’re
advocating more than a purely intellectual engagement with ideas.
You’re saying philosophy should engage with how you live your life at the
level of spiritual exercise. But what does a spiritual exercise actually
look like?

JC: Let me give an analogy—that of psychoanalytic praxis.
A lot of analytic philosophers are very sceptical about
psychoanalysis, and I certainly wouldn’t want to defend all
the details of Freud’s elaborate theories. But one thing that
Freudian thought acknowledges is that we are dependent.
We don’t create our own minds by ourselves; they are shaped
and formed long before we become fully rational. Further-
more, we need to understand this and come to terms with
it—and the way to do so is through a course of praxis, of
guided self-discovery. That, I take to be the psychoanalytic
programme. You engage in a regular programme of discus-
sion with an interlocutor. You reflect, with guidance, on your
past, and you try to understand yourself better.

Spiritual practice is somewhat similar. Saint Augustine,
writing many centuries ago, at the close of the Roman
Empire, talked about each person having to descend into the
inner self where truth dwells. So religious meditation and the
practice involved in that—the spiritual programmes of
self-discovery—are not wholly unlike what goes on in
psychoanalytic practice. Philosophy too, at least according
to the Socratic tradition, is vitally connected with self-
awareness and self-knowledge. If we consider the three
modes of discourse comprising philosophy, psychoanalysis,
and religion, they make up what has often been thought of as
a triangle of hostility. Most philosophers are very hostile to
psychoanalysis, many religious people are suspicious of
psychoanalysis, and indeed many psychoanalytic thinkers
are against religion—Freud was notoriously critical of
religion. But I think there is a triangle of harmony here.
All three modes of discourse, properly understood, are
engaged in this deeper, traditional question of self-
understanding: the project of linking our theoretical
beliefs with understanding who we are and how we
should live, if we are to live meaningful lives.
