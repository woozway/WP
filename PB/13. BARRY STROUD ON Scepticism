METAPHYSICS AND MIND

BARRY STROUD ON
Scepticism

David Edmonds: Can I really know anything? If so, what can I know?
Epistemology—the study of knowledge—is a central concern in
philosophy. A sceptic says we can know nothing, or next-to-nothing.
Barry Stroud—Professor of Philosophy at the University of California at
Berkeley—isn’t a full-blown sceptic. But it’s common knowledge that
he’s a leading authority on scepticism.

Nigel Warburton: The topic I want to ask you about is scepticism.
In a sense, all philosophers are sceptics in that they doubt things. Could
you say what you understand by scepticism?

Barry Stroud: The kind of scepticism I am interested in
arises out of a very general philosophical enterprise: the
attempt to understand in general how human knowledge of
the world around us is possible. This can become a pressing
problem because there are various familiar considerations
which, when generalized, seem to count against the possi-
bility of any knowledge of the world at all. And trying to
show how those obstacles can be overcome turns out to be
more difficult than it might have seemed. Scepticism is the
conclusion that those obstacles cannot be overcome and that
we cannot really know anything about the world.

NW: I can see you now, you’re sitting in front of me. It’s hard to be
sceptical about your existence. Could you elaborate a little bit on where
the difficulties lie with that kind of perceptual encounter that we’re
having?

BS: I think that is the right way to pose the question,
because I believe the real source of the kind of scepticism
I am interested in lies in a certain understanding of percep-
tion, of how you actually do see me, or what kind of knowl-
edge you can have of my presence on the basis of what you
now see. This, of course, is the way Descartes raised the
problem in the seventeenth century.

NW: Descartes entertained sceptical arguments in order to get to
something which he thought was the bedrock on which he could build his
edifice of knowledge. So, in a sense, he was a pre-emptive sceptic: he was
getting the sceptics before they got him. He argued that the senses are
notoriously unreliable, so that just because I think I see you in front of
me it doesn’t follow that you really are in front of me.

BS: Yes. It was part of Descartes’s task to get the senses out
of the picture as a source of knowledge; to show that they are
not the source of knowledge that people have supposed them
to be. As you have just said, one way to challenge the senses
as a source of knowledge is to point out that they are not
necessarily reliable. We can go wrong by relying on our
senses. Descartes mentions that. But it seems equally true
that we also rely on our senses to check up on our senses: we
can undo some of the mistakes we might have made earlier.
So Descartes’s doubts about the reliability of the senses do
not ultimately rest simply on the fact that sometimes the
senses lead us astray.

Where I live, by the sea in California, the weather is very
mild. When I go out in the morning my car starts every
time. But if I go up into the mountains in the winter and try
to start my car in the morning, I cannot rely on it starting
every time. The conditions under which I am trying to start
it are different. I know that, and it doesn’t make me conclude
that my car is generally unreliable. Descartes says the same
thing about the senses. I can sometimes go wrong on the
basis of the senses alone when things are too far away, for
instance, or when they are close but too small to be seen
properly. But that does not make me think that I can never
rely on the senses, even when clearly visible things are in
front of me in the light of day. But there are considerations
that do seem to bring into doubt the reliability of the senses
in general for finding out anything about the world.

NW: So, what are those considerations?

BS: Well, suppose it could be shown that on each and every
occasion on which I take myself to be perceiving that
something or other is so in the world, I could be perceiving
what I perceive on that occasion even though the world I think
I am perceiving is not in fact the way it seems to me to be. One
possibility of this that Descartes does not mention, but others
have mentioned, is that whenever I have a perception of
something I am actually having a hallucination. So things in
the world would not really be the way they seem to me to be.
That perhaps raises the question whether you could be
hallucinating all the time, or whether a hallucination is
something that can occur only some of the time.

What Descartes himself introduces is the possibility that
you are dreaming. That is certainly something familiar to all
of us. When we dream it seems to us at the time that we are,
say, walking along beside the river, whereas we are in fact
lying in a dark room in bed. Perceptually, it is exactly as if
I am walking by the river, but I am not. So to know that I am
walking by the river, even when I am actually walking there,
it seems as if I would have to find some reason to believe that
I am not dreaming. Can I ever dismiss the possibility that
I am merely dreaming that I am by the river on the basis of
anything I could perceive at that moment?

NW: So he’s looking for some kind of marker that indicates that the
present perceptions are genuinely of the world and not of a dream.

BS: That’s a good way to put it, in terms of a ‘marker’ or
some recognizable feature of my perception. And the
problem is that whatever could be present in my perception
that might seem to indicate to me that I am not dreaming
seems to be something that could also be present in any
dream experience. For example, suppose I was told that
when you are looking at something and see a little red dot in
the lower right-hand corner of your visual field, this is an
indication that you are not dreaming. The red dot is the sign
of reality. Well, surely there is nothing to prevent you from
dreaming and finding a little red dot in the lower right-hand
corner of your dream experience.

NW: Now, that seems pretty powerful. Do you think he was right that
every experience could in principle be contained within a dream?

BS: That is a huge and complicated question. In fact, there
are two different questions here. Is it possible for there to be
something in one’s perceptual experience at a given moment
that could reliably indicate to you that you are not dreaming
at that moment? That’s one question. Many people who see
the force of this consideration—as you do—would say no,
there could not. But some would go on to say that that is
okay because you do not have to know that you are not
dreaming at a particular moment in order to have perceptual
knowledge of the world at that time. That is because
knowing that you are not dreaming is not required in
general in order for you to have reliable perceptual knowl-
edge of the world.

NW: So, I’m dreaming that I’m in this room talking to you—or I
might be dreaming that—and I don’t know at the moment whether I’m
dreaming or not: how can I then be sure that I have some knowledge of
anything beyond the dream?

BS: Well, this second line of defence that I have distin-
guished says that you do not have to know that you’re not
dreaming in order to know by perception what is going on
around you. As long as you actually are perceiving what’s
going on around you, and it is connected in the right way
with your perceiving it, then you do or can know what is so.
That is to say, you can satisfy the conditions of knowing how
things are in the world—so you know—even though it is not
a condition of knowing something that you know that you
know it. There are things we know that perhaps we don’t
know that we know. But that does not mean that we do not
know them.

So this diagnosis says that the sceptical conclusion that we
don’t know anything about the world rests on a faulty or
unjustified assumption. It assumes that if you do not know
that you know a certain thing, then you do not know it. This
response says that is a misconception of the nature of
knowledge.

NW: We’ve got quite abstract. We’re engaging in philosophical debate,
and somebody who’s not a philosopher will say: ‘I know I’m not
dreaming, so what’s the point of discussing a case like this?’

BS: Well, yes. The abstraction or generality of the discus-
sion raises a question about the nature or the point of this
philosophical enterprise. You could think of philosophy in
this respect as a kind of very high-level anthropology. It’s as
if we try to stand back and look at human beings in general
and see how they function. We see them and we see the
world that they operate in, and we want to understand how
they have knowledge of that world. And we see that sense
perception is obviously very important for knowledge. But
human beings also have many other concerns in life, like
getting on and living with one another, and so on. So
knowledge is not the only thing human beings are inter-
ested in—thank goodness. But that does not mean that
whenever things go smoothly with people saying things and
accepting and relying on the things that others say, they
really do know the things they think they do. We have not
necessarily understood whether or how human beings
actually know the sorts of things they think they do, or
whether they just happen to get some things right about the
way things are.

Knowing something is not the same thing as believing
something and its being true. You can have true beliefs and
not know the things in question; you could make a lucky
guess, for example. If someone flips a coin and one person
thinks it is going to be heads and another thinks it is going
to be tails, one of them has to be right, but neither of them
knows. So, if we distinguish knowledge from true belief
and see that it involves something more, the question is,
what is that something more? And is this ‘something more’
present in what we ordinarily take to be cases of knowl-
edge? That is what is in question in this kind of philosophi-
cal enterprise. If I do see something, and the world is
actually the way I see it to be, that does not by itself give
me knowledge on this conception of knowledge because I
might just happen to be perceiving something that is
exactly the way things are. In order to have knowledge, I
have to see that things are the way they are and in some
sense know that they are that way, and that’s where the
problem comes from.

NW: So another way of looking at this is that the philosophical
enterprise of investigating sceptical arguments in this way is actually an
attempt to understand the human condition: we’re trying to get an
overview of just how we relate to the world.

BS: That’s right, and it is very important. That is the kind of
enterprise I am calling a completely general anthropological
investigation of the human species. In everyday life, we are
concerned with finding out certain things and getting on
with people, and whether we have knowledge or not is not
always the primary concern. But in the philosophical
enterprise of understanding knowledge, those more practical
concerns are put to one side for the moment. We want to
gain a certain kind of detached intellectual understanding of
a fundamental aspect of human life. What we really want to
understand is part of the human condition: what does it take
for human beings to be knowers of the world around them,
and do they succeed?

NW: As a philosopher, you are almost obliged to be a sceptic to some
degree, or at least to entertain sceptical arguments—because otherwise
you’re just a dogmatist, presumably. Is that a fair assessment?

BS: As a philosopher you try to understand various aspects
of the human condition, and you try to do that while
presupposing as little as possible yourself. You don’t want to
take any more for granted than you have to for the purpose
at hand. But that kind of caution or doubt is not the kind of
scepticism that appears to be the outcome of this philosophi-
cal enterprise. The scepticism that comes out of this enter-
prise is much stronger than that. It is not just a matter of
doubting or being cautious or not taking many things for
granted. It is the paradoxical conclusion that nobody knows
anything about the world around them.

Now in that sense, almost no philosophers are sceptics.
I think the considerations that seem to lead to that sceptical
conclusion are powerful and still not correctly understood.
My zeal in drawing attention to the force of those arguments
has led some people to think of me as a defender of scepticism.
That of course is absurd; it would mean that I think nobody
knows anything about the world at all. But I do think that
trying to get to the bottom of the considerations that seem to
lead to that sceptical conclusion, and trying to find out how
and why that conclusion cannot be reached, or even what the
obstacles are to reaching it, would be a great contribution to
the understanding of one fundamental aspect of the human
condition. That is the kind of interest it has for me.
