ETHICS

SIMON BLACKBURN ON
Relativism

David Edmonds: What’s ethically acceptable for Muslims may not be
acceptable for Christians. What’s seen as morally acceptable in
Manchester may not be alright in Mogadishu. You may think capital
punishment or euthanasia is wrong: I may disagree. We’re tempted to
think that morality is relative—that we can resolve moral disputes as we
resolve disputes in other areas. In history, say, we might argue about the
date of the Battle of Hastings; in maths we might challenge a proof—but
we think there’s a definitive answer to such disagreements. Which raises
the question—is the realm of morality different, are morals relative?
The man to answer this question is one of Britain’s leading moral
philosophers, Professor Simon Blackburn.

Nigel Warburton: The topic I want to discuss is moral relativism.
Could you sketch out what you understand by that term?

Simon Blackburn: Moral relativism is a position that
intri gues even if it doesn’t attract people. It starts with
the elementary observation that there are different
sensibilities—people react differently, morally, to different
things. Some people think abortion is permissible, others
think it’s not. Some people think that assisted euthanasia is
permissible, others think it isn’t. Some people think the will
of Allah has to be done, other people don’t think it’s of any
relevance. So you have different views, different positions,
and the potential for conflict, obviously. The question then
arises, can we defend the idea of one single moral truth in the
face of all this diversity? Or is the diversity a sign that there
isn’t really a single moral truth, rather as people think, in
matters of taste, that there isn’t a single truth?

NW: In the area of taste people frequently say, ‘It’s all subjective’.
What you’ve described sounded like what’s often called subjectivism. Do
you see subjectivism as a variety of relativism or the core of it?

SB: It’s a variety of it. The subjectivist is a relativist because
he will think as the relativist does that I can say truly that
abortion is permissible, let’s say, and you can say truly that
it’s not, and we each have our own truth. And the subjectivist
protects that idea by saying ‘I’m describing my own reaction.
I’m saying of myself that I approve of abortion, and you’re
saying of yourself that you don’t. And then those two
remarks are compatible, they could each be true. Just as I like
toothpaste with a mint flavour, and you don’t.’

NW: So relativism would be any theory which encapsulates the idea
that there are individual differences in morality (for which there may be
a cultural explanation) and that there are no absolute truths about any
moral judgements that we make. The statement ‘Torturing babies is
wrong’ is subjective; it’s just a matter of taste.

SB: That’s pretty much it, yes. That’s a very good thumbnail
definition. As the example of subjectivism shows, it can then
be worked out in various ways. But the core idea has to
remain that I’ve got my truth, you’ve got your truth, and
there’s no metaphysical—or absolute, as you put it—norm or
value knocking about in the universe that I’m getting right
and you’re getting wrong or vice versa.

NW: So is it true? Is moral relativism actually an accurate picture of
the nature of morality?

SB: I argue no, it’s not true. The reason it’s not true is that it
doesn’t do justice to the fact of disagreement and conflict.
That is, if I think that abortion is right or permissible and you
think it never is, we’ve got a disagreement, and it’s a dis-
agreement that could lead to conflict, and in serious cases
moral disagreement can lead to war. That’s not like ‘I like
mint toothpaste’ and ‘I don’t’ in different mouths where you
just say ‘Okay, sure, live and let live, de gustibus non est
disputandum’.1 You just can’t say that in the moral case. If I
think that fox-hunting with dogs is absolutely wrong, and
you think that it’s an admirable part of English country life,
then we’ve got a political disagreement on our hands. The
relativist doesn’t do justice to that because he says ‘you’ve got
your truth and I’ve got mine’—end of story. But the trouble
is, it’s not the end of the story because we’re each seeking to
impose a policy on the other.

NW: In some cases where there is disagreement, there are facts which,
if they become known, resolve the issue. Is that what you’re saying
morality is like?

SB: Well, not quite. My position gets rather complicated
here. There are, for example, people called ‘moral realists’
who think there must be a fact: either fox-hunting is right or
it’s not right and it’s our job to find out which. And they see
that as a kind of metaphysical commitment: there’s a moral
reality and their problem is making sense of that. I take a
more pragmatic view. I say, look, whether or not there’s such
a moral reality—and let’s just shunt that to one side for the
moment—we’re going to have disagreement, we’re going to
have conflict and we’re going to need to know what to
do—we’re going perhaps to be conflicted in our own minds
about things: should I allow my teenage son or daughter to
do this, that, or the other? That’s got nothing to do with the
attempt to get a moral reality right. It has everything to do
with an attempt to work out how to live, to work out a plan
or a scheme for living. And I think it’s the same with more
serious moral disagreements. So I would defend the practical
importance of thinking about ethics on pragmatic grounds,
not on the grounds that we’re attempting to describe a moral
reality which is a rather mysterious, ontological denizen of
the universe.

NW: A moral relativist would probably say that female circumcision
is acceptable for certain cultural groups: it’s right for them, it’s wrong for
us. That doesn’t give any clue as to how you might resolve the conflict
between those two different groups, how you would apply the pragmatic
idea faced with a cultural relativist like that.

SB: Well, often the kind of remark you just cited is a plea for
live and let live, or toleration, or possibly even an injunction
that we have no right to interfere, we mustn’t interfere,
there’s something wrong about imposing our will on other
people. I think that’s only partially true. It’s sometimes true
that we shouldn’t impose our will. But in some cases I’m not
sure it’s true at all. For example, the female-circumcision
case, where I think it’s quite legitimate for people to feel that
the treatment is so degrading and so misogynistic in various
ways and does such damage to people that we do become
very uncomfortable about just standing aside and letting it
happen.

NW: There’s a famous knock-down argument against the kind of
moral relativism that we’ve been discussing. This is that most moral
relativists believe absolutely that relativism is true, so they’re inconsist-
ent in some way: they both believe that every judgement is relative, but
also that the judgement ‘every judgement is relative’ is itself absolutely
true, so not relative.

SB: Yes, that’s a very good old argument. It’s the so-called
‘Peritrope’ of Plato from the Theaetetus. I think it’s a doubtful
argument myself. It’s too quick. And the obvious response is
for the relativist to say: ‘Look, I don’t put forward, for
example, non-toleration or even my own relativism, as an
absolute position, I don’t believe in absolute positions, I just
told you I think everything is relative. So I’m quite happy to
admit that status for my own position. That means it’s no
better or worse than other things. But then you have to take
it as it appears to you. And my persuasive ambition is to
persuade you that the right way to think about it is that
everything is relative.’

NW: So how would you characterize your own position? What name
is it usually known by?

SB: It’s an unlovely title that I landed myself with, but it has
stuck. I’m called a quasi-realist. And what that suggests is
that, without going metaphysical—as I say, I don’t believe
with starting with the idea of a moral reality—it is justifiable
to talk in terms of disagreement, in terms of attempts to find
solutions, attempts to come to one mind and to worry how
I’m to live my life. All those are genuine concerns, and
genuine phenomena. And the relativist is really trying to
undermine something in our practices, and I want to defend
our practices. I want to defend the seriousness with which
we take moral disagreement and try to resolve it. So it’s ‘as if’
you’ve got a moral reality which it is our job to find,
although that picture is, I think, only a picture.

NW: Take the debate about multiculturalism—a major issue in
Britain. Some people say that toleration has gone too far, that what we’ve
been doing is tolerating many intolerant people, with devastating results.
Does your approach have anything to say about multiculturalism?

SB: I don’t think it directly speaks to it. But my approach
would be very hospitable to the possibility that we’ve gone
too far. Do we allow people complete licence in modes of
behaviour or modes of speech or do we clamp down?
Obviously the pendulum can swing—you can go far too far
in either direction. And equally obviously, it’s a complicated
matter of political judgement, whether at any particular time
we’ve gone too far one way or too far the other.

NW: And do you think philosophers have got anything that they can
add to that debate, or are they just commentating on the sidelines, like
sports commentators?

SB: I do rather tend to the second view. Although I believe
wholeheartedly in the practice of moral debate, and I think
there are very serious questions we have to tackle, like, for
example, the limits of toleration, I’m rather sceptical about
the existence of expertise, or expertise across the board.
There are things philosophers can bring to the debate.
Traditional virtues of clarity and care, knowing when it’s an
empirical problem, knowing when it’s a moral disagreement,
and things like that. But I do jib at the idea of moral exper-
tise. And certainly, if you come to the philosopher for
solutions in any moderately complicated political arena,
you’ll just find that you’ve got a dozen philosophers and
thirteen solutions, as they say about economists. That’s a
result of the fact that, fundamentally, morality is a deep
expression of personality, and of plans for living, plans for the
body politic that we admire—and people will differ. So we
go back to the relativist starting-point—people will differ.

NW: You’ve described yourself as a quasi-realist and said that
although debates on moral issues are real debates at some level there’s no
objective truth about how they should be resolved. How, then, do you
explain how these moral disagreements are genuine disagreements?

SB: Well, at one level that’s quite easy. Take a non-moral
case. Suppose we have to decide where to go on holiday and
you say ‘let’s go to the mountains’ and I say ‘let’s go to the
seaside’. Then we’ve got a disagreement, and it’s a real
disagreement, assuming we can only go to one, and we have
either to bargain, or negotiate, or work through it, and give
each other reasons for preferring the one to the other. And of
course eventually it could lead to conflict or, in the case of
partners, divorce. So in practical matters, just as much as in
theoretical matters, disagreement is very often the name of
the game. Similarly, if I want people to go on fox-hunting and
you want them not to, then just at the level of desire we’ve
got a disagreement and you could be expected to act to
prevent fox-hunting and I act to promote it. We’ve got
policies that are in conflict and we might come to blows, as
people do. So disagreement is not too problematic, and if you
see the relativist as trying to somehow wish it away, then the
position does begin to look silly, impractical. Suppose you
say ‘Fox-hunting Yes!’ and I say ‘Fox-hunting No!’, and in
comes Rosy The Relativist, and she says ‘Hey you two, why
don’t you just realize that fox-hunting is good for Nigel and
bad for Simon and that’s the end of it?’ The question I want to
ask is, ‘How does this help?’ Whatever led me to oppose
fox-hunting is presumably still there; whatever led you to
admire it or wish to tolerate it is still there. The idea that
we’re not in conflict just starts to look farcical. And the
conflict has not been resolved by Rosy—it hasn’t even been
helped.
