DEREK MATRAVERS ON
The Definition of Art

David Edmonds: It used to be so easy. Rembrandt painted art, so did
da Vinci, Botticelli, Rubens, Constable, Vermeer. Beautiful paintings
were art. No argument. But then came Marcel Duchamp and what he
called ‘Fountain’—a urinal—a so-called ‘ready-made’, which appeared
in a 1917 show. In more recent times, British artist Tracey Emin exhibited
an unmade bed; Damien Hirst immersed a tiger shark in formaldehyde.
Are these art? It seems absurd to deny that they are—since they were
exchanged for eye-watering sums of money and were displayed in
respected art galleries. But, if so, were they art merely because they were
somehow linked to the art world—and because the art world deemed
them art? Is that good enough? Not according to Derek Matravers, of the
Open University—author of Art and Emotion.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we’re going to focus on is the definition
of art. The definition of art has a history—could you give us some
background on where the idea of art came from in the first place?

Derek Matravers: According to the art historian Paul
Kristeller, the fine arts as we now know them, which are
things like paintings and sculpture and music, were scattered
conceptually prior to about the 1740s. So, for example, music
was linked to mathematics; others of the fine arts were
linked to engineering, or what they would call engineering
in those days. Then, in the 1740s, a French thinker called the
Abbé Batteaux has this idea that you could group these
things together as the fine arts, and that’s where we get our
modern concept of art from.

NW: So you’re saying one person almost single-handedly invented art?

DM: Yes, although you need to think about the context at
the time. What’s recognized as one of the first novels,
Pamela, by Richardson, had only been published a few years
before; the Enlightenment was in full swing, people had
more leisure time. It was a period of great conceptual
innovation anyway; somebody was going to do it. So it
wasn’t just a single man sitting in his office, it was part of a
larger current.

NW: Now there are obviously things which we would call art that
existed before this time. So what we’re saying is conceptually they
weren’t grouped together beforehand. What was it that allowed this
man to group them together? What was the essence of art for him?

DM: He came up with two things. First he said—and this
was probably a mistake—art is the imitation of nature. It was
a mistake because there are plenty of things that even he
thought of as the fine arts that just don’t fit that. But the
main idea he had was that these things were a cause of
pleasure—they caused in the audience certain mental states
which they can enjoy for their own sake. The name he gave
to that was pleasure.

NW: Let’s focus on the visual arts, because that’s simpler; we can
follow them through the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. With the
visual arts it’s not absurd to think of the eighteenth-century visual arts
as being representations which have aesthetic beauty.

DM: That’s right. Beauty comes into it very quickly. For
fairly obvious reasons, pleasure turns out to be a rather
inadequate characterization of the mental state to which
these fine arts give rise. So, we take pleasure in having hot
showers and sipping coffee and things like that, and you
think that the mental state involved with the arts is more
complicated. The German Enlightenment philosopher
Immanuel Kant wrote three great books of philosophy. The
third book, The Critique of Judgement, gave a much more
nuanced account of the mental state that arises from our
perception of beauty.

So, we have two things here: we have a complicated
mental state, which is connected to, but more complex than,
pleasure, and a new word—to name those things in the
world that cause this mental state, ‘beauty’. It wasn’t a new
word of course, but the link was new. So, beautiful objects
were objects that cause this complicated mental state, this
aesthetic experience.

NW: For Kant, there’s a strong formal element, in the sense that the
pattern of shapes and lines were what determined whether something
was beautiful or not.

DM: That’s right. He thought that it’s absurd to say ‘This is
beautiful for me’. You can say that you like it, but if you’re
claiming that an object is beautiful, then what you’re doing is
asking other people to agree with you. So Kant had this
problem. He wanted to say that judgements of beauty were
universal: everybody ought to go with them. On the other
hand, the account simply in terms of pleasure made them
very individual. So what he did, and this is a very simple
thought, was to take out of the judgement of beauty any-
thing that might pertain to anybody as an individual and
focus on those things which everybody could see in com-
mon. He took this to be the object’s form. So, he abstracted
out colour—because you might prefer red and I might prefer
green—he abstracted out everything, except those formal
elements in order to get to universal judgements.

NW: Let’s fast-forward to the end of the nineteenth century, beginning
of the twentieth century, when there’s a strong move in the visual arts
towards abstraction: moving away from this idea of representing nature
as it is, the emphasis on the brushstrokes, gradually moving towards a
total abstraction which didn’t relate directly to anything visual in the
world. Another aspect of that is Marcel Duchamp’s ready-mades, where
he found existing objects and placed them in galleries and these were
recognized as works of art. How can the traditional aesthetic approach
to art, art as beauty, cope with these cases?

DM: You’re quite right, there was a crisis, and it is normally
dated to about 1912–14. There are various accounts of what
caused this crisis. One of them is that if we go back to the
idea of the visual arts representing the world, well lo and
behold photography and movies turn up that can represent
the world a whole lot better than can painting, so art goes
into a crisis. I think an element of that is true, but I don’t
really believe all of it, for the reason that I don’t think that
artists prior to 1914 thought of their primary job as represent-
ing the world. But certainly there was a break from beauty;
so these objects were being included in the world of the arts
even though they were not beautiful. The definition of art
either had to be abandoned or expanded in order to accom-
modate these new objects.

NW: It’s almost as if some artists, particularly Duchamp, were
deliberately attacking a past conception of what art had been.

DM: Yes, that’s right. The term that described the intellectual
current at the time was modernism. Again, like the Enlighten-
ment, there was a huge revolution in thought, and there were
huge changes in art as well as in a lot of other things.

NW: Coming back to the philosophy though, how do we cope with this
change? Can we give an adequate definition of art that encompasses both
traditional art, visual art of the eighteenth century and afterwards, and
the radical new kinds of art of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries?

DM: Well, a couple of philosophers, Arthur Danto and
George Dickie, both of whom were American, came up with a
rather neat idea. They claimed that works of art were objects
that were linked to a particular social practice. Suppose that
you look out at the car park and see two objects: a picture and
a Japanese motorbike. They may both be beautiful objects, but
what makes the picture a work of art is that it’s linked to the
art world and the motorbike is not linked to the art world. So
these social links came to define art.

NW: It’s important to be clear about what ‘the art world’ means in
this context. It’s not just people who happen to work in galleries, who
have positions or power in various institutions; for Dickie certainly, it’s
a much wider category—so that anybody who thinks they’re a member
of the art world automatically is. Anyone who wants to be an artist is,
by that fact, a member of the art world.

DM: Yes. Different people have different things to say about
what exactly they mean by the art world. You’re quite right
that Dickie’s definition was extraordinarily wide. The
definition another American philosopher, Jerrold Levinson,
comes up with—which is to think of the art world as the
historical tradition of making art—is probably a better one to
which to link the objects.

NW: Let’s take the example of Duchamp’s Fountain—which was a
signed, factory-produced urinal. How could that be a work of art? The
original has been lost, but Duchamp made some authenticated copies
which are now in Tate Modern, the Beaubourg Centre, and various
places around the world. How can those be works of art?

DM: The difference between Duchamp’s urinal and a
common-or-garden urinal is that Duchamp linked his urinal
to the art world, and that’s what makes it a work of art. So, to
take George Dickie’s account of the link, something is a work
of art if firstly it’s an artefact, and secondly some person or
persons acting on behalf of the art world have put it forward
as a candidate for appreciation. So what we can see here is
Duchamp putting this urinal forward as a candidate for
appreciation, and that’s what makes this urinal art and the
other urinals not art.

NW: Yet you’ve got some worries about the institutional theory, at
least in the simple terms that we’ve discussed it.

DM: Yes. Richard Wollheim, who was a prominent British
aesthetician of the last half of the last century, came up with
a dilemma for the institutional theory. He said: ‘Well, either
people have reasons for putting these objects forward as art
or they don’t. And if they have a reason it’s the reasons we
should be interested in, because those are what makes the
object art. If they don’t have reasons, then we have an
entirely uninteresting theory because all we would have
would be some arbitrary collection of objects.’ This dilemma
did seem to stymie the institutional theory for a while, and I
think it’s widely thought to have refuted the theory. But I’m
not sure that the dilemma really works.

Go back to one of Dickie’s earliest analogies: what is the
difference between a married person and an unmarried
person? It’s not going to be a difference in their physical
constitution. What it is, is that one of them has been
through a process. And that, says Dickie, is similar to works
of art: works of art have been through this kind of institu-
tionalized process. But although it’s true that there’s no
single reason which will explain why everybody who is
married is married—people get married for different
reasons—it is nonetheless true that for everybody who is
married there is some reason why they got married. That is
what the institutionalists should have said to Wollheim:
‘Fine, there’s no single reason for putting forward objects as
works of art. But for each object, there will be some reason
or other why it rather than some other object has been put
forward.’

NW: So you’re saying that some ready-made could be selected because
it’s beautiful or because it seems to be an ironic comment on capitalist
society—there could be a range of reasons why any particular work was
within a gallery?

DM: Yes. The good thing about this thought is that you can
incorporate all the reasons that existed in the past. You can
say Rembrandt’s paintings are works of art and the reason
that they’re works of art is that they’re paintings. Duchamp’s
urinal is a work of art, the reason it’s a work of art is because
of some mental act or some act of conferral that Duchamp
performed. What you’re saying is something like this, ‘This
is a work of art because of x’, and then you give reasons.
Which reasons? Well, whatever reasons happen to be
operative in the art world at the time.

So take some of the reasons we have now. It seems to be
building on the legacy of Duchamp that there are artists—and
I’ve heard Tracey Emin and Damien Hirst, two modern British
artists, say this in interviews—who think that as they’re
artists, their word is enough to make something a work of art.
So you say to them, why is this a work of art? They say, ‘I’m an
artist and I’ve just laid hands on this and made it a work of art.’
Now that seems to me to be a reason currently operative in
the art world, and in my opinion that reason is not defensible. I
think that’s just a bit of cultural silliness.

NW: So, you’re rejecting this idea of artists having the Midas touch,
and what you’re replacing it with is a notion that there have to be
reasons for choices. There have to be reasons to select one object as a
work of art and to reject another. But who’s to judge which reasons
count?

DM: That, I think, is the crucial question. Because what we
get here is the revenge of Richard Wollheim. Wollheim’s
initial accusation was that if they adopt one of the forks, the
institutional theorists just end up with an arbitrary collection
of objects. If they follow my line, they’re able to defeat that,
but what they end up with is a collection of objects for what
I’m sure Wollheim would have said is an arbitrary collection
of reasons. Because what still makes such an approach
institutional is that the collection of reasons that we appeal to
are just whichever reasons are currently operative in the art
world. I think philosophers should get in there and dispute
the reasons that are operative in the art world. The art world
gets away with not defending those reasons.

NW: Do you think that would lead to clearer evaluations of the
relative merits of artworks?

DM: Yes, I think it would. We need to return to a position
where people can tell stories about why they’re interested in
particular works of art that are convincing in the following
respect: they will convince people to spend time engaging
with them and get some kind of rich experience out of them.
For example, I don’t know if you have ever settled down to
work out how many free Saturdays afternoons you have left
in the rest of your life. Once you get to my middle age, it’s a
really rather small number, an alarmingly small number.
Now if we’re going to take one of those Saturday afternoons
and spend it in an art gallery, then some story needs to be
told about why that’s a worthwhile use of that time.
