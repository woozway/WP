JULIAN SAVULESCU ON
'Yuk!'

David Edmonds: Is there any word more onomatopoeic than ‘Yuk!’?
‘Yuk!’ expresses repugnance, disgust, abhorrence. The thought of a
genetically tampered-with mouse with a human ear on its back evokes, in
many people, a sense of Yuk! The idea of eating a human corpse draws the
same response. But how much weight should we give to these feelings of Yuk!
when we’re trying to work out what’s right and wrong? Julian Savulescu is
Director of Oxford University’s Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we’re going to focus on is ‘Yuk!’ or the
‘Yuk!’ factor. Could you just say what that means? What is the ‘Yuk!’
factor?

Julian Savulescu: Everyone is familiar with disgusting taste,
you taste something extremely bitter and you go ‘Yuk!’ But
in many cases we see or think about some particular ethical
issue and we have exactly the same disgust response. Typical
examples are when people think about cannibalism, about
abortion, incest, or even having sex with animals: people
have intuitive feelings of revulsion or disgust to those sorts
of practices.

NW: These reactions are pretty widespread; is there some biological
explanation of why we should have such feelings?

JS: Many of us are familiar with having disgust reactions.
If you ever had food-poisoning—I had food-poisoning from
some sausages once and I always felt sick when I thought
about eating sausages, I couldn’t eat them for many years—
and many of these disgust reactions are evolutionarily
programmed in order to protect us from toxins or adverse
situations. For example, the revulsion to incest has a very
good biological reason; you’re much more likely to have a
genetically abnormal child with a relative. So, many of the
taboos have a strong biological basis; if you like, a quasi-
rational basis. Some of them embody a kind of intuitive
social form of knowledge, of practices that we’ve found in the
past to be disadvantageous to human beings. So, our disgust
reaction represents the expression of that knowledge.

NW: So what you’re saying is that there is more than one type of
‘Yuk!’ reaction, sometimes it’s genetics; or sometimes as with your
sausages you have a bad experience and thereafter you’re afraid of
sausages—so that’s a learnt reaction.

JS: It can also be learnt at a social level and it can be passed
on through generations via a social form of knowledge.
Many of the taboos and norms are socially determined from
practices that were disadvantageous to groups. So, there are
some very good bases for our ‘Yuk!’ reactions. But in many
cases, they either express a personal disgust or misfire in the
sense that they are applied to a situation that is no longer
disadvantageous to us. As I said, my reaction to sausages
persisted long after there were safe sausages available.

For example, with incest, we now have very good genetic
tests that would pick up genetic abnormality. So, if that was
the basis for the adverse reaction to incest, we can now in
modern society counter that. The challenge of modern ethics
today is not simply to sit with our intuitions, because our
intuitions are not necessarily reliable guides to what we
should do. We need to examine what we should do and what
our reasons for actions are in a particular case. Take an
example: many people would have a ‘Yuk!’ reaction to
creating human or non-human animals, chimeras or hybrids.
They have visions of planet of the apes or the chimeras of
antiquity, the centaur, the sphinx, and so on.

But when we’re considering what science is actually
proposing, of creating embryos as a source of stem cells, and
where those embryos would be destroyed after fourteen
days, we need to look at what the reasons specifically are for
that particular practice. We can’t simply look at our ‘Yuk!’
reactions. They are very crude rules of thumb that have
served us in our primitive past, but are simply ill-equipped
to deal with complexities and the nuances of particular
situations in today’s life.

NW: What would you say to somebody who says, ‘Look, actually our
reason-giving is pretty crude, too. It’s a kind of rationalization after the
fact; most people end up rationalizing their deepest prejudices and
probably their “Yuk!” reactions at some level’?

JS: That’s a very good point. Many people do use ethical
arguments simply to rationalize their intuitive responses. A
famous psychologist, Jonathan Haidt, used a scenario around
incest where he kept probing participants in the experiment
for their reason for their objections. Whatever reasons they
offered, whether it was genetic disability or harm to other
members of the family, or paedophilia, he countered these
reasons by saying the situation won’t be like that, and he
went on to give an explanation why not. However, they
stuck to their intuitive objection to it, regardless of how
invalid their supposed reason was. In the end, they couldn’t
offer any other reasons, except that they intuitively had a
‘Yuk!’ reaction to it. So, there’s certainly that phenomenon.

But secular ethics, not ethics based on religious codes, is
only half-a-century old really. The challenge is to find
reasons that aren’t just intuitive. So, reasons to do with
people’s well-being or reasons to do with rights, or reasons to
do with freedom, are reasons that aren’t just based on our
intuitions; we think that there’s something more substantial
behind those sorts of values. So the challenge is to find
values that aren’t just grounded on individual feelings but are
grounded on some ethical principle or value that’s defensible.

NW: Yet when it comes to ethics committees, quite often things I’ve
read are basically ‘Yuk!’ reactions. They say, ‘Well, that’s just disgust-
ing. That’s a kind of Frankenstein approach’—a whole lot of trigger
words that seem to be synonyms for ‘I find that repugnant’.

JS: That’s certainly correct. Much ethical discourse still
operates at a fairly intuitive primitive level. We saw this in
the 1950s or ’60s with the debate around homosexuality:
many people thought that this threatened the moral fabric of
society or that it was just disgusting and that homosexuality
should never be legalized. Fortunately we moved ahead of
that when we found we couldn’t find good reasons to create
or to sustain a legal ban on homosexuality within the privacy
of people’s homes. That’s been a good thing and a triumph
for ethical thought and reason over emotions, because the
sorts of arguments that were provided there probably had
some evolutionary basis, they probably did express some
attitudes that had served us in the past, but simply had no
place in modern society.

We resolve these issues through rational discourse,
through examining our emotional reactions and our
intuitions, and we attempt to provide reasons for our policies
and that’s how it should be. We should strive to do that
better, rather than descending to a kind of democratic
approach to ethics where we take a vote as to how people
respond, how much ‘Yuk!’ there is out there in a population
towards that particular practice.

NW: Emotions are obviously very important in our moral behaviour;
some people might caricature our discussion so far as, you are simply
defending the power of reason. But where does emotion come in if it
doesn’t come in through these powerful intuitions?

JS: In many circumstances we have to think quickly and we
have to rely on rough rules of thumb: so we have to rely on
our immediate emotional responses. Sometimes they help us
to act quickly and accurately in complex situations; in some
circumstances, they provide a guide to actions; in some
cases, it’s important to have certain emotional reactions in
certain social circumstances. So if somebody threatens you,
it might be important to get angry in order to respond in the
right way: it might not be the right thing to turn the other
cheek. Lastly, emotions are probably the most important part
of our lives, so how we feel about things is incredibly
important. We have to take account of that in deciding what
the best course of action is.

But ethics is not just emotions: at some point we have to
stand above them and critically reflect. I was originally a
doctor, and everyone feels revulsion when they have to see a
termination of pregnancy. It’s a natural human response.
There would be something abnormal with you if you were a
human who didn’t have that sort of emotional response to
the destruction of human life. But does that mean we can
settle the issue of whether abortion is right or wrong by
looking at how we feel about it? I don’t think so.

NW: Does it follow from what you’re saying that all of us should
critically examine our own ‘Yuk!’ reactions, to see where our particular
biases lie in this respect?

JS: I think we should start by acknowledging how we feel
about situations and understand why we feel that way about
them. But we should seek to reflect on that and decide
whether there are reasons that overcome our feelings and
direct us to some other course of action. My father died in
hospital and I’ve seen autopsies performed and I didn’t want
him to have an autopsy after his death. But after reflecting, I
asked for an autopsy report because I thought it was impor-
tant that we understood why he died. So, I think it’s impor-
tant in our lives to go one step beyond just acknowledging
our feelings and ask: ‘Are there are any good reasons for or
against that course of action that may differ from how we
feel about it?’

NW: Are there any particular moral issues of the day at the moment
which would benefit from a kind of cleansing of this ‘Yuk!’ vocabulary?

JS: I think issues to do with changing human biology and
human nature and radical advances in biological science are
something that we’re going to have to really go beyond
appealing to our ‘Yuk!’ reactions, because what’s on offer is
enormous. The advances of human biology could provide
fundamental improvements to the human condition and
human nature. But many people have a ‘Yuk!’ response to
changing human nature. They have ideas of us playing God,
of us creating Frankenstein, of us creating human devils. But
what’s really on offer is the ability to unshackle ourselves
from our evolutionary constraints. Evolution was simply
concerned with creating beings that live long enough to
reproduce. Yet we care much more about other aspects of
our lives than simply whether we can reproduce. Our
fundamental cognitive abilities, our physical abilities, even
our capacity to love other people could be influenced by
changes in human biology.

We now understand the patterns of human relationships
and love. We understand there are three phases: lust,
attraction, attachment, each with different hormonal
mechanisms, each of which can be manipulated or influ-
enced in certain ways, strategically and scientifically. Instead
of falling out of love we could maintain love through the use
of biology. In terms of physical enhancements, scientists have
created a mouse that can run 5 kilometres on a treadmill at
20 metres per minute; the normal mouse runs 200 metres,
not 5 kilometres. The mouse lives longer and reproduces
much longer, it’s much healthier. We could make the same
genetic changes in humans. So we’ll have to ask whether we
can simply settle these questions by looking at our intuitions
and our ‘Yuk!’ reactions—I don’t think so. There will be
good reasons against them, but those reasons won’t be
generated by simplistic appeals to our intuitions or to our
‘Yuk!’ reactions.

NW: Is there a danger that if we rid ourselves of the ‘Yuk!’ reaction
that we’ll be vulnerable to certain sorts of systematic biases in reasoning
that we all know exist?

JS: One of the standard objections that you hear is that this
is precisely what the Nazis did, they overcame their ‘Yuk!’
reactions to killing human beings, and look what happened
there. It’s really a bad analogy, because the Nazis couldn’t
appeal to any sort of fundamental values that we all share,
and I don’t think the fact that they were able to overcome
their emotional reactions was the fundamental problem.
What we need are sound ethical principles. You’ve got to
remember the people who kept slaves, who stopped women
voting, believed that they were doing the right thing, had
‘Yuk!’ reactions to blacks marrying whites—and very
profound, very deep, very widespread emotions; they were
certain that their intuitions were correct.

NW: Is there anything that you still find completely repugnant even
though reason says this shouldn’t be absolutely immoral to pursue?

JS: Yes, I have that reaction to having sex with animals. You
could justify it if it were the case that the animal and the
human were both enjoying it and it didn’t cause further harm
to anyone else. I can’t see any very strong reason against it
except that it’s a waste of time: you could do better things
with your time. But I still have quite a strong emotional
reaction to it. It’s not something I’d want to find out that my
children were engaged in. I guess the other one is the
German cannibalism case, where one person wanted to be
eaten and the other one wanted to eat him. I still feel fairly
revolted by that idea, even if we can’t find strong reasons
against it.
