FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE
ON THE GENEALOGY
OF MORALITY

On the Genealogy of Morality, which is one of the most important
of Nietzsche’s works, is the closest in style to a conventional philo -
sophical treatise, at least at first glance. In other books, such as Thus
Spake Zarathustra, Nietzsche resorted to aphorisms: short, pithy
remarks which force the reader to pause and reflect, and which demand
a special kind of reading. On the Genealogy of Morality, in contrast,
consists of three essays, each on a related theme. The central theme
is the origins of morality: the literal translation of the book’s title
is On the Genealogy of Morality, though it has sometimes been
translated as On the Genealogy of Morals. The implicit argument is
that the moral concepts we have inherited from a Christian tradition
are now obsolete and inferior to their pagan predecessors. Nietzsche
had declared the death of God in his earlier book, The Gay Science:
‘God is dead; but given the way of men, there may still be caves for
thousands of years in which his shadow will be shown’ (Gay Science,
section 108). On the Genealogy of Morality is in part a working out
of the implications of the absence of any God and the consequences
for morality. We have inherited outmoded moral concepts based on
Christianity’s false beliefs. Laying bare the origins of these concepts
in bitter resentful emotions, Nietzsche seems to believe, will allow
us to see them for the soul-cramping injunctions that they are, and
free us to replace them with a more life-enhancing approach. This,
it must be stressed, is implicit rather than explicit in the text: most
of the book is devoted to an analysis of the origins, both psychological
and historical, of several key moral concepts.

But Nietzsche’s aim is not simply to replace one morality with
another; he wants to call into question the value of morality itself.
If moral goodness is little more than the product of envious and
resentful emotions, and the response of particular groups to their
circumstances rather than some unchanging part of the natural world,
what ultimate value does it have? It is not clear that Nietzsche provides
an answer to this question, but this is his aim. His basic methodology
is genealogical. But what does this mean?

GENEALOGY
Genealogy is literally the activity of tracing your ancestors,
establishing your pedigree. Nietzsche means by it tracing the origins
of particular concepts, largely by examining the history of the
changing meanings of words. His training in philology (the study of
languages and the origins of words) equipped him to trace the
changing meanings of the words he investigates. His application of
the genealogical method in On the Genealogy of Morality is intended
to show that received opinion about the source of morality is mis -
leading, and that, historically, concepts such as moral goodness, guilt,
pity and self-sacrifice originated in bitter emotions turned against
others, or against oneself.

Genealogy, however, is meant to provide not just a history of these
concepts, but also a critique of them. By uncovering their true origins,
Nietzsche intends to reveal their dubious pedigrees and thereby
question their exalted place in the morality of his day. The fact that
moral concepts have a history undermines the view that they are
absolute and apply to all people at all times. This approach to moral
philosophy is, like most of Nietzsche’s thought, highly controversial,
both as a methodology and in terms of its alleged findings.

FIRST ESSAY: ‘GOOD AND EVIL’ AND
‘GOOD AND BAD’
In the first of the three essays that constitute the book, Nietzsche
puts forward his theory about the origins of our basic moral
terminology of approval and disapproval: the words ‘good’ and ‘evil’
when used in a moral context. He develops his ideas by criticising
the views of English psychologists who claimed that ‘good’ was origin-
ally applied to unselfish actions not so much because the actions
themselves were good, but because they were useful to those who
benefited from them, those to whom goodness was shown. Gradually
people forgot the term’s origins and came to think of unselfish actions
as good in themselves rather than because of their effects.

Nietzsche attacks this account, which, like his own, provides a
genealogy of a moral concept. He maintains that the term ‘good’ was
first used by the nobility, who applied it to themselves in order to
set themselves apart from the common people. They had a sense of
their own self-worth; anyone who could not live up to their noble
ideals was obviously inferior and so ‘bad’. In this essay, Nietzsche’s
use of the good/bad distinction (as opposed to the good/evil one) is
always from the point of view of the nobility: the actions of nobles
are good; those of the common people, in contrast, bad.

His account of how the word ‘good’ came to stand for what is
unselfish is in terms of ressentiment. Nietzsche uses the French word
for resentment to refer to the psychological origins of modern uses
of the terms ‘good’ and ‘evil’. Notice that when Nietzsche refers to
the contrast between good and evil (as opposed to good and bad), he
is seeing things from the perspective of the common people rather
than the nobility: he is referring to the modern use of ‘good’ as
unselfish and ‘bad’ as selfish action.

RESSENTIMENT
Ressentiment is the emotion felt by the oppressed. Ressentiment as
Nietzsche uses it is not synonymous with ‘resentment’; rather it is
a specific kind of resentment. It is the imaginary revenge wreaked
by those who are powerless to react to oppression with direct action.
From hatred and a desire for vengeance felt by those who were kept
in check by the nobility came the loftiest values of compassion and
altruism, according to Nietzsche. This is intended both as a historical
description of what actually happened and as an insight into the
psychology of those who brought it about. The common people, who
could not aspire to the lifestyle of the nobility, in their frus tration
overturned the good/bad value-system. In place of the nobility’s
perspective on morality, the common people put their own, which
subverted the status quo. The morality of the common people declared
the nobility’s approach to life, based on power and the ethos of
warriors, to be evil; the wretched, the poor and the lowly were the
good.

Nietzsche attributes this ‘radical revaluation of their enemies’
values’ to the Jews and the subsequent Christian tradition, and calls
it the first slave revolt in morality. We have, without realising it,
inherited the consequences of this revolt, a revolt that served the
interests of the oppressed. For Nietzsche morality is not something
fixed for all time to be discovered in the world; rather it is a human
creation, and as a consequence moral terms have a history, a history
which is influenced by human psychology as well as by the interests
of particular groups. In Nietzsche’s metaphor, the lambs decided that
birds of prey were evil, and so they thought to themselves that the
opposite of a bird of prey, a lamb, must be good. His comment on
this is that it is absurd to deny those who are powerful the natural
expression of their power. His choice of language through out the book
makes it clear that his sympathies lie with the birds of prey rather
than with the lambs.

SECOND ESSAY: CONSCIENCE
The main theme of the second essay is the evolution of conscience,
and specifically of bad conscience. Bad conscience is the sense of guilt
with which modern humanity is burdened yet which is necessary for
life in society.

The essence of Nietzsche’s argument is that the psychological
source of the sense of guilt is frustrated instinct. Human beings
instinctively get pleasure from their powerful actions, and particularly
from inflicting suffering. But when, through socialisation, a block is
put on acting on our desires to inflict cruelty on others, the expression
of the desire is thwarted and turned inwards. We torture ourselves
inwardly with guilty feelings because society would punish us if
we tried to torture other people. This is a particular instance
of Nietzsche’s general principle that all instincts not discharged
outwards turn inwards, a principle which Sigmund Freud would later
elaborate.

In the course of his discussion of the origin of conscience,
Nietzsche points out that punishment was originally independent of
any notion of responsibility for one’s actions: you would be punished
simply for breaking an agreement whether or not it was your fault.
The original meaning of the German word for guilt was ‘debt’. The
guilty were those who had failed to repay their debts. Yet ‘guilt’
has become a moral concept. The hidden history of the concept
which Nietzsche unveils is supposed to reveal the contingency of the
modern use: it could have been otherwise and is not a natural ‘given’.
The unstated implication of this and the earlier discussion of the
origins of ‘good’ seems to be that the meanings of key moral concepts
are not fixed for all time but can be transformed by an immense
creative act of will.

THIRD ESSAY: ASCETICISM
The third essay is less focused than the first two and meanders from
topic to topic. Nevertheless, the central theme is reasonably clear.
Nietzsche addresses the question of how asceticism, the philosophy
of life which encourages abstinence and self-denial, could have
arisen. Ascetics typically advocate chastity, poverty, self-flagellation
(either literal or metaphorical) and so on; they deliberately turn away
from the pleasures and fulfilments that life offers. Nietzsche ident-
ifies ascetic impulses in artists, philosophers and priests. Indeed, he
suggests that viewed from a distant star, earth would be seen to
be teeming with creatures riddled with self-loathing and disgust,
their only pleasure being to inflict as much harm on themselves as
they possibly can: not on each other, but on themselves. How could
such a widespread trend have evolved? How could life have so turned
against itself?

Nietzsche’s answer is, once more, in terms of genealogy. Self-denial
was the last resort of the almost powerless. Frustrated in their attempts
to exert influence on the world, rather than ceasing to will anything
at all, they directed their power against themselves. One of Nietzsche’s
characteristic psychological insights is the joy that human beings
take in inflicting cruelty. This cruelty is not just directed at others:
we even take delight in inflicting it upon ourselves. The ascetic
impulse, which for Nietzsche is an apparently absurd drive to self-
destruction, is a kind of self-torture which was the last resort of those
who cannot exert their will in the world, yet it has become an ideal
to be celebrated.

CRITICISMS OF ON THE GENEALOGY
OF MORALITY

The genetic fallacy
A fundamental criticism of Nietzsche’s methodology in On the
Genealogy of Morality is that it commits the genetic fallacy. The
genetic fallacy is the unreliable method of reasoning from what
something at one stage was to what it now is. For instance, from the
fact that the word ‘nice’ originally meant ‘fine’, in the sense of fine
distinctions, it in no way follows that this will reveal anything im -
portant about present uses of the term. Or, to take another example,
from the fact that oak trees come from acorns we cannot conclude
that oak trees are small greenish brown nuts, or that they have much
in common with them at all. Some of Nietzsche’s critics have argued
that the genealogical method always commits this fallacy, and so sheds
little or no light on current uses of moral terms.

However, in On the Genealogy of Morality, although in places
Nietzsche does seem to be suggesting that because certain moral
concepts originated in bitter emotions their ultimate value is
undermined (and so here might be accused of committing the genetic
fallacy), for the most part his method is intended to reveal that moral
concepts are not absolute and that revaluations of value have taken
place in the past, and so might do so again. The genealogical method
is particularly good at revealing that concepts which we have taken
to be fixed for all time can be changed. This use of the method does
not involve the genetic fallacy. In order to cast doubt on the absolute
nature of moral uses of the word ‘good’, for instance, it is sufficient
simply to show that it has been applied very differently in the
past. There is no need to suggest that because it was used differently
in the past this past meaning of the word must somehow affect
present uses.

Lack of evidence
A more serious criticism of Nietzsche’s approach in On the Genealogy
of Morality is that in each of the three essays he provides scant
evidence for his hypotheses. Even if we accept that ‘good’ might
have been used differently in the past, or that conscience and
asceticism evolved from thwarted desires, Nietzsche’s evidence for
the specific accounts of these genealogies is extremely thin. Although
psychologically astute, his discussions are, as historical accounts,
virtually unsupported. Without the historical evidence to back up his
assertions about the origins of moral concepts, we have no reason to
believe that his accounts reflect what actually happened. The best that
could be said in Nietzsche’s defence on this point is that if he has
provided reasonably plausible accounts of what might have happened,
then he has succeeded in raising doubts about the allegedly fixed
and unchanging moral concepts that we have inherited. Perhaps the
import ant point is to understand that moral concepts can change
their meaning, that they are human creations, rather than part
of the natural world waiting to be discovered.

Evil uses of his ideas
Perhaps the most frequent criticism of Nietzsche’s philosophy as a
whole is that it has been cited approvingly by anti-semites and
fascists. For instance, some Nazis felt that his ideas were in tune with
theirs. Some comments in On the Genealogy of Morality if taken in
isolation could be thought anti-semitic: though he shows a grudging
admiration of the Jews’ transvaluation of values, he stresses that it
was the last resort of the weak. He cannot disguise his own sympathy
for the noble morality of the powerful. Throughout his philosophy,
he repeatedly celebrates power even at the expense of the weak.

However, there are two important points to consider in relation
to the criticism that his ideas have been used for evil ends. First, many
of those who have used Nietzsche’s philosophy in this way have
had to distort it to achieve this. For instance, although isolated sen-
tences of Nietzsche’s writing might be taken to be anti-semitic, these
have to be balanced by other passages which are explicitly opposed
to anti-semitism. The second point is that the fact that his ideas appear
to glorify power does not thereby prove them wrong. One of the
reasons why reading Nietzsche’s work can be so challenging is that
he is constantly gnawing at our most cherished beliefs. Even if he
hasn’t succeeded in undermining these beliefs, his writings force
us to reflect on the foundations and assumptions on which all our
lives are built.
