JEAN-JACQUES
ROUSSEAU THE SOCIAL
CONTRACT

‘Man was born free, and everywhere he is in chains.’ This, the opening
line of The Social Contract, has stirred the heart of many a
revolutionary over the past two hundred years. Yet it is balanced in
the same book by the disconcerting thought that those who fail to
act for the general good of the state should be ‘forced to be free’.
This sounds like a licence for oppression given the difficulty of working
out what is genuinely for the good of the state. Both these ideas
convey the uncompromising nature of Rousseau’s philosophy: he
was never afraid to express controversial and even dangerous
thoughts. In an age when the convention was to publish such views
anonymously, Rousseau wrote under his own name. As a result
many of his works were banned and he lived in constant fear of
persecution, several times having to flee his home for safety. In the
circumstances it is not surprising he became paranoid, ending up
believing that he was the victim of an international conspiracy.

Rousseau’s central aim in The Social Contract is to explain the
sources and limits of legitimate authority. He believes that our
duties towards the state stem from a social contract, or ‘social pact’,
by means of which groups of individuals are transformed into a
body politic: a whole which has its own general will which isn’t
necessarily just a sum of the individual wills of the people of which
it is composed.

SOCIAL CONTRACT
Like most writers in the social contract tradition, including Hobbes
and Locke, Rousseau describes the social contract as if it were a
historical event. However, this isn’t meant as a claim about how
actual states must have been created; rather it is a device to bring out
the underlying structure of the state. He is not saying that there was
a moment in history when people actually got together and made a
deal with each other, but only that the relations between citizens and
the state can best be understood by considering the hypothetical
origins of the association.

The basic agreement made by members of a state is that they shall
unite for their common good. There is a great deal to be gained by
co-operating as part of a society rather than living alone. Society can
provide protection of life and property. So individuals have a very
strong incentive to collaborate and form a state.

At first glance it might seem that Rousseau entertains two
incompatible ideals since he both praises the freedom that all humans
have, even outside society, and at the same time emphasises the great
benefits of life within society. Our natural freedom is a necessary
part of our humanity: if we give up our freedom entirely, or become
slaves, then we cease to be fully human. If society were to take away
our freedom entirely then there would be no point in joining it, since
in the process we would lose our humanity. Rousseau sets himself
the task of explaining how we can form a state without sacrificing
our freedom. This may seem impossible since the essence of life in
society is that you give up most of your natural freedoms in order
to reap the benefits of protection. However, Rousseau believes that
his particular version of social contract theory does provide a formula
that combines genuine freedom with the fruits of society. Central to
his account is his doctrine of the general will.

THE GENERAL WILL
Once individuals have transformed themselves into a state by means
of a social contract, they are united by common goals. The general
will is the wish of the state as a whole: the general will aims at the
common good.

The concept of the general will is probably easier to understand
when it is compared with that of the will of all. It may be that all
the individuals who together make up the state desire a certain
outcome because they stand to gain individually by it: for instance,
they might all desire a reduction in taxation. Thus the will of all the
individuals is to lower taxes. However, if the whole state stands to
gain by keeping taxes high, then that is the general will, even though
the individuals with their combined personal interests do not wish
to pursue this policy. For the common good, taxes should be kept
high and anyone who resists this should be ‘forced to be free’.
Similarly, I might as an individual have a vested interest in a new
road not being built through my back garden. However, if the new
route turns out to be the best one for the common good, then as part
of the state I must at some level will this.

Rousseau’s philosophy draws a sharp distinction between
individuals with their personal interests and desires, which are largely
self-serving, and those same individuals as parts of the state. In the
latter public role, there is no scope for dissent from the general
will: that would be like turning against your own better self. The
self-interested desires that you have as an individual should always
be subservient to the higher aims of the general will. The general
will is for the common good, and the continued existence of the state
depends upon its members setting aside their private interests where
they conflict with the state’s interests.

FREEDOM
This might seem to leave little room for freedom, at least as the term
is generally understood. If you have to sacrifice your personal desires
for the greater good of the state, then it seems that your freedom to
act will often be limited. We have already seen that Rousseau is happy
to advocate forcing people to be free when they refuse to acknowledge
the general will. However, Rousseau maintains that far from
diminishing freedom, this organisation of the state provides it. Acting
in accordance with the general will is the most important form of
freedom. It is civil freedom, as opposed to the mere desire-satisfaction
permissible outside society. For him there is nothing paradoxical
about achieving such freedom by means of force.

THE LEGISLATOR
The success and longevity of a state depend on the nature of its
constitution. Good and appropriate laws are essential for its continued
survival. Rousseau suggests that these laws should be created by a
legislator. The good legislator is a remarkable individual who brings
about a transformation of the people by making a flourishing state
possible. Rousseau argues that the legislator’s only function should
be to write the laws of the state. A legislator who was also a sovereign
might be tempted to skew the laws in the direction of his own interests,
knowing that he would have the power to gain by this. Nor should
the legislator draw up an ideal set of laws without taking into account
the nature of the people and land for whom he is working. Laws have
to be tailored to circumstances.

GOVERNMENT
Government should be clearly distinguished from the sovereign.
Government’s role is purely executive. This means that the govern-
ment is the group of individuals who put into action the general
policies that have been provided by the sovereign. The sovereign is
the name Rousseau gives to the state when it is actively pursuing
the general will. In less than perfect states the sovereign may take
another form, but in Rousseau’s ideal state it is composed of every
citizen. His use of the word ‘sovereign’ can be quite confusing because
for us it can simply mean ‘monarch’. But Rousseau was thoroughly
opposed to the idea that sovereign power should rest with a monarch.
One reason why The Social Contract was considered to be subversive
was its defence of rule by the people and its open attacks on the idea
of a hereditary monarchy.

THREE TYPES OF GOVERNMENT
Rousseau considers three possible types of government, though he
recognises that most actual states employ a mixture of types. The
three basic types are democracy, aristocracy and monarchy. Unlike
many political theorists, Rousseau does not prescribe one form of
government for every state: a certain flexibility is appropriate, taking
into account the circumstances, the size of the state, the nature and
customs of the people, and so on. However, he does rank the types
of government and clearly prefers an elective aristocracy over
the rest.

Democracy
Although the governments of the United Kingdom and the United
States are often described as ‘democratic’, for Rousseau they would
more likely be counted as elective aristocracies. By ‘demo cracy’ he
meant direct democracy, that is, the system by which every citizen
is entitled to vote on every issue. Clearly such a system could only
work in a very small state and with relatively simple business to
decide, otherwise the logistics of getting the whole citizenship
together and getting through the business of government would
overwhelm all other activity. Rousseau recognises the attractiveness
of such direct democracy when the practical difficulties can be
overcome, but points out that ‘so perfect a government’ is better suited
to gods than mortals.

Aristocracy
Rousseau recognises three types of aristocracy: natural, elective and
hereditary, though we usually only use the word to describe the last
of these. He thinks hereditary aristocracy the worst kind of aristocracy,
and elective the best. Elective aristocracy is government by a group
of individuals who have been elected on grounds of their suitability
for the job. Elections minimise the risk of those who put private
interests before the common good exercising their power for long.

Monarchy
Monarchy puts the power of government into the hands of an
individual. This system has many inherent dangers. For instance,
Rousseau maintains that monarchs tend not to appoint competent
officers, but select on the basis of making a good impression at
court rather than aptitude for the job. The result is bad government.
He is particularly scathing about hereditary monarchies, which,
he says, always run the risk of handing over supreme power to
children, monsters or imbeciles, a view that would not have been
sympathetically heard by those who believed in the divine right of
kings, the idea that an inherited monarchy was God’s will.

CRITICISMS OF THE SOCIAL CONTRACT

Freedom
One common criticism of Rousseau’s The Social Contract is that it
seems to legitimise oppression of an extreme kind; that far from
providing the conditions for freedom, it gives totalitarian govern-
ments a justification for removing them. This view is lent support
not just by the sinister implications of the phrase ‘forced to be free’
but also by Rousseau’s suggestion that the state should employ
a censor whose responsibility it is to enforce morality. The civil
freedom that Rousseau celebrates may turn out to be extreme
oppression; it certainly needn’t include the toleration that the word
‘freedom’ promises. Whether this is or is not so will depend on the
nature of the general will.

This is not to say that Rousseau was deliberately promoting a
framework for oppression. His sincere aim was to describe a situation
which would provide both freedom and the benefits of society. It is,
however, a weakness of his system that it could support oppression.

How do we discover the general will?
Even if we concede that we should sacrifice our individual interests
for the sake of the general will, there still remains the problem of
discovering what that general will is. Rousseau suggests that if the
people were to vote on any issue without consulting each other,
then the majority vote would be in the direction of the general will,
minor differences of interest, as it were, cancelling each other out.
This, however, seems implausible: it would at the very least require
a fully informed populace. Besides, to expect the people to vote
without forming factions is unrealistic. So we are left with the practical
problem of deciding what is for the common good. Without the
possibility of discovering the common good, Rousseau’s entire theory
would crumble.

GLOSSARY
aristocracy: an elite group of rulers who may owe their position to
  nature, election, or else heredity.
democracy: for Rousseau this usually means the direct participation
  of all citizens in any major decision.
executive: those responsible for putting state policies into action.
general will: whatever is in the common good. Not to be confused
  with the will of all.
legislator: the exceptional individual entrusted to write the state’s
  constitution.
monarchy: a state which entrusts its fate to a monarch, usually selected
  on the basis of heredity. Rousseau strongly opposed monarchy.
social contract: the agreement of individuals to come together to form
  a state held together by their common interests.
sovereign: not to be confused with a monarch. For Rousseau the
  sovereign is, ideally, the state pursuing the general will.
will of all: the sum of what particular citizens happen to desire. This
  need not coincide with the general will: the will of all may not be
  in the general interest as individuals often choose selfishly.
