A. J. AYER LANGUAGE,
TRUTH AND LOGIC

Most people talk and write nonsense some of the time; and some
people talk and write nonsense all of the time. But it can be difficult
to detect precisely who is talking and writing nonsense when. In
Language, Truth and Logic Ayer presents what he believes to be an
infallible nonsense detector, a two-pronged test for meaningful-
ness which he calls the Verification Principle. With this test he
demonstrates that a huge swathe of philosophical writing doesn’t
deserve to be called philosophy at all, since it is simply nonsensical.
He suggests that we set it aside and get on with the real business of
philosophy, which is to clarify the meaning of concepts. The subject
that is left after he has wielded his Verification Principle is very much
slimmer than philosophy as traditionally conceived: there is no place
for metaphysics, for example.

Language, Truth and Logic, which Ayer published before his 26th
birthday, is, then, an iconoclastic book, one which attempts to
transform the nature of philosophy and of philosophising. The book
is not itself wholly original, since most of its ideas are to be found
either in the work of David Hume, or else in that of the so-called
Vienna Circle, a group of intellectuals who met regularly in the late
1920s to discuss philosophy and who founded the school of thought
known as logical positivism. Nevertheless, Ayer’s was the first, and
best-known, synthesis of these ideas to appear in English.

THE VERIFICATION PRINCIPLE
It is tempting to think that all statements are either true or false.
However, there is a third important class of statements, namely those
which are neither true nor false, but literally meaningless. Ayer’s
Verification Principle is designed to pick out this third class of
statements. So, for example, it is true that I am typing this on a word
processor; false that I am writing it by hand; and meaningless to say
‘colourless green ideas sleep furiously’. This last statement is the
equivalent of saying ‘blah’: although it uses words, it can be neither
true nor false since it is impossible to come up with any criterion for
determining whether it is true or false.

The Verification Principle asks two questions of any statement.
First, ‘Is it true by definition?’ And second, if not, ‘Is it in principle
verifiable?’ Any statement which passes the test, that is, is either true
by definition or else in principle verifiable, is meaningful. Any
statement which fails the test is meaningless, and so should not be
taken seriously.

Actually, Ayer usually does not talk of statements, but rather of
propositions. Propositions are the underlying logical structures
of statements: the point is that ‘The cat sat on the mat’ expresses
a proposition which could equally well be expressed in another
language. It doesn’t affect the truth of the statement if it is in French
or Swahili. So statements made in different languages can express
the same proposition. Also, Ayer usually talks of ‘putative’
propositions: here the word ‘putative’ is used so as to leave open the
possibility that they might not be propositions at all (i.e. that they
might be nonsensical): ‘putative’ just means ‘supposed’.

Let’s consider the first prong of the Verification Principle, the
question ‘Is it true by definition?’ An example of a proposition that
is true by definition is ‘All bachelors are unmarried men.’ There is
no need to conduct a survey to establish that this statement is true:
anyone who purports to be a bachelor and yet is married has simply
misunderstood the meaning of the word ‘bachelor’. The statement
is a tautologous one, that is, one that is logically true. Another
example of a statement that is true by definition is ‘All cats are
animals.’ Again, there would be no need to conduct any research in
order to assess whether or not this statement is true: it is true simply
by virtue of the meanings of the words. This kind of statement is
sometimes also called an analytic truth (‘analytic’ is used here in a
technical sense).

In contrast, statements such as ‘Most bachelors are untidy’ or ‘No
cat has ever lived longer than thirty years’ are empirical statements.
Some kind of observation is needed in order to assess whether or not
they are true. You can’t tell conclusively whether or not they are
true unless you do some research into the matter. These statements
purport to be factual ones. They are not just about the meaning of
words, but report on features of the world referred to by the words.
They are the sort of statement covered by the second prong of the
Verification Principle.

Ayer asks of empirical statements such as those given in the
previous paragraph ‘Are they in principle verifiable?’ Here ‘verifiable’
simply means capable of being shown to be true or false. The word
‘verifiable’ is slightly confusing since in ordinary language to verify
something is to show that it is true; however, Ayer allows that
showing something to be false is also a case of verifying it. He includes
the words ‘in principle’ in the question because there are very many
meaningful statements that cannot practically be tested. For instance,
prior to space travel, a scientist could have claimed that the moon
was made of limestone. This might have been practically difficult to
refute; nevertheless, in principle it is easy to see how it could be
refuted: get a specimen of moon rock and see if it is limestone. So it
is a meaningful statement, despite the fact that at the time of being
uttered it was not possible to test it. Similarly, even so absurd a
statement as ‘The moon is made of cream cheese’ is meaningful since
it is obvious how it can be shown to be false. Again it is im portant
to recognise that Ayer is using the word ‘meaningful’ in a specialised
sense, since in ordinary language we rarely call statements which we
know to be false ‘meaningful’. Statements about what happened in
the past can be particularly difficult to verify in practice; specifying
that these need only be verifiable in principle gets around the problems
that would otherwise arise in assessing the status of such statements.

What emerges from this is that, when considering any putative
proposition, for Ayer there are just three possibilities: that it is
meaningful and true; that it is meaningful yet false; and that it is
completely meaningless. The last category, that of completely
meaningless utterances, is his main target in Language, Truth and
Logic.

According to Ayer many philosophers have been duped into
believing that they were making meaningful statements when in fact,
as application of his Verification Principle reveals, they have been
writing nonsense. His favourite word for such nonsense in the realm
of philosophy is ‘metaphysics’. A metaphysical sentence is one which
purports to say something genuine (i.e. meaningful) but, because it
is neither true by definition nor empirically verifiable, is actually
meaningless.

STRONG AND WEAK SENSES OF
‘VERIFIABILITY’
One problem that would arise for Ayer if he demanded that
meaningful statements that weren’t true by definition had to be
conclusively verified is that general empirical claims are not subject
to conclusive proof. For instance, take the general statement ‘All
women are mortal.’ However many cases of mortal women you
observe, you will never prove once and for all that this statement is
true, only that it is very probably true. This is good enough for
practical purposes. But if Ayer had adopted what he calls the strong
sense of verifiability, that is demanded conclusive empirical proof for
any empirical generalisation to be meaningful, he would have set too
high a standard.

Instead he adopts a weak sense of ‘verifiability’. For an empirical
statement to be meaningful there need only be some observations
which would be relevant to determining whether it was true or false.
These observations need not make it certain that it is true or that it
is false.

Some critics of Ayer’s work have pointed out that the distinction
between strong and weak senses of verification is itself a meaning-
less one since no empirical statement could ever in practice or in
principle meet the rigorous demands of the strong principle. Ayer,
however, in the introduction to the second edition of the book,
suggests that there are what he calls ‘basic propositions’ which can
be conclusively verified. These are the kind of proposition expressed
by statements such as ‘I am in pain now’ or ‘this lemon tastes bitter
to me’. These are incorrigible, meaning that you cannot be mistaken
about them.

METAPHYSICS AND POETRY
One line of defence for metaphysics is to claim that although literally
meaningless it can have the same sort of effect as poetry and thus
be a worthwhile activity in its own right. Ayer is scathing about
this attempt at a justification of metaphysics. First, he points out, this
attempted justification is based on a misapprehension about poetry.
Poetry is rarely meaningless, though it sometimes expresses false
propositions. And even when it is meaningless, the words have been
chosen because of their rhythm or sound. Metaphysics is intended
to be meaningful and true. Metaphysicians don’t attempt to write
nonsense. It is just an unfortunate fact that this is what they do. No
defence in terms of its poetic qualities will mask this fact.

Ayer’s main aim throughout Language, Truth and Logic is to
eliminate metaphysics. He focuses on language, because he believes
that language frequently misleads us into believing that we are making
sense when we are not. This concentration on language is a distinctive
feature of a great deal of philosophy which was written in Britain
and the United States in the first half of this century, and is sometimes
referred to as the linguistic turn in philosophy.

Here we’ll examine the consequences of Ayer’s radical approach
to meaning. But first, what does Ayer understand by ‘philosophy’?

PHILOSOPHY
For Ayer philosophy has a very narrow role. Philosophy is not an
empirical subject: this is what distinguishes it from the sciences.
Whereas the sciences involve statements about the nature of the
world, and thus contribute factual knowledge, philosophy’s role is
one of clarification of the implications of definitions of concepts, and
particularly of the concepts used by scientists. Philosophy is focused
on language rather than on the world described by language. It is
essentially a branch of logic. In fact the activities that Ayer is engaged
in within Language, Truth and Logic, namely the clarification of our
concept of ‘meaningfulness’ and following through its implications,
are paradigm instances of philosophical activity.

THE PROBLEM OF INDUCTION
Ayer’s treatment of the problem of induction provides a good
example of his approach to traditional philosophical disputes. The
problem of induction as it is usually understood is the difficulty of
coming up with a satisfactory justification for our belief that empirical
generalisations based on past observations will hold good for the
future. How can we be sure that the future will be like the past? The
sun rose yesterday, and every day that anyone ever observed before
that, but this does not prove conclusively that it will rise tomorrow.
Yet we all of us confidently rely on inductive generalisations of this
kind, and they are the basis of all science.

Since David Hume first formulated the problem in the eighteenth
century, philosophers have been attempting to justify the use of
inductive reasoning. Ayer’s approach is very different. He attempts
simply to dissolve the problem. He dismisses it as a pseudo-problem,
not a genuine problem. He does so on the grounds that there could
not possibly be a meaningful answer to the question. Since every
genuine question can in principle be answered meaningfully, and this
one cannot, we should set it aside.

His reasoning is as follows. There are only two possible types of
meaningful justification of induction, and both are non-starters. The
first would be to give a justification based on truth by definition,
perhaps on the definition of ‘induction’, or of ‘true’. However, this
is a non-starter because to attempt such a justification would be to
make the fundamental mistake of assuming that any factual con -
clusions can be derived from statements about definition. Statements
about definition simply inform us about the use of words or other
symbols.

The second type of justification would be an empirically verifiable
one. For instance, someone might argue that induction is a reliable
method of reasoning since it has worked well for us in the past. But
this, as Hume saw, would be to use induction to justify induction.
Clearly this cannot be acceptable either, since it begs the question; it
assumes that induction is reliable when this is the very point at issue.
So, Ayer concludes, no meaningful solution is possible. The problem
of induction so-called is not, then, a genuine problem.

MATHEMATICS
It is clear that the propositions expressed in mathematics must, on
the whole, be meaningful ones. If they did not come out as meaningful
on Ayer’s analysis we would have very good grounds for dismissing
his theory. How, then, can he show that they are meaningful? He
has only two choices: they must be either true by definition or else
empirically verifiable (or perhaps a mixture of the two).

Very few philosophers have claimed that 7 + 5 = 12 is simply a
generalisation based on adding together seven things and five things
and getting twelve each time. This is a highly implausible view to
hold. So Ayer is left with the consequence that 7 + 5 = 12 is true by
definition, simply a question of how we use the symbols ‘7’, ‘+’, ‘5’,
‘=’, and ‘12’. But if 7 + 5 = 12 is true by definition in the same way
that ‘All bachelors are unmarried men’ is true by definition, Ayer
needs to explain how we can be surprised by mathematical ‘discoveries’
since, according to this theory, the solution must be implicit in the
phrasing of the problem. Ultimately all equations will be the
equivalent of the obviously tautologous A = A. So how can we have
a sense of making a discovery in mathematics?

Ayer’s answer is that although mathematical statements are true
by definition, some mathematical truths are not obviously true at
first sight. For instance, take the equation 91 × 79 = 7,189. This is far
less obvious than 7 + 5 = 12. Yet it is still true by definition. We need
to use calculation to check that it is true; this calculation is ultimately
nothing more than a tautological transformation. But because we
cannot immediately see that the answer is correct, we find it
interesting, although ultimately it does not give us any new factual
information.

ETHICS
Ayer’s treatment of ethics is one of the most controversial aspects
of Language, Truth and Logic. His basic belief is that judgements
about right and wrong are for the most part simply expressions of
emotion and as literally meaningless as the expressions ‘Boo!’ and
‘Hooray!’ He arrives at this extreme conclusion by application of his
Verification Principle.

Examining ethical philosophy he finds four types of statement.
First, there are definitions of ethical terms; for instance, we might find
in a book of ethics a detailed definition of ‘responsibility’. Second, there
are descriptions of moral phenomena and their causes; for instance, a
description of pangs of conscience and how they might originate in
early moral or religious training. Third, there are what Ayer calls
‘exhortations to moral virtue’. A simple example of this would be
a plea for readers to keep their promises. And last, there are ‘actual
ethical judgements’. These are statements such as ‘Torture is a moral
evil.’

Ayer examines each of these four types of statement. The first
class, of definitions, is the only one which he considers acceptable
as ethical philosophy. This class (the definitions of ethical terms)
consists of statements which are true by definition and so pass his
test for meaningfulness. The second class of statement, descriptions
of moral phenomena, although passing the second prong of the test,
and so meaningful, are not the province of philosophy. They are
empirically verifiable, and so their treatment belongs to a branch of
science, in this case either psychology or sociology. The third class
of statement, exhortations to moral virtue, can be neither true nor
false and are thus literally meaningless. They cannot belong to either
science or philosophy.

The last class, the ethical judgements, Ayer treats at greater
length. These are the statements that are usually thought to
constitute ethical philosophy, and have traditionally been assumed
to be meaningful. Ayer agues that they are neither true by defini-
tion nor empirically verifiable, and so are literally meaningless. If
I say ‘You acted wrongly in breaking into my house’, then I am
saying the equivalent of ‘You broke into my house’ in a particular
tone of voice. The claim that you acted wrongly adds nothing
meaningful to the statement. If I make the generalisation ‘House-
breaking is wrong’, provided that ‘wrong’ is being used in an ethical
rather than a legal sense, then I make a completely meaningless
statement, one which is neither true nor false. It is simply
an expression of an emotional attitude towards house-breaking,
an expression which may also be calculated to arouse a similar
emotional attitude in the listener. If you turn back to me and disagree,
saying ‘There is nothing wrong with house-breaking’, there
is no fact of the matter which will decide between us. You would
simply be expressing an alternative emotional attitude towards house-
breaking.

This account of ethical judgements, known as emotivism, has the
consequence that it is impossible to have a genuine dispute about
whether an action is wrong. What seems like a dispute will always
turn out to be a series of expressions of emotion; and there is no point
of view from which we can judge the truth or falsity of the ethical
positions since the positions are not capable of being either true or
false. They do not express genuine propositions at all.

RELIGION
Ayer’s treatment of the statement ‘God exists’ is at least as challenging
as his dismissal of most of ethical philosophy. He claims that the
statement is neither true by definition nor empirically verifiable even
in principle. It can’t be true by definition, since definitions only
indicate word use, and so cannot show the existence of anything. Ayer
rejects out of hand the idea that there could be an empirical proof of
God’s existence. Consequently, he declares, ‘God exists’ is literally
meaningless and can be neither true nor false.

This view does not have a name, but it differs significantly from
the traditional approaches to the question of God’s existence. Tradi-
tionally individuals either believe in God’s existence, are atheists
(i.e. believe that God doesn’t exist), or else are agnostics (i.e. claim
there is insufficient evidence to decide the issue either way). However,
Ayer’s position differs from all three of these since they all take the
statement ‘God exists’ to be meaningful and, respectively, true, false
or unproven. ‘God exists’ is, then, a metaphysical statement, one
which Ayer concludes is completely nonsensical and so should not
be addressed by philosophy. Thus, at a stroke, the problem of whether
or not God exists, one which has occupied the greatest philosophers
for thousands of years, has been dismissed as unanswerable, and so
not worth exerting any philosophical energy upon.

CRITICISMS OF LANGUAGE, TRUTH AND LOGIC

Practical difficulties
Even if we were to accept Ayer’s Verification Principle as a way of
discriminating between meaningful and meaningless statements, there
are some quite serious practical difficulties which would have to be
met. How, for example, are we to determine whether or not a
proposition is verifiable in principle? In other words, what does ‘in
principle’ mean in this context? With a bit of imagination someone
might claim that the statement ‘Reality is one’, an example Ayer uses
of a metaphysical statement, is in principle verifiable. Imagine that
the veil of appearances dropped for a split-second, and that we got a
glimpse of the true nature of reality; then we would be able to make
an observation relevant to the assessment of whether or not ‘Reality
is one’ is true or false. Does this mean that ‘Reality is one’ is verifiable
in principle? Ayer does not give us enough in formation about what
‘verifiable in principle’ means in practice to determine in particular
cases whether or not a statement is metaphysical.

A further practical difficulty about applying the Verification
Principle is that of identifying non-obvious tautologies. In his
discussion of mathematics Ayer allows that some statements can be
true by definition even though we cannot immediately appreciate that
this is so. A consequence of this sort of view is that we might easily
overlook the tautologous nature of many seemingly metaphysical
statements.

Treats propositions in isolation from each other
A different sort of objection which can be levelled at Ayer’s general
approach is that it treats propositions as if they could be separated
out from the complex web of meanings in which they are in fact
embedded. This point has been made by the philosopher W. V. O.
Quine (1908–2000).

For example, Ayer seems to suggest that I could determine the
truth or falsehood of the statement ‘Gravity caused the spaceshuttle
to fall back towards earth’ in isolation from other statements. How -
ever, in order to determine whether or not this was a metaphysical
statement I would need to draw on scientific theory and a range
of other assumptions, many of them built into the way we use
language.

Self-refuting
The most serious criticism of Ayer’s book is that the Verification
Principle does not seem to pass its own test for meaningfulness.
Is the principle itself true by definition? Not obviously so. Is it
empirically verifiable? It is hard to see how it could be. So, according
to its own dictates it is itself nonsensical. If this criticism holds, then
the whole of Ayer’s project collapses since it all depends on the truth
of the claim that any meaningful proposition will pass the test.

Ayer’s response to this criticism is that the Verification Principle
is true by definition. Like the mathematical equation 91 × 79 =
7,189, it is not obviously true by definition: that is why it can be
found interesting and is a discovery. However, Ayer does not
demonstrate from what he derived this Verification Principle, nor does
he provide any equivalent of mathematical calculation by which we
can check to see if he came up with the correct answer.

Or perhaps the Verification Principle is simply a proposal, a
recommendation that we ought to use ‘meaningful’ in the way that
the principle indicates. But if this were so, it would by its own stand -
ards be a metaphysical statement equivalent to the expression of an
emotion: exactly the sort of statement that Ayer is so keen to
eliminate from philosophy.

So, on either account, the criticism that his Verification Principle
is self-refuting has a devastating force.
