THOMAS PAINE
RIGHTS OF MAN

Thomas Paine lived dangerously in dangerous times. He played an
active role in both the American Revolution of 1776 and the French
Revolution of 1779, was imprisoned in France for ten months where
he narrowly missed the guillotine through the incompetence of
his jailors, and was widely (and wrongly) believed to be an atheist
because of his attacks on organised religion at a time when publishing
atheistic tracts attracted severe penalties under the law of blasphemous
libel. He was in fact a deist, but was severely critical of the hypocrisies
and absurdities of organised Christianity. His opposition to the idea
of monarchy landed him in trouble in England, the country of his
birth: he could never return there after leaving in middle age. Paine’s
life was, then, never easy. He lived a precarious existence trying
a range of careers that included corset-maker, customs officer, and
bridge designer; but it was as a writer, thinker and self-styled ‘citizen
of the world’ that he excelled. At the height of his fame he was well-
known in England, France and the United States – and had fervent
admirers and detractors in all three countries. Yet, largely because of
his attacks on religion in his later book The Age of Reason, when he
returned from France to the United States he was not welcome. Far
from it. He ended his life in poverty and obscurity in New York.
Only six people attended his funeral. Ten years after his death,
William Cobbett exhumed his bones and brought them back to Britain
where he intended to set up an appropriate monument for Paine. He
was unable to raise the money to do this, and Paine’s bones remained
in a trunk in his attic. After Cobbett’s death they disappeared.

Paine wrote in a direct, witty and polemical style that found
hundreds of thousands of readers in his lifetime. Unlike many
philosophers before or since, he was immersed in the political struggles
of his day, believing that each generation should assume responsi-
bility for the way their nation is run rather than simply accept an
inherited system from previous generations. This was the source of
his radicalism. He believed that it was right to challenge the existing
state of affairs wherever it produced inequality, and his dissatisfaction
with the political world as he found it led him to formulate new ways
for organising society. He wanted to reorganise society on rational
principles. It is easy, then, to see why he was feared as a subversive
revolutionary. His words were capable of inciting revolt. Many of his
more conservative contemporaries were quite content with the way
things were and emphasized the value of adhering to a slowly evolving
tradition, but Paine was driven by a desire to improve life as soon as
possible. He was keen to find better and more reasonable systems
of government and to promote fairer ways of sharing wealth, and he
was brave enough to make his views public even when it was
dangerous to do so. Understandably those born into privilege and
keen to keep the status quo sought to silence him. Many would have
been happy to see him dead.

COMMON SENSE
The first of two volumes of Paine’s most important book Rights of
Man was published in 1791, but it was with his long pamphlet,
Common Sense, that he first achieved fame. It quickly became a
bestseller – more than 150,000 copies were sold in the year following
its publication in 1776. Here he set out his arguments for the American
colonies’ independence from British rule, in the process exploring ideas
about freedom, equality and democracy. He also included some of his
arguments against hereditary monarchy. The pamphlet inspired many
readers to join the cause of independence and turned Paine into a
hero for American would-be revolutionaries while at the same time
making him an enemy of the British government.

In his later Rights of Man, Paine developed and expanded the
themes of Common Sense, introducing arguments about how
welfare could be achieved in a monarch-free society. The immediate
context of the Rights of Man was the French Revolution, but it had
implications far beyond that.

RIGHTS OF MAN

A response to Edmund Burke
The first of two parts of Rights of Man is a direct response to Edmund
Burke’s book Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790), which
opposed almost every aspect of the revolution and attacked its English
admirers. Burke, a London-based Irish politician and philosopher,
who as a young man had written an outstanding book on the nature
of the sublime, had been sympathetic to the American Revolution.
Paine considered him a friend and an ally. So Burke’s vociferous
opposition to the French Revolution and the ideas that inspired it
came as a shock to Paine. It felt like a betrayal and a personal attack.
Paine dismissed Burke’s Reflections as ‘darkness attempting to
illuminate light’, even going so far as to accuse Burke of taking
money to keep an Anglo-French antagonism going by defending a
position he didn’t really believe in. Paine supported the French
‘Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen’, and held out hopes
for an English revolution. So his opponents were right to think him
subversive.

Who decides for whom?
The conservative Burke argued that the French people were bound
by decisions made by their ancestors about how their country should
be ruled, and it wasn’t for them to break promises that had been made
generations before. This included the decision to be governed by
aristocrats and royalty. Paine’s response was that no one should
be able to bind posterity by a promise, no matter how sincere. Each
successive generation must decide for itself how it wants to be ruled.
The dead can’t decide such important questions for the living.
Whatever a nation as a whole chooses today should be enacted. Paine
believed that laws derived their power from the consent of the living,
not the promises of dead predecessors. This was a powerful message
and one capable of stirring to action those who were undoubtedly
oppressed by a wealthy and disproportionately powerful minority.

A critique of monarchy
At the heart of Paine’s response to Burke was his attack on the idea
of a hereditary monarchy having power over the people. In the
eighteenth century, unlike today, European kings, queens, princesses,
princes, and even quite removed members of royal families had
excessive power and were actively involved in determining the fate
of nations and of individual subjects. For Paine, who saw himself as
a citizen of the world and who believed that all human beings are
equal, this was a nonsensical way of organising society. He delighted
in ridiculing the institutions of monarchy. He, for instance, poked
fun at the idea of a hereditary legislator by describing it as absurd
as that of a hereditary mathematician or a hereditary poet laureate.
The attributes needed in a ruler are no more guaranteed by heredity
than is the ability to do mathematics, or write verse. Why would
anyone want a leader who was there simply because he or she
happened to be descended from another leader? Surely it would be
better to put someone in that position who had displayed an aptitude
and capacity for playing that part well, or at least basic competence.
Furthermore, in Paine’s view all monarchies are tyrannies which
treat the people as a kind of property to be passed on to the monarch’s
descendants. In response to Burke’s suggestion that attacks on Louis
XVI, the reigning king of France, had been savage and unjustified
by that king’s actions, Paine countered that Burke completely mis -
under stood the nature of the French Revolution: it was an attack on
monarchy itself, not on any particular monarch. It was, in a sense,
bad luck for Louis XVI that he happened to be in position when public
opinion welled over into action. Paine’s point was that the power
vested in the position was what was evil, even if the post was occupied
by a relatively benevolent individual. Revolution followed from the
rights of human beings (the ‘rights of man’) and in particular from
basic rights to equality and justice.

Natural rights and equality
Paine believed that we are all born equal in our natural rights. These
rights shape and enhance our existence. They exist prior to our
coming together to form a civil society. These are the rights that
we have simply by virtue of being human beings: a right to live, a
right to our own beliefs, a right to express ourselves freely, and so
on. We have to give up some of our freedoms to live in society and
gain its benefits, and government is needed to protect the weak from
exploita tion by the strong, but our natural rights are the source of
almost everything that is good about existence. In the second volume
of Rights of Man Paine made many positive suggestions about how,
practically, governments might guarantee basic welfare for all mem -
bers of society, through old age pensions, marriage allowances,
benefits for the poor, free education, and many other progressive
policies funded by taxation that were far ahead of his day.

CRITICISMS OF RIGHTS OF MAN

Overoptimistic about human nature
Burke’s position in Reflections on the Revolution in France was more
subtle than Paine allowed. He did not share Paine’s optimism about
humanity and was deeply sceptical about appeals to reason as the
basis of social change. Human reason, Burke believed, is limited and
it is dangerous to let individuals shape a society from scratch: far
better to build on the wisdom of successive generations, a wisdom
that is not necessarily conscious, than to attempt to design a new way
of life with all the risks of violence and disruption that accompany
that reorganisation of society. This wisdom is preserved in precedent
and established ways of living. In other words, Burke had arguments
against the sort of wholesale revolution that was going on in France,
and large-scale social reorganisation in general. The descent into
bloodshed and terror that resulted from the French Revolution was
exactly the sort of consequence that Burke predicted and feared. He
preferred a more gentle reform from generation to generation than
the radical overhaul that Paine supported so enthusiastically. Burke’s
conservatism about progress finds many modern day proponents,
against the more idealistic, optimistic and passionate polemic for
change that is embodied in Paine’s writings.

Relies on rhetoric rather than argument
The Rights of Man is unashamedly a polemic and it relies heavily
on rhetoric, and, as in the critique of the monarchy, on humour.
Paine was self-taught in political theory, and his position lacks
the complexity and sophistication of that of philosophers such as
Hobbes and Locke. He ridicules and caricatures Burke, but rarely
engages head-on with Burke’s reasoning – that’s not his style. He
sometimes just asserts rather than argues for his own position. In his
defence, though, Paine is never obscure, always interesting to read,
and discovered a voice that was entirely appropriate for his wide
reader ship. Furthermore, many of his points, such as those against
mon archy, are far more memorable and effective for having been made
through ridicule than they would have been had they been expressed
in a systematic and detailed tome of political philosophy. His genre
was the political tract, not the academic treatise.
