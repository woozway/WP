IMMANUEL KANT
CRITIQUE OF PURE
REASON

Immanuel Kant described his approach as a ‘Copernican Revolution’
in philosophy. Copernicus put forward the theory that the earth
moves round the sun rather than vice versa. Kant’s revolutionary
idea is that the world that we inhabit and perceive depends on qualities
of the perceiver’s mind, rather than simply existing independently
of us.

If you look at the world through rose-tinted spectacles, then
everything will appear pink. Before Kant, many philosophers assumed
that we were, for the most part, passive recipients of informa tion
about the world. Kant, in contrast, argued that as perceivers of the
world we impose certain features on all our experience. It is a condition
of having any experience at all that we experience the world as
including relations of cause and effect, being ordered in time, and
that the objects we perceive are related spatially to each other. Cause
and effect, and time and space, are contributed by the perceiving
subject rather than being out there in the world, existing indepen -
dently of us. These ‘spectacles’ that we wear colour all our experience.
To carry the analogy further, we would not be able to experience
anything at all if we somehow removed the ‘spectacles’.

The Critique of Pure Reason is, as its title suggests, an attack on
the idea that by reason alone we can discover the nature of reality.
Kant’s conclusion is that knowledge requires both sensory experience
and concepts contributed by the perceiver. Either without the other
is useless. In particular, metaphysical speculation about what lies
beyond the realm of appearances is worthless unless it is grounded
in experience. Pure reason will not provide the key to the ultimate
nature of a transcendent reality.

The book is complex and difficult to follow despite its carefully
designed ‘architectonic’ or structure. Part of the difficulty stems
from the intrinsic difficulty of the subject matter, the fact that Kant
is investigating the limits of human knowledge; but much of it is a
direct consequence of his use of technical language and his convoluted
style. Another feature which makes it difficult to read is the inter-
connectedness of the parts; a full understanding of the work would
involve knowing all its parts and how they interrelate. Here there is
only space to sketch some of its major themes.

THE SYNTHETIC A PRIORI
Empiricist philosophers, such as David Hume, distinguished two sorts
of knowledge: relations of ideas and matters of fact. Relations of ideas
gave knowledge that was true by definition, such as that all kangaroos
are animals. We can be sure of the truth of this independently of
having any experience of kangaroos. It simply follows from the
definition of ‘kangaroo’. If someone claims to have discovered a
kangaroo that isn’t an animal, we know in advance of checking their
story that they are confused about the meaning of ‘kangaroo’. Kant
calls statements like ‘all kangaroos are animals’ ‘analytic’.

An example of the other sort of knowledge that Hume recognised
is ‘some bachelors have collections of etchings’. The way to determine
whether or not such a statement is true is to make some sort of
observation. You can’t tell whether or not it is true independently
of such observation. It is a statement about an aspect of the world.
For Hume there are only these two possibilities: statements have to
be either analytic or empirical. If they are neither, they make no
contribution to human knowledge.

Kant, who describes himself as having been roused from his
‘dogmatic slumbers’ by reading Hume’s work, recognises a third type
of knowledge, knowledge of what he calls the synthetic a priori.
‘Synthetic’ is used in contrast with ‘analytic’. If a statement is not
true by definition, then it is synthetic. A priori is a Latin phrase which
Kant uses to refer to any knowledge which is known to be true
independently of experience; it is contrasted with the phrase a
posteriori, which means acquired from experience. For an empiricist
like Hume, the notion of the synthetic a priori would seem strange.
He took it as obvious that if a statement was a priori it must be
analytic. Kant thought otherwise.

It is perhaps easiest to understand what Kant means by looking at
some more examples. Where Hume allowed for only two possibilities,
Kant allowed for three: the analytic a priori, the synthetic a posteriori
and the synthetic a priori. The analytic a priori includes judgements
such as that all kangaroos are animals; it does not give us new
knowledge about the world. The idea of being an animal is, as Kant
puts it, ‘contained’ in the idea of a kangaroo. The synthetic a posteriori,
in contrast, is the realm of empirical judgements such as that all
philosophers wear glasses. This requires observation in order to
verify or falsify it. The synthetic a priori, Kant’s main interest in the
Critique of Pure Reason, consists of judgements which are necessarily
true, and can be known to be true independently of experience, yet
which give us genuine knowledge of aspects of the world. Kant’s
examples of the synthetic a priori include most of mathematics (such
as, for instance, the equation 7 + 5 = 12) and ‘every event must
have a cause’. Kant claimed that ‘every event must have a cause’ and
‘7 + 5 = 12’ are both necessarily true; yet they are informative about
the world, so neither of them is analytic. The aim of the Critique of
Pure Reason is to investigate how such synthetic a priori judgements
are possible. The answer amounts to an explanation of what must be
true if we, or any other conscious beings, are to have any experience
at all.

APPEARANCES AND THE THING-IN-ITSELF
Kant distinguishes between the world we experience (the world of
phenomena), and the underlying reality behind it. The underlying
reality consists of noumena, about which we can say nothing at all
because we have no access to them. We are restricted to knowledge
of phenomena; noumena must for ever remain mysterious to us.
Hence most metaphysical speculation about the ultimate nature of
reality is misguided, since it purports to describe features of the nou-
menal world, and our lot is to dwell entirely in the phenomenal one.

However, we are not simply passive recipients of sensory infor-
mation about the world. Perceiving involves more than receiving
data. What is received has to be recognised and organised. In Kant’s
terminology, intuitions are brought under concepts. Without concepts
experience would be meaningless; as he puts it, ‘Thoughts without
content are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind’. I couldn’t
have knowledge of the word-processor in front of me without the
intuition (the sensory experience of it); but I also need to be able to
recognise and re-recognise it for what it is, and that involves bringing
it under a concept. The faculty of my mind which deals with intuitions
is the sensibility; the one which deals with concepts is the under -
stand ing. It is through the collaboration of the sensibility and the
understanding that knowledge is possible at all.

SPACE/TIME
Space and time are, in Kant’s terminology, forms of intuition. They
are necessary features of our experience rather than qualities found
in the thing-in-itself. They are contributed by the perceiver. In other
words, when I look out of the window at the street and see children
playing, although it seems to me that the space in which the children
are playing is simply a feature of reality, rather than something I
contribute, Kant’s point is that in order to have knowledge of what
is going on I have to organise my perception in terms of space.
I couldn’t have a non-spatial perception. Similarly, the ordering of
events in time is something that I bring to bear on intuitions rather
than an intrinsic quality of what I perceive.

THE CATEGORIES
Kant identifies twelve categories, including those of substance and of
cause and effect. These are what allow us to bring our intuitions under
concepts. They are a priori concepts. They are the contribution of the
perceiver to experience. It is not just a matter of fact that all our
experience, for instance, can be understood in terms of causes and
effects; this is a necessary condition of having experience at all, and
something that we, as perceiving subjects, contribute rather than
simply discover in the world. The categories together with the forms
of intuition (space and time) are the rose-tinted spectacles that we all
must wear if we are to have any experience at all; but they don’t exist
as a feature of the world independent of all subjects of experience.
They are contributed by conscious subjects, not real features of the
thing-in-itself or noumenal world.

THE TRANSCENDENTAL DEDUCTION
One of the most important sections of the Critique of Pure Reason
is, unfortunately, also one of the most obscure and difficult to unravel.
This is the transcendental deduction of the categories. If successful,
this argument demonstrates that scepticism about the external world
(the philosophical doubt about whether anything that we perceive
exists objectively) is self-defeating. What Kant attempts is to prove
that any experience whatsoever must conform to the categories and
that the experience that is thus produced is of an objective world, not
a merely personal subjective creation of each individual. Sceptics
about the external world begin from their own experience and argue
that they can’t prove that it is really experience of an external world
rather than a pure illusion. Kant argues that because they begin
from experience, such sceptics undermine their own approach: the
existence of an objective external world, always perceived in terms
of the categories, is a condition of our having any experience at all.

The transcendental deduction of the categories is an example of
the type of argument that Kant uses throughout the book, namely a
transcendental argument. It is important not to confuse it with the
word ‘transcendent’, which Kant uses to mean what lies beyond
appearance. A transcendental argument is one which moves from
some aspects of our experience to conclusions about what must
necessarily be so if we are to have this sort of experience. In other
words, it brings out what is presupposed by the very fact that we
have the sorts of experiences that we do.

CRITICISM OF THE CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON

Transcendental deduction fails through
incomprehensibility
Despite the attentions of numerous interpreters and reconstructors,
Kant’s transcendental deduction and its conclusion remain hopelessly
obscure. This is unfortunate. If Kant had succeeded in refuting
scepticism about our experience and its sources, and had done this in
a way intelligible to mortals, then this would have been of immense
significance.

Inconsistent about metaphysics
Much of Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason is directed against rationalist
metaphysics, that is, speculation about reality based on the assumption
that you can glean knowledge about a transcendent reality by pure
thought alone. Yet Kant is in places guilty of the very charge he
lays against other metaphysicians. He postulates the existence of
noumena; but that is, as Berkeley had shown, going beyond what
can reasonably be concluded from our experience. In other words, by
supposing that noumena exist behind the veil of appearance, Kant
was unwittingly indulging in the sort of speculative metaphysics
which he elsewhere makes clear that he abhors.

Although this inconsistency might seem a devastating criticism of
Kant’s interconnected system of thought, several recent commentators
have suggested that a great many of Kant’s philosophical insights are
salvageable and can be reconstructed in a consistent and enlightening
form.

a priori: whatever we know independently of experience.
analytic: true by definition.
the categories: very general concepts which (unlike many more
  ordinary concepts) have to be applied to experience. For Kant there
  are twelve such categories including cause and effect, and sub -
  stance.
concepts: classification-rules which allow us to recognise similar
  intuitions and to make sense of our experience.
the forms of intuition: space and time.
intuitions: the raw data of experience.
noumena: things-in-themselves. The inaccessible reality which lies
  behind appearances.
phenomena: the things which we can perceive. The phenomenal
  world is the world as it appears to us. It is contrasted with the
  noumenal world, the world as it really exists behind appearances.
synthetic: not true by definition.
transcendental argument: any argument from what actually exists to
  what therefore must exist.
transcendental deduction: Kant’s argument which is supposed to
  demonstrate the existence of an objective reality independent of
