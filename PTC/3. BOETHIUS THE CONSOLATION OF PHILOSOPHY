BOETHIUS THE
CONSOLATION OF
PHILOSOPHY

As The Consolation of Philosophy opens, Ancius Manlius Severinus
Boethius is in a prison cell be moaning his condition. He wants to die.
He has nothing to hope for. Fortune, who gave him his wealth and
freedom, has now taken both away. Then, as he is giving vent to his
sorrow in the form of a poem, he becomes aware of a woman standing
over him. Her height seems to fluctuate from average size to
immeasurably tall. Her dress is embroidered at the bottom of
the hem with the Greek letter pi; at the top is the letter theta; in
between them is embroidered a ladder. Her dress is torn in places;
she carries some books and a sceptre. This woman is Philosophy
personified. The letter pi stands for practical philosophy (includ-
ing ethics); the letter theta stands for contemplative philo sophy
(metaphysics and science).

Philosophy rebukes Boethius for forsaking her. Through her
dialogue with Boethius she offers him the consolation he is seeking.
Although he has been unjustly condemned to death and has lost
his great wealth, reputation, and the comforts of freedom, she
points out the inner strength that she, Philosophy, can give him.
She diagnoses his despair and provides soothing medicine in the
form of reason. Philosophy in this form is a kind of self-help, a
consolation to the mind. Boethius sometimes refers to Philosophy as
his nurse.

As far as we can tell, The Consolation of Philosophy was written
in around 524, while Boethius was imprisoned in Pavia, awaiting
execution for an alleged act of treason against the Gothic emperor
Theodoric. This was a dramatic fall from eminence: Boethius had
been one of the most respected and honoured members of Theodoric’s
government. Boethius was subsequently tortured and bludgeoned to
death, an ignominious way to die that a citizen of his standing might
have hoped to have avoided.

Although he published other books on a wide range of subjects,
including music, and translated a substantial part of Aristotle’s works
into Latin, it is for The Consolation of Philosophy, his last work, that
he is now remembered. It is a compelling book written in a mixture
of prose, poetry and dialogue. During the medieval and Renaissance
periods it was one of the most widely read books; Chaucer translated
it, as did Elizabeth I. Its philosophical content is not wholly original,
but the manner in which the ideas are communicated makes it an
entertaining as well as a stimulating book to read.

PHILOSOPHY
Philosophy, personified as a woman, as we have seen, comes to visit
Boethius in his prison cell. But what did Boethius mean by Phil-
osophy? He was a Neo-Platonist, that is, his view of philosophy
was deeply influenced by Plato’s. In particular, he followed Plato in
believing that philosophical contemplation takes us away from the
misleading world of appearances to a true experience of reality. He
repeatedly uses the image of the shadowy world of appearances which
is contrasted with the light of truth. This is an allusion to Plato’s
image of the Sun as the symbol of the Form of the Good in the parable
of the cave that Plato uses in The Republic.

Philosophy teaches Boethius – or rather reminds him – that as a
philosopher he should be immune from the effects of good or bad
fortune. The fact that Philosophy jogs Boethius’ memory is probably
meant, again, as an allusion to a doctrine of Plato’s: the view that
knowledge is a kind of recollection.

CHANCE AND HAPPINESS
A true philosopher is impervious to chance. The wheel of Fortune
inevitably turns, and those who are at the top find themselves very
soon at the bottom. That is the nature of Fortune: to be fickle. In fact,
Philosophy tells him, it is when she is adverse that Fortune best serves
humanity. Good fortune dupes us, because it gives us the illusion of
true happiness; but when Fortune takes off her mask and shows us
how treacherous she can be, that is when we learn most. Adversity
teaches us the frailty of the sorts of happiness that wealth, fame and
pleasure can inspire. It teaches us which of our friends are true
friends.

Boethius had indeed been blessed with good fortune: his two sons
were made consuls on the same day as a public demonstration of
gratitude for his contribution to the running of the state. His im-
prisonment, though, takes his happiness away. Philosophy tells him
that he is being foolish: true happiness can’t be found in anything
that is governed by chance such as wealth or fame. It must come from
within. Here Boethius is influenced by aspects of Stoicism, a
philosophy which emphasises the need for equanimity in the face of
external trouble. For a Stoic, happiness comes from inner resources
and is immune to the effects of chance and misfortune.

EVIL AND REWARD
Boethius laments the fact that there doesn’t seem to be justice in the
world. Evil people often flourish, while the good and virtuous suffer.
In response Philosophy claims that it is the virtuous who are truly
rewarded since they have the power to attain the ultimate end, genuine
happiness, through their pursuit of the good. The evil only appear to
flourish: in fact by abandoning their reason they become subhuman
and are more deserving of pity and remedial treatment than of
retributive punishment.

GOD AND FREE WILL
Having reminded Boethius that true happiness, which everyone seeks,
comes from philosophical contemplation, not from fame, fortune or
pleasure, and that, despite appearances, the wicked cannot genuinely
flourish, Philosophy engages him in debate about God and human
free will. Here the book becomes a serious philosophical dialogue in
the style of Plato’s dialogues. Boethius takes on the role of questioner,
and Philosophy explains the nature of God to him, leading him with
the aid of reason away from mere appearances to a world of purity
and light.

Much of the discussion focuses on the question of how humans
could have free will, the capacity for genuine choice over what they
do, and yet at the same time there could be a God who knows in
advance precisely what they will in fact do. Without free will there
cannot be rational action; yet if God can see what we are going
to do, it is not at all clear in what sense we are genuinely free to
exercise choice.

Philosophy’s answer to this conundrum in part turns on the
distinction between predestination and foreknowledge. Those who
believe in predestination argue that God has brought it about that
certain events will inevitably happen in the future; foreknowledge is
simply knowing in advance what will happen. Philosophy argues that
God’s knowing that certain choices will be made does not cause those
things to happen – human beings can still make choices. So divine
foreknowledge is compatible with genuine choice for humans since
knowing what will happen does not predestine it to happen.

And yet it might seem that if God knows in advance what we will
choose, our apparent choice is an illusion, not really free will, but the
fantasy of it. Philosophy’s response to this line of criticism is that
our idea of foreknowledge erroneously, but understandably, rests
on human experience of time. But God is not like us in import ant
respects. In particular God is outside time and lives in an eternal
present. Because God stands outside time, His foreknowledge is
comparable to our knowledge of the present: past, present and
future are all as one to Him. Our perception of what is happening
now doesn’t make what is happening happen. Nor then does God’s
foreknowledge wipe out the possibility of genuine free choice about
what we do. Our mistake is to think of God’s relation to time as like
our own. God is aware of everything that has happened, is happening,
and will happen.

Philosophy ends the book by exhorting Boethius to virtue since
he is living in the sight of a judge who, from a position outside time
sees and knows everything. Thus in The Consolation of Philosophy
Boethius’ intellectual journey retraces the path of the philosopher in
Plato’s Republic. Boethius leaves behind the shadowy world of
appearances – the equivalent of the flickering shadows on the wall
of the cave – and achieves knowledge of the Form of the Good and
ultimately of God.

CRITICISM OF THE CONSOLATION OF
PHILOSOPHY

Rationalisation?
Boethius’ celebration of everything that is insulated from the effects
of chance might be seen as a rationalisation. Given that he was in
prison and facing torture and almost certain execution, with no hope
of retrieving his former wealth and public esteem, is it surprising that
he should celebrate rational activity above all else? Nothing else
significant is left to him. Perhaps his rejection of wealth and fame as
significant elements in a life that goes well, is just the self-serving
argument of a desperate man.

Even if it is true that Boethius saw the overriding value of rational
deliberation because little else was left to him, as this criticism
suggests, it doesn’t follow that he was wrong. The truth of the matter
is independent of his motivation for believing it. An alternative
interpretation is that Boethius was jolted from his complacency by
having everything he had thought valuable to him removed. Only
then could he come to understand (or rather recollect) Philosophy’s
powerful message; only then could he return to the austere vision of
self-sufficient happiness that Philosophy teaches. This interpretation
is supported in the text by Philosophy’s insistence that adversity can
draw people back to the true way of goodness, whereas the external
trappings of success can lure them into believing that they have
achieved true happiness.

So, even if Boethius’ motivation for believing what Philosophy
taught him was suspect, it does not follow that her message is in
error. What would be devastating to Philosophy’s doctrine, however,
would be the discovery that in fact wealth, fame and other worldly
goods are an essential part of happiness. Aristotle, for example,
believed that a certain amount of wealth, and having children of one’s
own, were important ingredients in happiness. If he was right, then
Boethius’ attempt to gain true consolation from philosophy alone was
destined to failure.
