LUDWIG WITTGENSTEIN
PHILOSOPHICAL
INVESTIGATIONS

Ludwig Wittgenstein did not want to spare other people the trouble
of thinking for themselves. Philosophical Investigations was intended
to stimulate his readers to have their own thoughts rather than to
present them with pre-packaged ideas for convenient consump-
tion. This is reflected in the style of writing, which is fragmentary
and oblique, flitting from one topic to the next and back again. The
answers to philosophical questions are not given in a straightforward
way, but rather suggested through particular examples and stories.
Clues are provided, but their implications aren’t usually spelt out;
metaphors abound, but it is up to the reader to unpack them.

Instead of chapters, Wittgenstein uses shorter numbered sections.
The organisation of the book is not all due to Wittgenstein: it was
published in 1953, two years after his death, and is based on a
manuscript he was working on for a number of years.

RELATION TO TRACTATUS LOGICO-
PHILOSOPHICUS
The only book of Wittgenstein’s to be published during his lifetime
was his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, which appeared in 1921. This
austere series of numbered statements managed to combine a poetic
style with a serious treatment of logic and the limits of human
thought. It is most famous for the concluding pronouncement
‘Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must remain silent.’ This
wasn’t a practical adage, but rather a summary of the views about
the limits of thought. Most of what is important in human life lies
outside the realm of what can be said meaningfully; it is inexpressible,
but no less important for that. In many ways Philosophical
Investigations is a critique of the views expressed in the Tractatus,
and Wittgenstein even suggested that the Tractatus should be
published as a preface to Philosophical Investigations to bring out
what was distinctive about his more recent ideas.

THE NATURE OF PHILOSOPHY
In Philosophical Investigations Wittgenstein sees his role as letting
the fly out of the fly-bottle. What he means by this is that philosophers
buzz around trapped by their attempts to make language do
what it cannot do. They are bewitched by language. As he puts it,
‘Philosophical problems arise when language goes on holiday’ (section
38). In other words, philosophical problems arise from using words
in an inappropriate context.

Wittgenstein’s approach is designed to dissolve such problems
by attending to the actual use of language and thus letting the fly
out of the fly-bottle. Hence his philosophical approach is often
characterised as a therapeutic one: philosophy is the illness that needs
to be cured. Philosophy examines ‘bumps that the understanding has
got from running up against the limits of language’ (section 119).
The cure is to look at how language actually functions, not how we
imagine that it must function. But his analysis of actual uses of
language is not an exercise in social anthropology. By mapping out
some of the ways in which language is used Wittgenstein draws
attention to the limits of thought and meaningfulness. A large part
of this enterprise involved eliminating misleading theories about the
nature of language. Another reason for focusing on particular uses
of language was his belief that large-scale theorising is misguided in
that it rests on the false assumption that we can discover the essence
of the thing being investigated.

MEANING AS USE
A significant part of Philosophical Investigations is directed against
what Wittgenstein thinks is a simplistic account of the nature of
language. He takes Saint Augustine’s account of language-learning
by pointing to objects and naming them as representative of this view.
Holders of this Augustinian picture of language believe that words
are names of objects, and that combinations of words have the sole
function of describing reality.

For example, on this view, in order to learn the meaning of the
word ‘apple’ we present a child with an apple and say ‘this is an apple’.
This is called teaching by ostensive definition: pointing to the object
that is named. Wittgenstein does not deny that such ostensive
definition goes on, but draws attention to a number of difficulties with
the view that this is the basis of all language-learning. For example,
such ostensive definition requires a certain amount of stage-setting.
The child might not understand the institution of pointing at an object,
or else might think that you were pointing out the colour or the shape
of the apple. Every case of ostensive definition allows for a variety of
interpretations of what is being picked out. Furthermore, even if the
child understands the particular case of ostensive definition, he or
she might not be able to make the transition from this case to others
like it.

Language is not simply a medium we use to represent the world.
Rather it is more like a tool kit containing a wide range of implements
which we use for different purposes. Or, to borrow another of
Wittgenstein’s metaphors, language is like the levers in the cabin
of a locomotive. Words resemble each other, so we have a tendency
to think that they all do the same sort of thing. However, like the
levers in the locomotive the similarity is superficial: one lever operates
a valve, another the brakes; one has only two positions, ‘off’ and ‘on’;
another can be moved continuously.

If we examine the nature of actual language, we very quickly find
that the Augustinian picture is inaccurate. The meaning of words is
given by their use rather than by what they might refer to. Language
does not have an underlying essence, a common denominator, a
unique function. Rather, if we examine language we find a pattern
of overlapping functions which it serves in different contexts.
Wittgenstein talks of ‘language games’. He doesn’t mean by this
phrase that using language is a matter of being playful, but that there
are many different rule-governed activities within which language
functions. Language is embedded in our forms of life, the social con -
ventions which have grown up around its various uses. The meanings
of words are governed by how we happen to use them; isolated from
a context of use, a form of life, they are meaningless.

FAMILY RESEMBLANCE TERMS
One common way of being bewitched by language is to assume that
if we correctly use a word to refer to a range of cases, every case must
have something in common with the others. We often assume that,
for example, there is an essence of games, so that whenever we use
the word ‘game’ we are alluding to the common feature that the
activity in question shares with other games. Wittgenstein believes
this to be a mistake. It is a mistake to assume that there must be an
essence shared by all games as much as it is a mistake to assume that
all language uses must have something in common.

Wittgenstein’s defence of this view is based on an analogy with
family resemblances. Blood relations often resemble each other. But
that doesn’t mean that every member of the family shares one or
more common features: what usually occurs is that there is a pattern
of overlapping resemblances rather than a single common feature
found throughout. You might resemble your sister with respect to
hair colour and your mother with respect to eye colour. Your sister
and mother may have the same shaped nose. In this simple example
no single feature is shared by all three members of the family, but
this does not prevent there being a visible family resemblance.
Similarly, there is no common essence shared by all the things we
call ‘games’: board games, football, solitaire, throwing a ball against
the wall, and so on. But we can nevertheless use the word ‘game’
meaningfully. Wittgenstein uses the phrase ‘family resemblance’ to
refer to this sort of overlapping and criss-crossing resemblance.

THE PRIVATE LANGUAGE ARGUMENT
By far the most influential part of Philosophical Investigations is the
group of comments and examples known as the Private Language
Argument, although there is still some controversy about precisely
what Wittgenstein meant by them. It is worth bearing in mind that
Wittgenstein didn’t use the phrase ‘Private Language Argument’,
and it is only his commentators who have suggested that a series
of his comments should be interpreted as a cumulative argument.
Neverthe less, it does seem reasonable to group his thoughts together
in this way and to extract an argument from their progression. In
order to begin to understand this argument, we need to get clear what
Wittgenstein was attacking.

Most philosophers since Descartes have assumed that a proper
study of the nature of the mind must begin from a consideration of
the first-person case, that is, from one’s own experience. I can be more
certain that I am in pain, for example, than that you are. I have
privileged access to the contents of my own mind that does not extend
to the contents of yours. It is as if I have special access to a private
cinema in which my thoughts and feelings are displayed; no one else
has any idea of what happens within my private cinema. My
experience is private to me, and yours to you. No one can really know
my pain or my thoughts. I can describe my inner experience to
myself, and no one else is able to judge whether or not my descriptions
are accurate.

Wittgenstein’s Private Language Argument undermines the view
which props up the idea that my thoughts and feelings are
fundamentally inaccessible to anyone else. The idea rests on a belief
in the possibility of a private language. Wittgenstein shows that no
such language is possible. By ‘private language’ he doesn’t mean a
private code, nor does he mean a language spoken by only one person,
as, for instance, a Robinson Crusoe figure might devise to talk to
himself about his life on a desert island. Rather, a private language,
for Wittgenstein, is one that is in principle unshareable because it is
used to refer to an individual’s allegedly private experiences.

Someone who believes in the possibility of such a private language
might argue that it would be possible for me to keep a diary record-
ing my sensations. I have a particular sensation which I decide to call
‘S’. I put an ‘S’ in my diary. The next time I have the same sort
of sensation, I put another ‘S’ in the diary, and so on. Wittgenstein
argues that this account is incoherent. There is ‘no criterion of
correctness’ for the reidentification of my ‘S’ sensations, no way of
proving that I was correct or incorrect in any case where I think I
have reidentified a feeling of ‘S’. It is like checking the time a train
leaves by calling up your memory of the timetable, but with one
important difference: there is no actual timetable out there in the
world to serve as the touchstone of correctness. Where there is no
possible way of checking up to see if I am correct in my application
of a term, the term cannot have any meaning. Consequently,
Wittgenstein’s conclusion is that giving names to your private
experiences by acts of private ostensive definition is a nonsensical
notion. Language is public, and the criteria for the application and
reapplication of words are public. No private language of the sort
envisaged above is possible.

This is not, of course, to deny that people have sensations and
experiences. However, from the point of view of the meaning of
language, if these experiences were necessarily private, they would
have no relevance. Imagine a situation in which everyone owned their
own box with something in it which we call a ‘beetle’. No one can
look inside anyone else’s box, and everyone claims to know what a
beetle is by looking inside their own box. In this sort of case,
Wittgenstein says, it wouldn’t matter whether everyone had the
same sort of thing in their box, or nothing at all. The thing in the
box doesn’t affect the meaning of ‘beetle’.

The consequence of Wittgenstein’s argument is that the picture
of the mind suggested by Descartes is untenable. We don’t each
inhabit our own private cinema. Rather, language sets the limits of
our thought, and language is an intrinsically public phenomenon. This
argument also undermines the view of the mind presented in the
empiricist tradition, including that given by Locke and Hume. Like
Descartes, these philosophers implicitly assume the possibility of
describing one’s own sensations in a private language: in particular,
Locke’s view of language relies on the possibility of reidentifying
privately labelled sensations.

Wittgenstein’s Private Language Argument isn’t entirely negative.
In place of the traditional account of the relationship between our
experiences and the language we use to describe them, he offers an
alternative hypothesis. Perhaps words like ‘pain’ are not names of
private sensations, but are rather part of our learnt pain- behaviour,
with public criteria for their correct application. A child hurts herself
and cries; adults teach the child to articulate the pain. What this means
is that the child learns to speak about pain as a substitute for crying.
Speaking about pain, however, is not simply a matter of describing
a sensation. According to Wittgenstein, speaking about pain is another
way of expressing pain.

SEEING ASPECTS
In the second part of Philosophical Investigations one topic which
Wittgenstein discusses involves the familiar example of the duck-
rabbit: a figure which can be interpreted as a drawing either of a duck
or of a rabbit, but not both simultaneously. I look at the figure and
see it as a duck; then, I see a new aspect of it: it looks like a rabbit.
This change of aspect has not been brought about by any change in
what is reflected on the back of my retina. Precisely the same visual
stimuli give rise to my sense that I am looking at a picture of a duck
as when I am seeing it as a rabbit. This seems paradoxical: the aspect
changes when no line of the picture has been altered. It suggests that
seeing involves a kind of judgement about what is being seen, and
that this can be influenced by what we expect to see.

CRITICISMS OF PHILOSOPHICAL
INVESTIGATIONS

Philosophical problems don’t all dissolve
Many philosophers remain unconvinced that all philosophical
problems arise when language ‘goes on holiday’. For example, few
contemporary philosophers of mind investigating the nature of
human consciousness feel that all they need do is point to some
of the ways we use language in order to rid ourselves for ever of the
philosophical problem of how matter could give rise to thought and
self-awareness. Wittgenstein’s claims about letting the fly out of
the fly-bottle are seductive; but traditional philosophical disputes
continue to perplex and challenge philosophers, despite his attempts
to explain them away as bewitchment by language. Wittgenstein,
presumably, would respond to this by pointing out that the philos -
ophers in question are still in thrall to the language they are trying
to force into doing jobs that it just can’t do.

Oracular pronouncements
A quite serious criticism of Wittgenstein’s style in Philosophical
Investigations is that it results in a book which is open to many
conflicting interpretations. In many places it is not at all clear what
the precise point of an example or parable is, nor is it always obvious
that some of the views he seems to be attacking have ever been held.
Often we seem to be getting just the tip of a submerged iceberg and
are left to ourselves to work out what must lie beneath the surface
of a remark. Although in recent years Wittgenstein’s notebooks and
his students’ lecture notes have been made widely available, there is
still fierce debate about some of his central doctrines.

Wittgenstein is surely responsible for the ambiguities and
indeterminacies in his work, not all of which can be put down to the
difficulty of presenting such radical and original ideas. Some of
the difficulties stem directly from his piecemeal approach. There
is no doubting the elegance and imaginative appeal of Wittgenstein’s
examples, but the lack of coherent argument or clarificatory passages
leaves the reader with a great deal of work to do.

In Wittgenstein’s defence, he was very open about his desire that
his readers think for themselves rather than have views dished out
to them by an authority. So in that sense contemporary disputes about
interpretation are a tribute to his success, since they indicate that
philosophers are having to think through what Wittgenstein could
possibly have meant in order to make sense of the work at all.

Nevertheless, Wittgenstein’s oblique and poetic style attracts
discipleship. There has never been a shortage of ardent followers who
cite paragraph numbers from Philosophical Investigations with all
the enthusiasm of religious zealots. These followers for the most part
are happy to get their ideas secondhand from the master, apparently
unaware that that is precisely what he said he didn’t want to happen.
The oracular style of much of Philosophical Investigations seems
to invite a reverential rather than critical approach, and so may
undermine the aim of making its readers think for themselves.

Wittgenstein himself was never satisfied enough with his drafts
of Philosophical Investigations to publish the book in his own lifetime.
Perhaps, then, it is fairer to treat it as work in progress, rather than
as his definitive views in the form he would have most liked them to
have reached the world.
