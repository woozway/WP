JOHN LOCKE AN ESSAY
CONCERNING HUMAN
UNDERSTANDING

Is a newborn’s mind a blank slate? Or do we come into the world
armed with knowledge? John Locke addressed these questions in
his Essay Concerning Human Understanding. His answer was that
all our knowledge is derived ultimately from the information we
receive from the five senses. We come into this world knowing
nothing whatsoever. Experience teaches us everything we know. This
view is usually known as empiricism, in contrast to innatism (the
theory that some of our know ledge is inborn), and to rationalism
(the contention that we can achieve knowledge of the world by the
power of reason alone). There was lively debate about the origins
of our knowledge when Locke was writing in the seventeenth century,
and this has continued, in a somewhat altered form, to the present
day.

Locke’s Essay, published in 1689, soon became a philosophical
bestseller. He produced four editions of it in his lifetime, and it had
already reached its eleventh by 1735. It is a complex and wide-ranging
work; its main focus is the origin and limits of human knowledge.
What can we know? What is the relation between thought and
reality? These are the perennial questions of the branch of philosophy
called epistemology, or the theory of knowledge. Locke’s answers to
them had a lasting influence on the course of the subject, and many
great philosophers, including George Berkeley (1685–1753) and
Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716) defined their own positions in relation
to them.

Locke described his role as that of an ‘underlabourer’ clearing away
conceptual confusions so that the scientists, or natural phil-
os ophers, as they were then known, could carry on their important
work of adding to human knowledge. This slightly self-deprecatory
remark shouldn’t blind us to the difficulty of the task which Locke
set himself, which was nothing less than to explain the origins and
nature of human knowledge. This involved a rejection of a whole
philosophical tradition which had been built on the assumption that
whatever was written by an authority such as Aristotle must be true.
Locke took great pleasure in overthrowing received opinion and
replacing it with reasoned hypothesis. His aim was to shed light on
what had until then been obscure. His motivation came from a love
of truth, and the exhilaration of thinking for oneself about some of
the most profound questions we can ask. He was under no illusion
that his would be the last word on any of the topics he discussed. Nor
was he particularly optimistic about human understanding in general:
he believed that God had given us the wherewithal to achieve
knowledge of God, of our moral duty and of whatever was necessary
to get through life, but that, ultimately, the powers of reason were
limited.

NO INNATE PRINCIPLES
Many seventeenth-century philosophers believed in the existence of
God-given innate principles, that is, principles that every human
being is born knowing. These might either be what Locke called
speculative principles, such as the obviously true statement ‘Whatever
is, is’; or else practical principles, such as the moral claim ‘Parents
have a duty to look after their children’ or ‘Everyone ought to keep
their promises.’ Locke used a range of arguments to show that neither
sort of principle was innate. Most of these arguments rely on his
fundamental assumption that the contents of the human mind are
transparent to itself: that is, if you are having a thought, then it must
be possible for you to get access to the content of that thought. Locke
does not believe that it makes sense to say that someone could be
having a thought without their knowing what that thought was
about. He rejects any notion of unconscious thoughts as nonsensical.

One argument he uses to support his claim that there are no innate
principles is that it is obvious that there is not total agreement
about what the supposedly innate principles might be. If we were
all born knowing that, for example, ‘We should keep our promises’,
then everyone would recognise this as a fundamental principle.
But, as Locke points out, there is no such general agreement. Some
people see no obligation whatsoever to keep their promises. Nor do
children immediately recognise the principle as one that is binding
on them; rather the principle is one that has to be taught and learnt.
The same holds for any principle you care to examine, moral or
otherwise.

Furthermore, we would expect the supposedly innate principles to
be more evident in children than in adults because children will have
been less affected by local customs and will have had less experience
of the world. The innate principles should be clearly recognisable in
them. But they aren’t.

The notion that there are innate moral principles shared by all
human beings is, for Locke, a complete non-starter since a glimpse
at history reveals the immense diversity of moral principles that have
been held by societies and individuals. It is simply implausible to think
that this would result from identical principles implanted in everyone’s
mind.

These and other arguments lead Locke to reject the view that there
are any innate principles. However, this leaves him with the task of
explaining how it is that the human mind comes to be furnished with
thoughts, beliefs and knowledge of the world. His answer is that all
our ideas come from experience.

IDEAS
Locke uses the word ‘idea’ to mean whatever it is that anyone thinks
about. When you look out of your window, what you see – a tree
perhaps, or a sparrow – is not the tree or sparrow itself, but rather a
representation of it, an idea, something like a picture in your head.
What you see is not just a product of what is out there in the world,
but is also in part a creation of your sensory system. But not all our
ideas are received from immediate sensation of the world. Some of
them are ideas of reflection, such as when we reason, or remember
or will something.

Locke believes that all our ideas ultimately come from experience,
so that the contents of our thoughts, even when we are reflecting
rather than perceiving, all come from sensation. A child locked away
from the world who had only had sensations of black and white would
have no more idea of scarlet and green than he would of the taste of
oysters or pineapple if he had never tried them.

Ideas can be combined in various ways, so that once we have the
idea of scarlet and the idea of a coat, we can imagine a scarlet coat,
even if we’ve never actually seen one. But the simpler ideas from
which the complex ones are built all originate in perception by one
or more of the five senses.

PRIMARY AND SECONDARY QUALITIES
When we say that a snowball is greyish-white and cold and round,
what we mean is that it can produce in us ideas of these properties.
Locke distinguishes primary and secondary qualities, giving a very
different account of each.

Primary qualities are inseparable from objects. The primary
qualities of a snowball would include its shape and solidity, but not
its colour or its coldness. Here Locke was very much influenced
by the science of his day, and in particular by the corpuscularian
hypothesis put forward by Robert Boyle (1627–1691). Boyle suggested
that all matter is composed of minute particles, or ‘corpuscles’, which
are grouped together in various ways. A single corpuscle alone in the
universe would still possess the primary qualities of shape, size
and solidity. The ideas that we have of an object’s primary qualities,
Locke believes, resemble those qualities. So, for example, if a snowball
has the primary qualities of roundness and a certain size, then the
ideas we have of these features resemble these aspects of the actual
snowball: they are accurate representations of these qualities.

Secondary qualities are powers to produce ideas. But secondary
qualities do not resemble their objects; they are, rather, a con-
sequence of the texture of corpuscles (i.e. the microstructure) out
of which the objects are composed, the particular conditions under
which they are perceived and the sensory system of the perceiver.
Secondary qualities, unlike primary ones, aren’t properties that
the corpuscles themselves have independently of observers. Take
colour, for instance: the snowball appears greyish-white. Colour is a
secondary quality. What this means is that the actual snowball does
not really have colour in the sense that it has shape and size. I have
an idea of the snowball as greyish-white. However, under different
lighting conditions it might appear to be a completely different
colour, blue, for instance. But in this case the blueness would no more
be in the snowball than is the greyish-whiteness. The colour of the
snowball derives from the arrangement of the corpuscles from
which it is composed; the primary qualities of the corpuscles give
rise to my ideas of it. The same is true of the snowball’s coldness,
and its taste. These are not strictly properties found in the snowball
but rather secondary qualities of the object dependent on its primary
qualities.

Locke’s discussion of primary and secondary qualities makes clear
his realism: his unquestioned belief in the existence of real objects
in the external world which give rise to our experience. This may
just sound like common sense, but many philosophers then, before
and since have been led to sceptical views about the nature of
whatever it is that causes our experience.

PERSONAL IDENTITY
One part of Locke’s Essay which has set the framework for most
subsequent discussion on the topic and continues to exert an influence
in the late twentieth century is the chapter ‘Identity and Diversity’.
This was only added to the work in the second edition. It contains a
discussion of the problem of personal identity, the question of what
it is that makes someone the same person after a period of time in
which they may have changed quite significantly, both bodily and
psychologically.

Locke’s answer to this question involves a discussion of three
separate but related questions: (1) What constitutes sameness of
substance? (2) What makes someone at a later date the same man?
and finally (3) What makes someone at a later date the same person?

We would say that we were dealing with the same substance if
none of the particles of which an object is composed have changed or
been removed. Clearly with a living organism this never occurs, since,
at least at a microscopic level, parts are continually being lost and
renewed. So sameness of physical substance won’t be a useful criterion
for determining personal identity over time, since no living human
being ever maintains precisely the same physical constituents from
moment to moment.

For Locke a ‘man’ is a particular biological organism, a member
of the species we call homo sapiens. A man is like an oak tree or
a horse in this respect. A huge spreading oak tree is still the same
oak it was twenty years ago, despite having doubled in size and shed
its leaves twenty times. It is not the same substance, but it is the
same oak, in virtue of the continued function of its living parts. In
the same way, I am the same man I was ten years ago, despite both
physical and psychological changes which anyone would be able to
notice.

Part of Locke’s originality on this topic lay in separating questions
about the identity of a man from those of a man’s personal identity.
But what exactly is a person if it is not the same as a man? According
to Locke, a person is ‘a thinking intelligent being, that has reason
and reflection, and can consider itself as itself, the same thinking thing
in different times and places’. In other words, a person isn’t simply
a member of our species, since some human beings lack the power
of reason and self-consciousness. Furthermore, in principle, some non-
human creatures could be considered persons. Locke cites a report
of a rational parrot that was able to answer quite detailed questions
in a convincing way. He points out that we would be unlikely to
call it a man, despite its intelligence: it would always be a rational
parrot, but it might also be considered a person if it had the appropriate
level of rationality and self-consciousness.

What, according to Locke, is the criterion of personal identity over
time? Not simply bodily continuity, since that does not guarantee us
that we are dealing with the same person. Rather personal identity
stretches only so far as consciousness will stretch: memory and
continuing recognition of being responsible for one’s past actions are
the conditions of personal identity. No matter how much I’ve changed
physically, if I can remember my past actions as my own, then I am
the same person that I was.

Locke illuminates this notion with a thought experiment. Imagine
that one day a prince wakes up to find that he has all the memories
of a cobbler, and none of his own. His body remains unchanged.
On the same morning a cobbler wakes up to find that he has all the
prince’s memories. Locke maintains that, although the prince-bodied
individual remains the same man, he is not the same person that he
was when he went to sleep. It would not be fair to hold the prince-
bodied person responsible for the prince’s former actions, since he
would not have any recollection of having performed them. This far-
fetched example is intended to bring out the important difference
between the terms ‘man’ and ‘person’.

But where does this leave us with cases of memory loss? It would
seem that on Locke’s account we should never punish people for what
they can’t remember doing since in an important sense they would
not be the same persons who committed the misdemeanours. ‘Person’
for Locke is a forensic term, by which he means that it is one which
is particularly relevant to legal questions which relate to responsibility
for one’s actions. It would seem then that we should never punish a
murderer who can’t remember killing. Locke’s view on this is that in
cases of memory loss or alleged memory loss, we tend to assume that
if we have identified the man who performed the actions, then this
must be the same person who committed them. We punish drunks
for their actions even if they claim not to be able to remember what
they did. However, this is simply a result of the difficulty of anyone
proving their ignorance of what they did. The law has to be practical
and so rarely accepts memory loss as an excuse. However, Locke
suggests, on the day of judgement, God will not hold anyone respon -
sible for actions which they can’t remember performing.

LANGUAGE
Locke is interested both in the nature of language and in its use in
effective communication. Language, for him, is not simply a matter
of making intelligible sounds: parrots (even non-rational ones) can
do that. Rather, words are signs of ideas: they signify them. Because
words are signs for ideas and all our ideas come from experience, all
our language and thought using language is intimately connected with
our experience.

By using words we can communicate our thoughts to others. But
Locke believes that we do not necessarily all attach the same ideas to
the same words. For instance, my particular associations for the word
‘albatross’ may be very different from yours on account of our
different experience of individual albatrosses. You may have had no
experience of an albatross, or only of a picture of one, and yet feel
confident in using the word. The idea you have associated with the
word would be very different from the idea held by someone who
saw albatrosses on a daily basis. If you have no clear idea of an
albatross you may just end up making sounds like a parrot that has
been taught to mimic or a young child, signifying nothing. So
although words are uttered in public, what they signify can still
be private and idiosyncratic. This can be a source of confusion and
misunderstanding.

There are far fewer nouns than there are things to which they
refer. This is not surprising, since if there were a name for every
particular thing it would be impossible to communicate effectively.
We use the general term ‘albatross’ to refer to a whole species of bird.
Locke maintains that we acquire such general words on the basis of
abstracting from our particular experiences.

CRITICISMS OF AN ESSAY CONCERNING
HUMAN UNDERSTANDING

Innate knowledge
Research by the linguist Noam Chomsky (1928– ) has resurrected
the debate about innate knowledge in the twentieth century. From
close analysis of the sentences used by children when learning to
speak he concluded that the best explanation for the universally
shared grammatical structures of different languages and the patterns
of children’s grammatical mistakes was an innate framework for
interpreting and using language that all children are born with, what
he called a Language Acquisition Device. This view provides a serious
challenge to Locke’s belief that a newborn’s mind is like a blank
piece of paper waiting to be written on by experience. It is much closer
to Gottfried Leibniz’s belief that the mind is like a block of marble
which has various fault-lines along which it is predisposed to break
to reveal a well-designed sculpture.

Do ideas of primary qualities resemble
their objects?
Locke’s account of the distinction between primary and secondary
qualities sounds plausible at first reading, and is lent support by the
various sensory illusions that suggest that secondary qualities are
qualities of objects as they appear to us, rather than actually being
somehow in the objects themselves. However, as George Berkeley
pointed out, Locke’s claim that ideas of primary qualities resemble
the objects themselves is unsupportable.

On Locke’s account, objects as they really are are hidden behind
a veil of perception. We only get direct access to ideas, not what
those ideas are of. So for Locke to maintain that ideas of primary
qualities resemble their objects is nonsensical. In order to ascertain
whether one thing resembles another we need access to both of them.
But on Locke’s account of the mind, we only ever have access to one
side: our own ideas. Berkeley went further than this, arguing that
because, strictly speaking, we only have access to the contents of
our own minds, we cannot even prove the existence of anything
independent of the mind. Locke, in contrast, simply assumes that the
mind could not produce our ideas without there being an external
world.

Homunculus problem
Locke’s account of ideas makes them very like pictures in the head.
But this doesn’t really explain much about the processes of thought,
because in order to appreciate what a picture is of, it seems to require
a little person (a homunculus) inside your head to interpret the
pictures, and then one inside his head, and so on. This infinite series
of ever smaller homunculi apparently implied by his account of the
mind is clearly an unacceptable consequence. It suggests that there
is something wrong with Locke’s account.

Memory loss doesn’t always sever
personal identity
The philosopher Thomas Reid (1710–1796) countered Locke’s claim
that memory provides an adequate criterion of personal identity with
the following example. Imagine a brave officer who was once flogged
at school for stealing from an orchard. In his first campaign as a young
soldier he succeeded in capturing a standard from the enemy. When
he captured the standard he could remember that he had been flogged
as a boy. Later, he was made a general. But by that time, although
he could remember capturing the standard, he could no longer
remember being flogged at school. The person who captured the
standard is, on Locke’s account, the same person who was flogged,
because of the memory link. Similarly, the memory link makes the
general the same person as the young officer who captured the
standard. Logic seems to tell us that if the boy is the same person as
the young officer, and the officer the same person as the old general,
then the boy must be the same person as the old general. Locke,
however, would have to deny this on the grounds that the old general
can’t remember being flogged, and so this link with the past is severed.
Reid’s point is that this is a logical absurd ity, because Locke’s account
gives us two contradictory conclusions: both that the boy and the
general are the same person, and that they are not. Any theory which
leads to such an obvious contradiction must be false.

Locke’s response to this sort of criticism would have to be that the
boy and the general are the same man but not the same person, and
that it would be wrong to hold the general responsible for what the
boy did. Locke would have to deny that the pattern of overlapping
memories described by Reid leads to the conclusion that the boy is
the same person as the general.

  of it, is inborn.
personal identity: what makes someone the same person despite bodily

primary qualities: properties of objects including shape and solidity,
  but not colour and coldness (which are secondary qualities). The
  ideas of primary qualities resemble those qualities (not so with
secondary qualities). The corpuscles of which an object consists
  themselves have primary qualities but not secondary qualities.
  rationalism: the belief that we can acquire knowledge simply through
  the exercise of our reason.
secondary qualities: powers to produce ideas. Secondary qualities are
  a product of the corpuscular texture of objects and the sensory

  of secondary qualities do not resemble the qualities themselves.
  Secondary qualities include such qualities as colour and coldness.
