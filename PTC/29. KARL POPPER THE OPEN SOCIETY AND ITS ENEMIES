KARL POPPER
THE OPEN SOCIETY
AND ITS ENEMIES

Karl Popper lived through the turmoil of the Second World War and
the political unrest in Austria that preceded its annexation to
Germany, the Anschluss. He managed to leave his native Austria
before Hitler arrived there, but it was news of this event that triggered
Popper to write The Open Society and Its Enemies. Jewish by descent,
though not religion, he realised the implications. By this time he was
living in New Zealand. While there he channelled his energies into
rethinking the history of political thought, writing his polemical book
that diagnosed the intellectual roots of totalitarianism and the sort
of society that might be able to resist its rise. The Open Society and
Its Enemies ostensibly focuses on the philosophers Plato, Hegel and
Marx, but in fact ranges far more widely than this might suggest.
Popper’s writing gains a sense of urgency and poignancy from the
wartime conditions in which he wrote it, with the fate of Europe
undecided and the rise of Fascism still unchecked; it was first published
in 1945 as Europeans were coming to terms both with the destructive
power of political authoritarianism and the need to rebuild societies
in ways which would immunise them against a recurrence of such
events. Shortly after publishing the book he took up a post at the
London School of Economics.

Popper made significant contributions to both the philosophy of
science (see Chapter 31, p. 270) and to political philosophy. The
adjective ‘Popperian’ is usually used to refer to his account of science
as a series of conjectures and refutations rather than confirmations
of hypotheses, the position that is known as ‘falsificationism’ (standing
in opposition to ‘verificationism’). Popper rejected the idea that science
was a process of finding confirmatory evidence: rather, he thought
scientists work by formulating bold but falsifiable hypotheses which
they then set about refuting. Logically no amount of supporting
evidence can absolutely confirm an empirical hypothesis, but observa -
tions can refute a generalisation. Scientists are imaginative thinkers
who generate hypotheses that they test to destruction, formulating
new hypotheses in the light of criticism of the old. Thus science makes
progress through piecemeal revision.

Popper’s book, The Open Society and Its Enemies, as its name
suggests, is a forceful attempt to defend a vision of an open society
against a range of threats that result in a closed one. In politics as in
science he saw the need for a model based on critical engagement
with the status quo. His political philosophy is, explicitly, an attempt
to apply the critical and rational methods of science to the organisation
of societies. Popper believed that democracy was the only political
arrangement that allowed for such reasoned critical debate and reform.
Plato, Hegel and Marx, are, he argued, the three principal intellec-
tual culprits guilty of laying the foundations of modern day totali-
tarianism. This book is in large part a sustained attack on their ideas
and influence. All three philosophers were advocates of large-scale
utopian reorganisation of society; Popper saw that as a fundamental
error and wanted to replace this style of thinking with a commitment
to what he called ‘piecemeal social engineering’.

WHAT DID POPPER MEAN BY AN OPEN SOCIETY?
An open society for Popper is one that allows individuals to question
and reject the presumed authority of those whose power comes merely
from tradition or from being part of an establishment. Members
of an open society attempt to establish new traditions based on
humaneness, freedom, equality and rational assessment. They subject
the policies that are put forward to criticism and if necessary abandon
them if they are shown not to bring about the hoped-for results.
Closed societies, in contrast, are deferential to authorities, who control
what can be thought and said and done.

PLATO’S TOTALITARIAN TENDENCIES
The Open Society and Its Enemies is iconoclastic – deliberately so.
Popper believed that we should not be overly deferential to ‘great
men’ (his term) merely because of the position they occupy. If we
are reluctant to criticise the thinkers that are part of our intellectual
heritage, he believed, we run the risk of ending that tradition
altogether.

The philosophical icon that Popper first attempts to knock from
their pedestal is Plato, undoubtedly one of the most revered
philosophers in history. But, Popper argued, it was Plato who was
responsible for sowing the seeds of totalitarianism in European
thought. Commentators before Popper tended to be uncritical in their
exposition of Plato’s Republic (see Chapter One), the book in which
he laid out his vision of how an ideal society would be run. Popper
stressed that Plato took pains to curb free thought in his republic,
legitimising censorship of any art or other communication that in his
view misrepresented reality or encouraged inappropriate emotional
engagement. Although purporting to value truth, Plato also argued
that members of the lower orders should be kept in their place by
means of a noble lie: they should be told that those who are born to
rule, the philosopher class, have gold in their blood, those who will
be members of the auxiliary class have silver, and the workers iron
and copper. This wasn’t just a suggestion by Plato about how a state
might be well run. He purported to be discovering the form or essence
of the ideal state, something changeless and discoverable.

HEGEL’S HISTORICISM
After his assault on Plato’s vision of society, Popper turns to the
eighteenth-century German, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.
Hegel is, he argues, the main source of contemporary historicism.
Historicism, for Popper, was an unscientific tendency to declare certain
outcomes inevitable – the mistaken idea that history has some
predictable and inevitable course to run based on supposed laws
according to which it unfolds. Much of The Open Society and Its
Enemies is directed at ridiculing this style of prophesy. Part of the
trouble with historicism is that it doesn’t leave any room for critical
engagement or refutation by means of evidence: it declares that things
will simply happen in one way, and removes the possibility that
human beings can shape their own political futures in the light of
experience. Historicism is at the heart of Hegel’s philosophy. It may
seem an innocuous intellectual position, but Popper believes it is a
style of determinist thinking that encouraged the totalitarianism of
mid-twentieth-century Europe. Popper doesn’t pull his punches, but
declares Hegelianism an intellectual fraud and his influence a farce,
albeit a dangerous one, particularly in the ways Popper believed it
fostered nationalism, celebration of the state and the sense of the
destiny of a people. He is very sympathetic to Schopenhauer’s critique
of Hegel’s philosophy as ‘colossal mystification’ and Hegel himself
as a charlatan.

MARX
Popper is not as aggressively dismissive of Marx as he was of Hegel.
Marx adopted Hegel’s historicism, and believed in the inevitable fall
of capitalism and the end of class struggle. For Marx, the role of
political activity was to make this happen smoothly to lessen the birth
pangs. Although Popper despises Marx’s historicism, and attacks
Marx for giving it an intellectual credibility that he thinks it doesn’t
merit, he does respect Marx’s attempts to find rational solutions to
social problems. He simply thinks he came up with the wrong answers,
answers which harm humanity. Marx, then, like Plato and Hegel
before him, was in Popper’s eyes an enemy of the Open Society.

CRITICISM OF THE OPEN SOCIETY AND ITS
ENEMIES

Caricatures Plato, Hegel and Marx
Some critics of Popper’s book argue that he misrepresents Plato,
Hegel and Marx, presenting their views in caricatured form in a way
that suits his purpose but fails to do justice to their actual views. In
particular, Popper is abusive and dismissive of Hegel’s thought. Yet
it is hardly surprising that a Viennese emigré writing during the
Second World War expressed anger at a philosopher whom he felt
was in part responsible for the rise of totalitarianism and a dangerous
nationalism.

GLOSSARY
falsificationism: Popper’s account of science which he claimed
  progresses through a series of bold hypotheses which scientists set
  out to refute. Only falsifiable statements are genuinely scientific.
historicism: any theory of history that made outcomes inevitable, such
  as Hegel’s. The view that history has a predictable course to run.
open society: an open society is one in which citizens are free to
  challenge authorities through critical debate and thereby bring
  about piecemeal social change.
totalitarianism: a form of closed society in which authorities control
  the people in a wide range of their day to day activities and free
  and open debate is impossible.
