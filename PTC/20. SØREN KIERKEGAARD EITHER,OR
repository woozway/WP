SØREN KIERKEGAARD
EITHER/OR

Either/Or is more like a novel than a philosophical treatise. And like
most novels it is resistant to paraphrase. Nevertheless, its central
concern is clear: it is the question asked by Aristotle, ‘How should
we live?’ Kierkegaard’s answer to this question is oblique enough
to leave a trail of contradictory and sometimes confusing interpre-
tations in its wake. On the surface, at least, it explores two funda-
mentally different ways of life, the aesthetic and the ethical. But it
does this from within: the views are not summarised, but rather
expressed by two characters who are the fictional authors of the work.

PSEUDONYMOUS AUTHORSHIP
Kierkegaard’s writing has a playful quality. One aspect of this is his
use of pseudonymous authorship: it is not just that Kierkegaard
writes under a series of pseudonyms; rather he creates fictional
characters, different from his own, in whose voices he writes.

The tone of Either/Or is set in the preface. The narrator, who
is called Victor Eremita, tells the story of how he came by the
manuscripts which are published as Either/Or. He had bought a
secondhand writing desk, an escritoire, which he had long admired
in a shop window. One day, just as he was leaving for a holiday,
a drawer of the desk jammed. In despair he kicked the desk, and a
secret panel sprang open revealing a hoard of papers. These, which
appeared to be written by two people whom he labelled ‘A’ and ‘B’,
he put into order and published. It emerges that B is a judge called
Wilhelm; we never learn the identity of A. This story is, of course,
a fiction; and A and B are fictional characters. The story of the
escritoire provides a metaphor for a central theme of the book: the
discrepancy between appearances and reality, or as Kierkegaard
usually puts it, ‘the inner is not the outer’.

The technique of using pseudonymous authors allows Kierke gaard
to distance himself from the views explored and expressed in the
book and to hide his own position behind that of his characters. But
it also allows him to get inside the various positions he evokes; to
investigate them from the point of view of the inner life of imagined
individuals rather than by means of the cool abstractions which
philosophers typically employ. This is an aspect of Kierkegaard’s
method of indirect communication: a self-conscious attempt to convey
truths about living human beings by showing aspects of their lives
rather than describing abstract and impersonal concepts.

EITHER
The first part of the book, called Either, is the part that is usually
read. Most readers find that A’s writing is more interesting and
diverse than the solid, somewhat laborious section written by B. Very
few of those who enjoy Either bother to slog through every page
of Or, even in the abridged versions in which it usually appears.
Nevertheless, parts of Or provide a detailed if biased commentary on
A’s approach to life, the aesthetic approach, while defending B’s own
ethical approach. A’s writing does not provide a direct description of
his approach to life; rather it exemplifies it through its concerns and
style of writing.

THE AESTHETIC APPROACH TO LIFE
In simple terms the aesthetic approach to life has at its heart the
hedonistic pursuit of sensual pleasure. But this does not adequately
characterise Kierkegaard’s use of the term, since it suggests a brutish
craving after physical satisfaction; whereas for Kierkegaard the
aesthetic approach includes the more refined pleasure-seeking of
the intellectual aesthete. The aesthete’s pleasures may come from the
contemplation of beauty, and the refined appreciation of works of art;
or they may include delight in the sadistic exercise of power, an
attitude revealed in the section of Either called ‘The Seducer’s Diary’.
All these pleasures are sought by A.

For Kierkegaard the aesthetic approach to life involves a restless
seeking after new pleasures, since the worst that can happen to
someone who adopts this way of life is that they become bored.
Boredom for the aesthete is the root of all evil. So A suggests a half-
serious strategy for avoiding boredom, which he jokingly labels ‘Crop
Rotation’.

CROP ROTATION
Crop Rotation involves arbitrarily changing your attitude to life, or
to whatever you happen to be involved in. Like the method by which
farmers replenish the soil’s nutrients, the arbitrary shifting of
viewpoint should replenish the individual and help stave off boredom.
A’s example is of having to listen to a bore: as soon as A started
con centrating on the drops of sweat running down the bore’s nose
the bore ceased to be boring. At this point Kierkegaard seems to sow
the seeds of surrealism in his celebration of arbitrary and perverse
approaches to life: he suggests just going to the middle of a play, or
reading only the third part of a book, thereby getting a new and
potentially stimulating angle on what could otherwise be tedious.

The restless shifting of topics and styles in the essays that make
up Either reflects the constant search for new stimulation characteristic
of the aesthetic approach to life. This is most apparent in the opening
section, called Diapsalmata (Greek for ‘refrains’), which is a series of
fragmentary comments and aphorisms. Other parts of Either are
presented as quasi-academic papers, or else, most notably, in one case
as a diary.

‘THE SEDUCER’S DIARY’
‘The Seducer’s Diary’ is a novella within Either. It is a brilliantly
written account of the cynical seduction of a young woman, Cordelia,
incorporating, as the title suggests, a diary, but also letters from the
woman to her seducer. It stands as a work of literature in its own
right; but within Either/Or it provides a case study of one way of
living within the aesthetic approach, an attempt to live life poetically
rather than ethically.

In the preface to Either/Or, Victor Eremita, the fictional editor of
the whole work, introduces the diary, which he claims to have found
amongst the papers in the escritoire; but there is a further level of
concealment of authorship in that the diary itself has a preface,
allegedly written by someone who knew the protagonists. Eremita
draws attention to what he calls this Chinese box, suggesting
that the diary’s editor might well be a fiction used by the seducer to
distance himself from what it describes. Of course as readers of
Either/Or we are immediately at a further level of remove from the
events than was Eremita, well aware that Eremita is simply another
mask worn by Kierkegaard, and that the events that the diary describes
are almost certainly creations of the philosopher’s imagination rather
than a description of something that actually happened. We might
also take his account of this distancing technique to apply equally to
Kierkegaard’s own use of pseudonyms and puzzles of authorship
throughout Either/Or: Eremita describes A’s attitude to ‘The Seducer’s
Diary’ as possibly being like someone who scares himself as he
recounts a frightening dream, suggesting that this might be why
he has to hide behind the mask of an imagined editor.

The seducer’s aim is to get a particular young woman to fall in
love with him. He succeeds in this, and then withdraws all affection.
His pleasure is not a simple physical gratification but a kind of
psychological sadism.

Seduction is the quintessential pastime of those who adopt the
aesthetic approach to life, and it is significant that an earlier essay
in Either, ‘The Immediate Stages of the Erotic’, is devoted to an
examination of Mozart’s Don Giovanni, an opera which follows the
fortunes of a serial seducer. For A, Don Giovanni is the supreme
achievement of a great composer. The underlying suggestion is
that A is drawn to this opera because in important ways the central
character’s lifestyle mirrors his own.

THE ETHICAL APPROACH TO LIFE
Whereas in Either the reader has to work hard to extract a sense of
the view that the writing illustrates and exemplifies, in Or views are
stated explicitly and mostly directed against aspects of A’s lifestyle.
The pseudonymous author of Or, B, or Judge Wilhelm, not only sets
out his own approach to life, but also criticises A’s own: thus, a far
clearer picture of Either’s meaning emerges when you read Or.

In contrast to A’s life spent in pursuit of pleasure, B advocates a
life in which the individual chooses his or her actions. As B describes
it, the life of the aesthete puts the individual at the whim of outside
events and circumstances, since we cannot simply choose the sources
of our pleasure, but must rely on aspects of the world to stimulate
us. The ethical approach, in contrast, is always motivated from within:
it is not a matter of learning a set of rules and obeying them, but
rather of transforming yourself into someone whose choices coincide
with duty. From this point of view, the aesthete A is merely hiding
behind a set of masks, shirking responsibility for his freedom. B
believes that such an approach requires a kind of self-deception. The
ethical approach requires self-knowledge. The point of adopting it is
to transform yourself into what B calls ‘the universal individual’, that
is, somehow to choose to become a model of humanity. This,
B claims, reveals the true beauty of humanity, in a way that the
aesthete’s purported pursuit of beauty never can.

READINGS OF EITHER/OR

An existentialist interpretation
According to the existentialist interpretation of Either/Or, the reader
is faced with a radical choice between the two approaches to life. There
are no guidelines which indicate how to choose: we must choose one
or the other, and thereby create ourselves through that choice.
However, contrary to the views which dominated the Enlight-
enment period, there is no such thing as a ‘right’ answer to the
question ‘How should I live?’ The reasons for choosing the ethical
above the aesthetic only make sense if you are already committed to
the ethical approach to life; to suggest that the aesthetic approach is
evil is to imply that you have already accepted that there is a good/evil
distinction to be drawn.

Similarly, the justifications for the aesthetic approach only appeal
to the aesthete, and would be ruled out as inconsequential by one
committed to the ethical way of life: the pleasures of seduction, for
example, would count for nothing in Judge Wilhelm’s reckoning. On
this reading Either/Or reflects the anguished position of all human -
ity. We find ourselves forced to choose, and through our choices we
create what we are. That is the human condition. Existentialists have
thus seen Either/Or as a key text in the history of the existentialist
movement. On this view Kierkegaard was one of the first philosophers
to recognise the importance of radical choice in the face of a world
in which no pre-ordained value can be discerned, thereby anticipating
many of the themes which would occupy Jean-Paul Sartre a century
later. It is certainly true that most twentieth-century existentialists
have been influenced by Kierkegaard’s writing.

The case for the ethical
Whilst there is much in Kierkegaard’s text which supports the
existentialist reading, some interpreters have seen the book as a thinly
veiled advocacy of the ethical above the aesthetic. B sees through A’s
aestheticism and presents him with a solid, if staid, alternative. Only
through seizing control of your life and putting it beyond contingent
events can you fulfil your nature. The aesthete is more or less at the
whim of what happens; the ethical approach ensures that the self
remains intact, even if chance events thwart your goals and desires.

One point against this interpretation of Either/Or is that it contra -
dicts his claim that there is no didacticism in the book. A further
objection is that so skilful a writer as Kierkegaard would not have
presented his favoured approach to life in so dry and unpalatable a
form. It is far from obvious why he would have given the aesthete
A all the best lines, and invented the staid and pontificating Judge
Wilhelm as the defender of his favoured view.

Thinly veiled autobiography
Kierkegaard met Regine Olsen when she was only 14; he was 21. Not
unlike the seducer in ‘The Seducer’s Diary’ he befriended her family,
and even her suitor. When Regine reached 17, Kierkegaard asked her
to marry him and she accepted. However, Kierkegaard could not go
through with the marriage and broke off the engagement in 1841,
just two years before Either/Or was published, leaving Regine
humiliated and in great distress. Some commentators have seen parts
of Either/Or as a response to his situation: of more psychological than
philosophical interest.

On this reading, Either presents the life of sensual pleasures that
Kierkegaard had led in his youth and would have to relinquish if he
married; Or, on the other hand, presents the case for marriage and
the acceptance of social responsibilities that that entails. The book
Either/Or can thus be seen as a literary expression of the torment
that led to the broken engagement; the philosophical surface is simply
another screen scarcely concealing the agonised soul in turmoil at the
most significant choice he had to make in his life.

This interpretation of Either/Or may well be accurate, but is
entirely compatible with either of the two interpretations sketched
above. It is interesting and informative to learn these biographical
facts about the man Kierkegaard. But ultimately his writing stands
or falls independently of its relation to his life and the psychological
motivations which gave him the energy to write.

CRITICISMS OF EITHER/OR

False dichotomy?
It is not obvious that the two ways of life exemplified by A and B
cover all the options. There may be C, D, E, F and G to take into
account. In other words, Kierkegaard seems to suggest that if you
reject the aesthetic the only option is the ethical, and vice versa.
However, this is a simplistic reading of Kierkegaard’s position.
Kierkegaard, or at least the character Victor Eremita, considers the
possibility that one person has written the texts of both Either and
Or, suggesting that perhaps the two positions need not be as
incompatible as they initially seem. And Kierkegaard need not be read
as suggesting that these are the only two options available: indeed,
in subsequent writings he explicitly outlines a third approach, the
religious attitude to life.

Indeterminacy
It should be clear by now that Either/Or is open to a wide range of
interpretations and that his original intentions are by no means easy
to discern. It is a book which seems to have a profound message; yet
critics are not agreed upon what that message is. Some say that this
is because Kierkegaard is unacceptably indeterminate about what he
means. This is a consequence of the style of writing he has chosen,
with fictional characters exploring lived philosophical positions. Since
characters exemplify rather than state their positions, there is some
latitude for interpretation. Those who want simple views clearly
stated in unambiguous prose will be disappointed by Kierkegaard’s
more poetic approach to philosophy.
