IMMANUEL KANT
GROUNDWORK OF THE
META PHYSIC OF MORALS

Good intentions count. The morality of an action is not determined
by its consequences, only by the intentions behind it. Morality is
objective: it’s not a matter of taste or culture, but applies equally
to all rational beings. The point of Immanuel Kant’s Groundwork of
the Metaphysic of Morals is to make these claims plausible by
establishing what he calls ‘the supreme principle of morality’, namely
the categorical imperative. The book was written as a short prelude
to his more complex and detailed work on moral philosophy. It has
stood the test of time as a succinct statement of a duty-based or
deonto logical moral theory.

THE GOOD WILL
The only thing in the world which is good without qualification is a
good will. What Kant means by this is that good intentions are good
unconditionally. Everything else which is good is only good under
certain circumstances. So, for example, courage might be considered
a good attribute to have, but on its own, it is not necessarily good: it
requires good intentions, that is, a good will, to guarantee its goodness.
Power, wealth and honour may be good; but equally without a good
will, they can all serve evil ends.

A good will is good in itself, not because of anything else that it
gives rise to. So, Kant tells us, provided that we have good intentions,
it doesn’t matter from a moral point of view if a ‘niggardly endowment
of step-motherly nature’ prevents us achiev ing what we set out to
do. Even when all our good intentions are thwarted by events outside
our control the good will still shines like a jewel.

This view contrasts sharply with consequentialist moral theories,
such as John Stuart Mill’s utilitarianism (discussed in a later chapter).
These judge the moral worth of an action by its actual or probable
consequences. For Kant, however, this is a mistake. Consequences are
irrelevant to assessments of moral worth, though they are, of course,
relevant to most other aspects of life.

DUTY AND INCLINATION
The only appropriate motive for moral action is a sense of duty. Some
people’s actions conform outwardly with their duties, but inwardly
they are acting only from self-interest. So, for example, a shrewd
shop keeper won’t overcharge an inexperienced customer because he
knows that ultimately this is bad for business. This is not acting from
duty, but only from prudence: enlightened self-interest. Acting from
a motive of duty is acting simply because you know that this is the
right thing to do, not from any other motive.

Duty stands in contrast to mere inclination. Some people happen
to have compassionate natures; if they see others in need, they are
moved to help them. Kant says that actions done solely from com -
passionate inclinations have no moral worth whatsoever. The motive
of duty is all-important. Someone who has no natural inclinations to
sympathy or compassion, yet who helps others out of a sense of duty,
is morally praiseworthy; those who act purely out of inclinations, no
matter how admirable those inclinations happen to be, are not acting
morally at all.

Kant’s reason for these surprising statements is that morality is
open to every rational being; yet our inclinations are outside our
conscious control. Ultimately it is a matter of luck whether or not
you happen to have a compassionate nature. He reinterprets the
Christian ‘love thy neighbour’, arguing that here the relevant kind
of love is what he calls a practical one, that is, acting out of a
sense of duty, rather than pathological love, which is the emotional
attitude which more usually goes by that name. In other words, Jesus
Christ wasn’t telling you how you should feel about your neighbour
when he said ‘love thy neighbour’, but rather instructing you to act
from your sense of duty.

MAXIMS
It is the underlying principles motivating an action which deter-
mine its moral worth, not the end result. Kant calls such principles
maxims. The same behaviour could be the outcome of very different
maxims. You might tell the truth on a particular occasion while
acting on the maxim ‘Always tell the truth’; but your behaviour
would on this occasion be indistinguishable if you were acting on the
maxim ‘Always tell the truth unless you are sure you can get away
with telling a lie.’ Only the first maxim is a moral one. Kant provides
a way of distinguishing moral from other maxims with his categorical
imperative.

THE CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE
Our moral duty arises from our respect for the moral law. The moral
law is determined by what Kant calls the categorical imperative.
A hypothetical imperative is a statement such as ‘If you want to
get other people’s respect, then you should keep your promises’:
it is a conditional statement. A categorical imperative, in contrast, is
a com mand such as ‘Keep your promises’: it applies uncondition-
ally, irre spective of your goals. Kant thinks that there is one basic
categorical imperative fuelling all our moral actions. He provides
several formulations of this imperative.

Universal moral law
The first formulation of the categorical imperative is ‘Only act on a
maxim that you could will should become a universal law.’ ‘Will’
here is very different from ‘want’: it means rationally intend. By
‘law’ he means a moral rather than a legal law (many actions which
transgress moral laws are perfectly legal). The idea is that if a maxim
is a genuinely moral one, then it ought to apply to everyone in
relevantly similar circumstances: it should be universalisable. It should
also be impersonal inasmuch as it shouldn’t make a special exception
for you. If an action is morally wrong, it is morally wrong for
everyone, including you. If an action is morally right, it is morally
right for anyone in relevantly similar circumstances.

In order to explain the implications of this formulation of the
categorical imperative, Kant uses the example of making promises
you don’t intend to keep. You might find it convenient to make
such promises sometimes, but, he says, you could not rationally
will the maxim ‘Break your promises when you are hard pressed’
for everyone. If the maxim were taken up universally, then the whole
institution of promising would be undermined. This would be self-
defeating. You wouldn’t be able to trust anyone to keep their promises.
So the maxim can’t be a moral one; you could not will it as a universal
law. Thus the categorical imperative provides a way of distinguishing
between moral and non-moral maxims. If you can’t rationally
universalise a maxim, it isn’t a moral one.

Treat people as ends
The second formulation of the categorical imperative is ‘Act so as
to treat others and yourself always as ends, never simply means to
ends.’ Rational beings are persons, that is, they are ends in them-
selves; they have their own lives to lead, and we should not simply
use them for what happens to suit us. We should recognise them as
individuals capable of leading their own lives. To treat someone
merely as a means to my own ends is tantamount to denying their
essential humanity. Another way of putting this is that we should
respect other people’s autonomy. It would be treating someone as a
means to an end if I promised to pay him back the money he leant
me, even though I never really intended to do so. Recognising him
as an end in himself would entail intending to and actually keeping
my promise.

The kingdom of ends
A further formulation of the categorical imperative is expressed in
terms of a kingdom of ends: ‘Act as if through your maxims you
were a law-making member of a kingdom of ends.’ A kingdom of
ends is an imaginary state whose laws protect individual autonomy,
allowing everyone to be treated as an end rather than as a means to
an end. Here Kant makes clear that morality is not just a matter
of individual conduct, but also the foundation of societies. Kant’s
approach is designed to discriminate between principles which rational
agents would adopt for their ideal state and those which they would
reject. A principle which you could not will to be a law in this ideal
state fails to pass this test, and so is not a moral principle.

KANT, ARISTOTLE AND MILL
Kant’s approach to moral action contrasts sharply both with Aristotle’s
and Mill’s. Kant treats emotions as either irrational or irrelevant
to moral action; only the practical emotions, which aren’t emotions
in the ordinary sense of the word, have any direct part to play in
morality. Aristotle, in contrast, argues that the cultivation of appro-
priate emotional responses is a central aim of moral education.
Aristotle’s philosophy is flexible, based on sensitivity to circumstances;
Kant’s is rigid in its adherence to general principles which admit of
no exceptions.

Kant’s approach to morality also contrasts with a utilitarian one
such as Mill’s. Kant dismisses the consequences of actions as irrelevant
to our moral assessment of them; whereas for Mill the con sequences
of an action determine its moral worth. Mill’s approach gives
guidelines for discriminating between competing moral claims: assess
the consequences and choose the option which will maximise aggre -
gate happiness. Kant’s moral philosophy gives no method of choosing
between two actions both of which are moral; or for that matter
between two actions both of which are immoral.

Aristotle, Kant and Mill provide three distinctively different
approaches to morality. Like Aristotle’s and Mill’s, Kant’s theory is
open to a number of criticisms.

CRITICISMS OF THE GROUNDWORK OF THE
METAPHYSIC OF MORALS

It is empty
A common criticism of Kant’s moral theory is that it doesn’t pro-
vide any content to ethics. It concentrates on the structure of moral
judgements, their universalisability and impersonality, rather than
helping us to discover precisely what we ought to do. Worse still,
using Kant’s own test for moral judgements, it seems that we could
quite easily universalise some quite obviously immoral principles,
such as ‘Always use the most efficient means of farming regardless
of animal welfare’: there is nothing inconsistent about willing this
principle. Because most animals would fail to meet the appropriate
threshold of rationality for Kant, the version of the categorical
imperative which enjoins us to treat others as ends and not means
would not save them here. So Kant would have to say that this
maxim was a moral one.

Even the example of promise-breaking that Kant uses seems open
to criticism. If you have a maxim ‘Break your promises whenever
you can get away with it’, then, provided that no one else knows that
this is your policy, it might appear that there is nothing self-
contradictory in willing it. If everyone acted on the same maxim, the
institution of promising could still survive. However, Kant’s response
would be that breaking a promise is absolutely wrong and that you
could not rationally will the maxim in question. This is because
willing such a maxim would entail willing not only that I break
promises when I can get away with it, but also that other people
treat their promises to me in the same fashion. So I would, in willing
the maxim, effectively be willing that I have promises broken to
myself.

The role of emotion
Kant’s moral philosophy treats the emotions and individual character
traits as irrelevant to our moral assessments of individuals. It doesn’t
matter for Kant if you are hard-hearted, provided that you act out
of a reverence for the moral law. Yet, for many of us, genuine
compassion is the core of morality, not a potentially distracting quirk
of individual psychology. We admire people who have a special
capacity for sympathy and compassion, and this admiration seems to
be an admiration of qualities relevant to them as moral beings. Kant’s
approach, which focuses on what any rational being should do, ignores
the centrality of emotions to human moral interaction. The practical
emotions which he wants to substitute for the pathological ones
scarcely seem to merit the label ‘emotion’ at all.

A caricature of Kant’s attitude to emotions suggests that he always
considers them obstacles to genuine moral action. However, in fact
what he argues is that emotions and inclinations can cloud the issue
of whether or not you are acting morally. This is particularly relevant
if you find yourself in a situation in which you happen to feel a strong
emotional inclination to act in the way that the categorical imperative
indicates anyway.

For example, you might, when walking around London, be
approached by someone begging for money. The sight of this person
stirs up feelings of compassion that have you reaching for your purse;
but you also recognise a moral duty, following from the categorical
imperative, enjoining you to give money to this person. In such a
situation it may be difficult or even impossible to tell what your real
motivation for giving money is: is it an inclination, or is it reverence
for the moral law? However, if your immediate response to being
asked for money was revulsion and irritation, yet you still acted
according to the categorical imperative, then you would have no
trouble in knowing that you had acted morally. Kant doesn’t rule out
the possibility that those who feel compassion also act from reverence
for the moral law; what he does say is that acting from compassion
alone will not make your action a moral one.

Nevertheless, Kant’s dismissal of emotion dehumanises moral
relations. The coldly rational responses which he points to as models
of moral behaviour seem to be less human and less desirable than
appropriately emotional ones.
