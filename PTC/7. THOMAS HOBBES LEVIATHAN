THOMAS HOBBES
LEVIATHAN

The frontispiece of Thomas Hobbes’ Leviathan is one of the few
memorable pictorial representations of a philosophical idea. A huge
man, whose body is composed of thousands of smaller people, towers
above the well-ordered city below. The church spire is dwarfed by
this giant who wears a crown and wields a sword in one hand, a sceptre
in the other. This is the great Leviathan, the ‘mortal god’ described
by Hobbes. The Leviathan, which appears in the Old Testament as a
sea monster, is Hobbes’ image for the powerful sovereign who
represents the people and is in a sense their embodiment: the
multitude united in the form of an artificially created giant.

In Leviathan Hobbes diagnoses the general causes of strife and
conflict and identifies a cure. The central arguments of the book
address the question of why it is reasonable for individuals to consent
to be ruled by a powerful sovereign (which could be either a single
figure or an assembly). Peace can only be achieved if everyone accepts
a social contract. Hobbes’ discussion of these issues is at the heart of
Leviathan, but the book touches on numerous other topics from
psychology to religion. In fact more than half of Leviathan is devoted
to detailed discussion of religion and Christian scripture: the half that
is seldom read today. Here I focus on the main theme of the book,
the contract which free individuals make to give up some of their
natural freedom in return for protection from each other and from
outside attack. Hobbes begins his account of this contract with an
analysis of what life would be like if no society or commonwealth
existed.

THE STATE OF NATURE
Rather than describing actual societies, Hobbes breaks society down
into its most basic elements: individuals fighting for their survival
in a world of limited resources. He invites the reader to imagine the
conditions of life in a state of nature, the condition in which we would
find ourselves if all state protection were removed. In this imagined
world there would be no right or wrong since there would be no laws,
there being no supreme power to impose them. Nor would there be
any property: everyone would be entitled to whatever they could
acquire and hold on to. For Hobbes morality and justice are the
creations of particular societies. There are no absolute values which
hold independently of particular societies. Right, wrong, justice,
injustice are values determined by the sovereign powers within a
state, rather than somehow discovered pre-existing in the world. So,
in the state of nature there would be no morality whatsoever.

Hobbes’ account of the state of nature is a thought experiment
designed to clarify the limits of political obligation. If you find the
state of nature unattractive, then you have an excellent reason for
doing whatever it takes to avoid ending up in it. The state of nature
is a state of perpetual war of every individual against everyone else.
Since there is no powerful law-giver or law-keeper, no co-operation
between individuals is possible. Without such power no one need keep
any promises they make since it is always in their interest to break
the promises when it suits them. Assuming that you have a strong
desire to survive, it is simple prudence to break agreements when it
suits you in the state of nature. If you don’t seize what you need
when you can get away with it, you run the risk of someone else
stealing what little you have. In this situation of direct com-
petition for meagre resources essential for survival, it makes sense
to mount pre-emptive attacks against anyone who you think might
pose a threat to your safety. This is the most effective strategy for
survival. Even if there isn’t any fighting going on, Hobbes says, this
is still a state of war, since there is the constant threat of violence
breaking out.

In a state of nature there can be no human projects which require
co-operation, such as extensive agriculture or architecture. Even the
weakest can potentially kill the strongest, so no one is safe, and
everyone is a possible threat. Hobbes memorably described life in the
state of nature as ‘solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short’. If you
are faced with the possibility of such a life, giving up some of your
freedom seems a small price to pay for peace and safety. Hobbes
explains what individuals in a state of nature must do to escape their
unattractive predicament. Fear of a violent death and desire for the
benefits of peace provide strong motives for doing so.

In the state of nature everyone has a natural right to self-
preservation, and they continue to have this right even after other
rights have been given up in the social contract. Hobbes contrasts
this natural right with natural laws. A right identifies something
which you are free to do should you so wish, but are not obliged to
do; a law compels you to follow its dictates.

LAWS OF NATURE
Even in the state of nature there are laws of nature: these are laws
which follow from the use of reason. They are not like the present-
day law against drink-driving: Hobbes used the term ‘civil law’ to
refer to this kind of proscription (the content of civil laws is deter-
mined by the sovereign or by people acting on his behalf). Laws of
nature, in contrast, are principles that any rational person is bound
by. In the state of nature everyone has a right to everything. The
inevitable consequence of this is, as we have seen, lack of security
and a state of constant war. The law of nature which reason gives
in these circumstances is Seek peace wherever possible. A second
law of nature is When others are prepared to do the same, give up
the rights you have in the state of nature and be content with
as much freedom in relation to others as you would grant them
in relation to you (this is a version of the religious prescription to
Do as you would be done by). Hobbes constructs quite a long list
of laws of nature, the consequence of which is that, provided that
others are prepared to do likewise, it is rational for anyone in the
state of nature to give up their unlimited freedom in return for
security.

THE SOCIAL CONTRACT
The rational course of action is to make a social contract, yielding
freedoms to a powerful sovereign. The sovereign must be powerful
enough to be able to enforce any promises made, because, as Hobbes
points out, ‘covenants without the sword, are but words, and of no
strength to secure a man at all’. The sovereign’s power guarantees
that the people will do what they have undertaken to do. The result
is peace.

It is true that some animals, such as bees and ants, appear to live
in societies which run smoothly without the need for any coercive
direction from above. Hobbes points out that the human situation is
very different from that of bees and ants. Human beings are con-
stantly in competition for honour and dignity, which leads to envy
and hatred and eventually war; ants and bees have no sense of honour
and dignity. Human beings have the power of reason, which equips
them to find fault with the way they are governed, and this gradually
brings about civil unrest; ants and bees have no such power of reason.
Human beings only form societies by means of covenants; ants and
bees have a natural agreement with each other. Consequently human
beings need the threat of force to guarantee that they will not break
their promises, even though ants and bees don’t.

For Hobbes the social contract is a contract made with other
individuals in a state of nature to give up your natural rights in
exchange for protection. This contract need not have historical reality:
Hobbes is not claiming that at a certain point in the history of each
state, everyone suddenly agreed that fighting wasn’t worth the energy
and that it would make more sense to co-operate. Rather he provides
a way of understanding, justifying and changing political systems. One
way of reading Leviathan is to take Hobbes to be saying that if the
existing conditions of an implicit contract were to be removed, then
we would find ourselves in a state of nature with its war of everyone
against everyone. If Hobbes’ argument is sound, and his portrayal of
the state of nature accurate, then Leviathan provides compelling
reasons for maintaining peace under the rule of a powerful sovereign.

THE SOVEREIGN
The sovereign, whether an individual or an assembly, becomes an
artificial person. Once the wills of all have been bound together by
the social contract then the sovereign is the living embodiment of the
state. Although Hobbes allows for the possibility of a sovereign
assembly (that is, a group such as a parliament rather than an all-
powerful individual), his sympathies are with a strong monarchy.
However, he had little respect for the then widely held view known
as the divine right of kings, according to which God approved of
succession to the throne and gave sacred rights to royal heirs.

The social contract does not remove the natural right of self-
protection that individuals have in the state of nature. Hobbes went
so far as to say that everyone has a natural right to save themselves,
even if attacked by people acting on behalf of the sovereign. The
condemned man on the way to his execution, even if he had agreed
to abide by the law, and had had a fair trial, would not act unjustly
if he resisted the soldiers charged with taking him to the scaffold.
However, no one has the right to intervene to help someone else in
such circumstances. You can only struggle to save your own skin.

THE PRISONERS’ DILEMMA
Some present-day commentators on Hobbes’ work point out the
similarity between his discussion of the state of nature and what is
known as the prisoners’ dilemma, an imaginary situation designed
to illustrate certain problems about co-operation with other people.
Imagine that you and your partner in crime have been caught, but
not red-handed; you are being interrogated in separate cells. You don’t
know what your partner has or hasn’t owned up to.

The situation is this: if neither of you confesses, then both will go
free, because the police don’t have enough evidence to convict you.
At first thought this seems the best course of action. However, the
catch is that if you remain silent and your partner confesses and
thereby incriminates you, he will be rewarded for his collaboration
and also set free, whereas you will get a long prison sentence. You
too can have a reward if you confess but he doesn’t. If it turns out
that you both confess, you both get a short sentence. In this situation,
whatever your partner in crime does, it makes sense for you to
confess (assuming that you want to maximise your own benefit). This
is because if he doesn’t confess, you stand to get the reward as well
as being released; and if he does confess, then it is far better for you
to go to prison for a short while than end up there for a long time
because he has incriminated you. So if you are both out to maximise
your rewards and minimise your sentences, you will both confess.
Unfortunately this produces a worse outcome for each of you than
if you had both remained silent.

Hobbes’ state of nature is similar in that, in it, it always makes
sense for you (and everyone else) to break a contract when you stand
to gain from it. Keeping the contract is risky: the worst scenario occurs
if you keep the contract and someone else breaks it. If the other person
keeps it, then you will most likely profit by breaking it. If the other
person breaks it, then you should cut your losses by breaking it too.
So either way you should not keep your contract. There is, in this
situation, no incentive for a rational individual intent on getting the
best result for him or herself to keep any contract. This is why
Hobbes has to introduce the notion of the sovereign, since without
such a powerful enforcer of contracts, no one would have an incentive
to keep any promise they made. The contract with others to concede
your rights to the sovereign is different from other contracts in that
if you break it then you will be punished for this, probably severely.
So in this case you have a strong incentive to keep the basic social
contract.

CRITICISMS OF LEVIATHAN

Mistaken view of human nature?
A frequent criticism of Hobbes’ description of the state of nature
is that it paints an unduly bleak picture of human nature outside
the civilising influence of the state. Hobbes believes that at heart
we are all egoists, constantly seeking to satisfy our desires. He is
a strict materialist, believing that the whole universe and every-
thing in it can be explained in terms of matter in motion. Human
beings are like sophisticated machines. In contrast to his somewhat
pessimistic view that it is inevitable that human beings will compete
and fight when the veneer of civilisation is stripped away, some more
optimistic philosophers have claimed that altruism is a relatively
common human trait, and that co-operation between individuals is
possible without the threat of force.

However, in Hobbes’ defence, his theory does seem to describe
the sorts of rivalries and aggression that hold between countries in
international relations. If it weren’t for mutual mistrust there would
be no need to stockpile nuclear weapons. But if Hobbes’ theory does
apply between states as well as within them then the future is even
bleaker, for it is unlikely that a sovereign powerful enough to enforce
covenants made between states will emerge, and so we can expect a
perpetual war of all against all (even if this is not a literal war, only
a state of potential conflict).

Social parasites
A further criticism of Hobbes’ account is that he doesn’t provide any
reasons for someone to abide by the social contract when they can
get away with breaking it. Why should a pickpocket abide by civil
laws against theft declared by the sovereign if he is sure he won’t be
caught? If, as Hobbes argues, force is needed to make people in the
state of nature keep their covenants, then, presumably, the same
people will need to be forced to keep civil laws. But no state can watch
everyone all the time, not even one equipped with closed-circuit
television cameras.

Hobbes would probably answer this criticism by maintaining that
it is a law of nature that you should not accept the state’s protection
without accepting the obligation to keep the state’s civil laws.
However, this answer is not really adequate.

State of nature pure fiction
A fundamental criticism of Hobbes’ methodology is that his state of
nature is a meaningless fiction which bears no relation to history and
is set up in such a way that it allows him to smuggle in his monarchist
prejudices as if they were the conclusions of rational arguments.

On the first point, although he does think that some native
Americans lived in a state approximating the state of nature, it is
generally agreed that Hobbes doesn’t intend his account to be any-
thing more than hypothetical. He points out what life would be like
if there were no sovereign power, or if a sovereign power were
removed. However, as we have seen, his assumptions about what that
state would actually be like can be challenged, as can the value of a
thought experiment which is so unlike what actually happens.

On the question of smuggled prejudices, it is interesting that
Hobbes allows that the sovereign may be an assembly rather than
just a monarch. If Hobbes is simply revealing his monarchist
prejudices, the inclusion of this possibility seems beside the point;
unless, of course, Hobbes was rationally considering his own self-
preservation (which would be consistent with his philosophical views
about human nature), not wanting to commit himself in public to
too extreme a form of monarchism.

Totalitarian?
Like Plato before him, Hobbes seems content to reduce citizens’
freedom considerably in his ideal state. For instance, he thinks
censorship by the sovereign entirely acceptable, and indeed desir-
able: no book should be published before its doctrines have been
examined and assessed for their tendency to promote peace. The
commonwealth is an intolerant place, and individuals’ consciences are
not to be taken seriously. It is for the sovereign to declare what is
right or wrong, and the individual should not attempt to make such
judgements. Many of us would find this aspect of Hobbes’ alterna-
tive to the state of nature particularly unattractive. Even though
Hobbes set limits on the power of the sovereign to do whatever
he or she likes, these limits are not sufficiently stringent to prevent
the commonwealth becoming a totalitarian state with all that that
involves.

Hobbes’ probable response to this sort of criticism is given in
one of his section headings: ‘sovereign power not so hurtful as the
want of it’. Yet, at a certain point even the rigours of the state of
nature would seem preferable to life under some totalitarian regimes.
Some might opt for a solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short life in
preference to one of virtual enslavement.

GLOSSARY
civil laws: rules created by human beings (contrasted with natural
laws).
commonwealth: a group of individuals joined together by a social
contract to form a political body.
divine right of kings: the notion that the succession of rulers through
birth is God’s will.
Leviathan: an Old Testament sea monster, taken by Hobbes as a
metaphor for the great body of the state composed of all its
members joined together by a social contract.
natural laws: rules which are given by reason and which hold even
in the state of nature. Any rational person is bound by them. They
include the law: seek peace wherever possible.
prisoners’ dilemma: a type of thought experiment designed to bring
out important features of situations of co-operation and con-
flict. It involves the notion of two prisoners in separate cells
each calculating whether or not it is rational to reveal the other’s
guilt.
rights of nature: basic rights, which entitle you to act according to
them if you so wish. An example of a right of nature is the right
to self-preservation, which we all have in virtue of being human
and which can’t be overridden by socially constructed laws.
social contract: an agreement to give up some freedoms in return for
protection by a sovereign. The social contract permits the move
from a state of nature to a civil society.
sovereign: a powerful individual or group of individuals acting as one
person who provides protection for members of society in return
for their giving up some of the freedoms they have in a state of
nature. The sovereign enforces contracts made between members
of the society.
state of nature: a hypothetical situation in which we would find
ourselves if society broke down. It is a state of perpetual war with
every individual ready to attack every other.
