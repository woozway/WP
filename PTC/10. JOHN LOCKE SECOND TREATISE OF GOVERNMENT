JOHN LOCKE
SECOND TREATISE
OF GOVERNMENT

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pur-
suit of happiness ... that whenever any government becomes
destruc tive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or
to abolish it.

These resounding lines from the American Declaration of Indepen-
dence of 1776 paraphrase the message at the heart of John Locke’s
Second Treatise of Government, written almost a century earlier.
Locke published his Two Treatises of Government anonymously in
1689, but there is evidence that he wrote them in the early 1680s
when the idea that the people had a right to overthrow an unjust
government would have been considered radical treason and could
easily have incurred the death penalty. Much of the detail of
the Two Treatises is directed at the turbulent political events of the
1680s; but the Second Treatise, with its attempt to establish basic
human rights, has had an influence which extends well beyond the
concerns of the seventeenth century.

FIRST AND SECOND TREATISES
Of the Two Treatises, the second is by far the more interesting. The
First Treatise is almost entirely negative: it is a critical attack on the
ideas of Sir Robert Filmer. Filmer argued that the monarchy’s power
was God-given and had nothing whatsoever to do with the consent
of the people, a view known as the divine right of kings. Adam, the
first man, had been given authority over the whole earth by God; the
authority of present-day rulers could then be traced back to this initial
gift. The people’s duty to obey their rulers was a duty to God since
the rulers were there by God’s will as a result of a subdivision of the
world since the time of Adam. What the people wanted was beside
the point. Everyone had an absolute duty to obey the monarch and
this duty was, indirectly, a duty to obey God.

In the First Treatise Locke demolishes the detail of Filmer’s
argument; in the Second Treatise he outlines his positive account of
government. The question that Locke addresses there is, ‘What are
the sources and limits of legitimate political authority?’ Or, to put it
in a more practical form, ‘Why should we obey our rulers, and under
what circumstances might we be justified in opposing them?’

THE STATE OF NATURE AND LAWS OF NATURE
In order to answer these questions, Locke, like many political
philosophers before and since, imagined what life would be like in a
state of nature, that is, in a world with no government-imposed laws
and no organised society. This sort of thought experiment is not
usually intended to give an account of what life was actually like at
some particular point in time, but rather is a story invented to bring
out the philosophical justifications for forming a society with a
government and laws. Hobbes thought that in a state of nature we
would be in a state of permanent war against each other, competing
for scarce resources; Locke’s state of nature, in contrast, is a far more
attractive prospect. For Hobbes individuals in the state of nature
would be driven by their appetites and desires, and for them prudence
would dictate that they took pre-emptive action against any would-
be competitors. Locke, however, believes that even in a state pre-
existing any organised society human beings would be bound by what
he calls the laws of nature, and that these prohibit harming others.

The laws of nature are God-given laws which any human being
is capable of discovering by reflection. In Locke’s state of nature
individuals are both equal and free. There is no natural hierarchy
that sets one human being higher than another: everyone counts the
same as everyone else and is equal before God. Individuals are also
free, but this liberty should not be confused with licence (freedom to
do whatever you want). Your freedom, even in a state of nature, is
limited by the self-evident God-given laws of nature which prohibit
you from committing suicide (since God clearly intended you to live
out your natural lifespan), and from harming other people (since God
created us as equals not to be used by one another).

One reason why Locke’s state of nature appears so much more
congenial than Hobbes’ brutal war of all against all is that Locke
believes that the laws of nature can be enforced by any individual.
This includes meting out punishment for breaking the laws of nature.
Even outside society the God-given laws hold and are enforceable. If,
for example, you were to attack me without good reason, then, since
the law of nature forbids harming anyone without justification, I
would be within my natural rights to punish you, both in order to
get some kind of reparation and to restrain you from further violence.
This right to punish extends to those who are not directly involved.
Someone else might learn that you had attacked me, and choose to
punish you accordingly. Obviously in the state of nature there would
be a danger that individuals would be biased in the ways they upheld
the laws of nature. They would tend to promote their own interests
under the guise of applying the laws of nature. That is one of the
reasons why joining together and forming a government is an
improvement on the natural state, since a government can set up an
independent judiciary.

PROPERTY
One of the fundamental rights that everyone in the state of nature
has is a right to property. Locke sometimes uses the word ‘property’
to cover more than what we would understand by the word (land,
buildings, personal belongings and so on). For Locke we also have a
property in ourselves, that is, we own ourselves and have a right to
do what we will provided that we don’t harm others or take our own
lives. Locke’s account of the origin of property in the state of nature
only deals with property in the familiar sense, and principally with
land and the fruits of agriculture. Unfortunately he doesn’t explain
how it is that each of us has a property in ourselves.

How, then, do individuals acquire rightful claims on land,
particularly in view of the religious doctrine that God handed the
world over to Adam to be held in common by all humanity? The
essence of Locke’s answer is that human labour, which adds to the
value of the land, gives a right of property in the state of nature,
provided that no one else has a prior claim on the land. The labourer
who ‘mixes’ his or her labour with the land is entitled to that land.
Imagine someone in the state of nature who lives by foraging for
nuts and seeds from wild trees and plants. If he collects a bag full of
this meagre food, then it rightfully belongs to him in virtue of the
work he has put into gathering the foodstuff. Similarly, someone who
mixes her labour with the land, who digs, plants and reaps a harvest,
has a rightful entitlement to the land and its crop. However, there
are strict limits on the quantity of goods which can be acquired in
this way: the limit set by the law of nature is that no one should take
more than they can actually use. If the forager’s nuts and seeds go
mouldy before he gets round to consuming them, or the planter stores
away crops which spoil, then they are both liable to punishment for
transgressing the law of nature which limits an individual’s property
to what he or she can use. In effect, the forager or planter who takes
too much encroaches on his or her neighbour’s share.

MONEY
However, because of the inherent perishability of so many of the
necessities of human existence, particularly food, human beings
typically agree to give value to some less perishable objects such as
gold or silver. By mutual consent, individuals in the state of nature
undertake to exchange perishable goods for these non-perishable
objects. Thus money is invented. And money transforms the possi-
bilities of property-acquisition in the state of nature since it allows
individuals to amass large amounts of property without risking
spoilage. For example, a farmer can grow large amounts of corn and
then exchange anything that he doesn’t eat for money. Thus he
acquires a valuable and lasting commodity which can be exchanged
for the necessities of life as required. He also helps to feed other
members of the community. By tacitly agreeing to the institution of
money, Locke believes, we have all accepted the material inequality
between individuals which almost inevitably follows from it.

CIVIL SOCIETY
So far we have just looked at what Locke has to say about the state
of nature, a situation governed by God-given laws of nature. How-
ever, one of his main aims is to show how what he calls a civil society
or a commonwealth (he uses the terms interchangeably) can come
into being, and how the members of such a society stand to benefit
by its existence.

The principal motivation for leaving the state of nature is a need
for protection: protection of life, liberty and property, and especially
the last of these. Although in the state of nature everyone is entitled
to punish anyone who breaks a law of nature, inevitably self-interest
affects the partiality of those who are asked to judge their neighbours.
In order to guarantee a peaceful life it is necessary to move from the
state of nature into an organised society. This involves giving up some
of the rights you have in the state of nature. In particular it involves
waiving the right to mete out punishment for transgressions of the laws
of nature. By mutual agreement members of a society give up this right
because of the greater safety they stand to gain by doing so. They put
the power of making and enforcing laws in the hands of some individual
or group of people entrusted to act for the common good.

The only way in which individuals can give up some of the
freedoms of the state of nature is by giving their consent. Locke writes
of the ‘compact’ that individuals make one with another, by which
he means the agreement or contract: it is his term for what is usually
known as the social contract. If this compact is entered into freely
and explicitly, it is what he calls an express agreement; when the
compact is simply implied by behaviour rather than explicitly agreed
on, it is a tacit agreement.

You might object that you weren’t born into a state of nature, but
rather found yourself in the midst of an organised society with laws
and government already in place. How, then, can you have consented
to giving up some of your basic rights? The notion of govern-
ment by consent might seem implausible, given that you have never
consciously consented to the present situation. Locke’s response is
that anyone who benefits from the protection of their property in
a civil society, or enjoys the other benefits which such an organisation
can bring, has thereby made a tacit agreement to give up some natural
rights. Once the social compact has been made, the individual
implicitly agrees to be bound by the decision of the majority.

This, however, doesn’t mean that individuals in civil society put
themselves under an obligation to obey the dictates of arbitrary
tyrants. The most controversial aspect of Locke’s Second Treatise at
the time of publication, and no doubt one of the reasons why he chose
to publish it anonymously, was his view that it can sometimes be
right for citizens to overthrow and replace their rulers.

REBELLION
The whole point of joining together to form a civil society is the
protection of life, liberty and property. When a ruthless government
or ruler oversteps its legitimate role and ceases to act for the public
good in these respects, then, Locke argues, it is acceptable for the
people to rise up and overthrow that government or ruler. The
government or ruler is given a position of trust; when that trust is
betrayed all obligation on the part of the people is dissolved. By failing
to act for the public good the government or ruler forfeits the power
which the people bestowed upon it by their social compact. This
follows from Locke’s belief that all legitimate government is
government by consent. To the accusation that this sounds like an
incitement to rebellion, Locke replies that it surely cannot be right
to defer to robbers and pirates: the implication being that those who
rule without the people’s consent and act contrary to the common
good are the equivalent of criminals and do not deserve to be obeyed.
On Locke’s account, no government or ruler has any right to absolute
power over its citizens. The limits on power are the limits of serving
the common good.

CRITICISMS OF SECOND TREATISE
OF GOVERNMENT

Role of God
One obvious criticism of Locke’s position is that it is heavily dependent
on the existence of the Christian, or at least the Old Testament, God.
The notion of a law of nature, which is fundamental to his theory of
government, is derived from orthodox Christian doctrine. Without
God’s existence we might expect the state of nature to be something
much closer to the state of war of everyone against everyone described
by Hobbes. Whilst atheism was a comparatively rare phenomenon
when Locke wrote his Treatises, it is a common position today. Many
people are convinced that there is no god, Christian or otherwise. For
such atheists Locke’s account will be unconvincing unless non-
theological premises can be found for it.

No consensus about laws of nature
Even Christians might have worries about Locke’s account of the laws
of nature. These are supposed to be God-given and readily discoverable
simply by reflecting on what it would be rational to do. But it is by
no means obvious that such laws exist. Locke assumes that they exist
and that they are easily discerned. Yet the range of incom patible
principles of action that various philosophers have claimed to discover
by reflection suggests that there is little agreement about what the
supposed laws of nature actually dictate. If there are no laws of nature,
or if there is serious confusion about what they are, then Locke’s
theory of government will founder.

Class bias?
Some of Locke’s critics have singled out his discussion of property
for special attention. They argue that it reveals him to have been
concerned to justify the status quo in relation to land ownership,
serving the interests of the property-owning classes at the expense
of those who had nothing to sell but their labour. There is some textual
support for this position, particularly when Locke comments that the
land which has been worked by his servant becomes his (rather than
his servant’s). Indeed, despite his insistence that in the state of nature
everyone is free and equal, the Second Treatise seems to be a
justification for extreme inequalities of property ownership.
