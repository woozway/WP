PLATO THE REPUBLIC

THE CAVE
Imagine a cave. Prisoners are chained facing its far wall. They’ve been
kept there all their lives and their heads are held fixed so that they
can’t see anything except the wall of the cave. Behind them there is
a fire and between the fire and their backs a road. Along the road
various people walk casting their shadows on the cave wall; some of
them carry models of animals which also cast shadows. The prisoners
inside the cave only ever see shadows. They believe the shadows are
the real things because they don’t know any better. But in fact they
never see real people.

Then one day one of the prisoners is released and allowed to look
towards the fire. At first he is completely dazzled by the flames, but
gradually he starts to discern the world around him. Then he is taken
out of the cave into the full light of the sun, which again dazzles
him. He slowly begins to realise the poverty of his former life: he
had always been satisfied with the world of shadows when behind
him lay the brightly lit real world in all its richness. Now as his eyes
acclimatise to the daylight he sees what his fellow prisoners have
missed and feels sorry for them. Eventually he becomes so used to
the light that he can even look directly at the sun.

Then he is taken back to his seat in the cave. His eyes are no longer
used to this shadowy existence. He can no longer make the fine
discriminations between shadows that his fellow prisoners find easy.
From their point of view his eyesight has been ruined by his journey
out of the cave. He has seen the real world; they remain content with
the world of superficial appearances and wouldn’t leave the cave even
if they could.

This parable of the prisoners in the cave occurs halfway through
Plato’s masterpiece, The Republic. It provides a memorable image of
his theory of Forms, his account of the nature of reality. According
to him the majority of humankind are, like the prisoners, content
with a world of mere appearance. Only philosophers make the journey
out of the cave and learn to experience things as they really are; only
they can have genuine knowledge. The world of everyday perception
is constantly changing and imperfect. But the world of the Forms to
which philosophers have access is unchanging and perfect. It can’t be
perceived with the five senses: it is only by means of thought that
anyone can experience the Forms.

PLATO AND SOCRATES
The life and death of his mentor, Socrates, was the main influence
on Plato’s philosophy. Socrates was a charismatic figure who
attracted a crowd of wealthy young Athenians around him. He did
not leave any writing but exerted his influence through his
conversations in the marketplace. He claimed not to have any doctrine
to teach, but rather, through a series of pointed questions, would
demonstrate how little those he talked to really knew about such
things as the nature of piety, justice, or morality. While Plato was
still a young man, Socrates was sentenced to death for corrupting
the youth of the city and failing to believe in its gods. Socrates
drank hemlock, the conventional method of execution for Athenian
citizens.

Plato gave Socrates a kind of afterlife in his dialogues. Yet the
character called Socrates in Plato’s work probably differs considerably
in his views from the real Socrates. Plato wrote as if he were
recording conversations which had actually occurred; but by the
time he came to write The Republic, Plato’s Socrates had become a
mouthpiece for Plato’s own views.

The Republic provides a mixture of Plato’s two characteristic
approaches to writing. In Book One, there is a conversation between
Socrates and some friends which could have been the first scene in
a play: we are told something of the setting and the reactions of the
different characters. But in later sections, although Plato continues
to write in dialogue form, the thrust of exposition is in Socrates’
voice, and the supporting cast simply agree with his pronouncements.

THRASYMACHUS AND GLAUCON
The main body of The Republic is a response to the challenges set by
Thrasymachus and Glaucon. Thrasymachus maintains that what goes
by the name of ‘justice’ is simply whatever happens to serve the
interests of the strongest. Power is all that makes something right.
Justice is simply a matter of obeying the self-serving rules set up by
the strongest. At the level of individual behaviour, injustice pays much
better than justice: those who help themselves to more than their fair
share are happier than those who are just.

Glaucon takes this further, suggesting that those who behave
justly only do so as a form of self-preservation. Anyone who, like
the mythical character Gyges, found a ring that made them invisible
would lose any incentive for behaving justly since they could
guarantee getting away with any crime, seduction or deception. He
imagines a situation in which a just man is thought by everyone
else to be unjust. He is tortured and executed: his life seems to
have nothing to be said in its favour. Compare this with the life
of a cunning wicked man who manages to seem just while being
completely unscrupulous whenever he can get away with it. He leads
a happy life, it seems, and is considered a model of respectability even
though beneath his disguise he is thoroughly evil. This suggests that
justice doesn’t pay, or at least that it doesn’t always pay. It also
suggests that if Socrates wants to defend the just life he will have to
show that the situation described isn’t the full story. In fact in the
rest of the book Socrates attempts to do precisely that; he seeks to
demonstrate that justice does pay, and that, besides, it is intrinsically
worthwhile. It is good both for its consequences and in itself.

INDIVIDUAL AND STATE
Although The Republic is usually thought of as a work of political
philosophy, and despite the fact that most of it is focused on the
question of how Plato’s utopian state should be run, the discussion
of the state is only introduced as a way of getting clearer about
individual morality. Plato’s main concern is to answer the question
‘What is justice and is it worth pursuing?’ ‘Justice’ is a slightly
strange word to use here, but it is the best translation of the Greek
word dikaiosune ¯: it means, roughly, doing the right thing. Plato’s
main concern is the question of what is the best way for a human
being to live. His reason for looking at the organisation of the
state at all is his belief that the state is equivalent to the individual
writ large; that the best way of proceeding is to study justice in the
state and then transfer our findings to the individual. Just as some-
one who is short-sighted finds it easier to read large letters so it is
easier to look at justice in the state than on the smaller scale of an
individual life.

DIVISION OF LABOUR
Human beings cannot easily live alone. There are many advantages
in co-operation and communal living. As soon as people group
together it makes sense to divide work according to different people’s
skills: it is better for a tool maker to make tools all the year round
and a farmer to farm than that the farmer stop his work to make new
tools when the old ones wear out. The tool maker will be more skilled
at tool making than the farmer. The same is true of all other
professions which involve skill: skill requires practice.

As the state grows and work becomes more specialised, the need
for a full-time army to defend the state from attack becomes apparent.
The Guardians of the state must, according to Plato, be strong and
courageous, like good guard dogs. But they must also have a
philosophical temperament. A significant part of The Republic is
taken up with Plato’s training schedule for the Guardians.

RULERS, AUXILIARIES AND WORKERS
Plato divides his class of Guardians into two: Rulers and Auxiliaries.
The Rulers are those who are to have the political power and who
make all the important decisions; the Auxiliaries help the Rulers
and provide defence against threats from outside. A third group, the
Workers, will, as their name suggests, work, providing the necessities
of life for all the citizens. Plato isn’t much interested in the lives of
the Workers: most of The Republic concentrates on the Guardians.

The Rulers are chosen as those who are most likely to devote their
lives to doing what they judge to be in the best interests of the society.
To weed out unsuitable candidates, Plato suggests that in the course
of their education potential Rulers should be given various tests to
see if they are likely to be bewitched by the pursuit of their own
pleasure: their reactions to temptation will be closely monitored and
only those who demonstrate complete devotion to the well-being of
the community will be chosen to rule. They will be very few in
number.

None of the Guardians will be allowed to own personal property,
and even their children will be treated in common. In fact Plato
provides a radical solution to the family: he wants to abolish it and
replace it with state nurseries in which children are looked after
unaware of who their parents are. This is supposed to increase loyalty
to the state since children brought up in this way won’t have confusing
loyalties to family members.

Even sexual intercourse is regulated: citizens are only allowed to
have sex at special festivals when they are paired off by lot – or at
least, that’s what the participants are led to believe. In fact the
Rulers fix the outcome of the mating lottery so that only those of
good breeding stock will be allowed to procreate. Thus Plato’s republic
has its own form of eugenics designed to produce strong and
courageous children. At birth all children are taken away from their
mothers to be reared by specially appointed officers. Children of
inferior Guardians and any ‘defective’ offspring of the Workers are
disposed of.

ROLE OF WOMEN
Not all of Plato’s proposals in The Republic are as offensive as these
plans for selective breeding and infanticide. Unlike most of his
contemporaries, he thought that women should be given the same
education as men, should be allowed to fight alongside them, and
become Guardians if they showed aptitude. It is true that he still
believed that men would surpass women at every activity. Even so,
his proposals were radical at a time when married middle-class women
were virtual prisoners in their own homes.

THE MYTH OF THE METALS
The success of the state depends upon its citizens’ loyalty to the land
and to each other. In order to assure this loyalty Plato suggests that
all classes of society be encouraged to believe a myth about their
origins. The ‘magnificent myth’ or ‘noble lie’, as it is sometimes
translated, is as follows. Everyone sprang from the earth fully formed:
memories of upbringing and education are just a dream. In fact all
citizens are siblings since they are all the children of Mother Earth.
This should make them loyal both to the land (their mother) and to
each other (their brothers and sisters).

The myth has another aspect. God, when he created each individual,
added metal to their composition. He added gold to the Rulers; silver
to the Auxiliaries; and bronze and iron to the Workers. God instructed
the Rulers to observe the mixture of metals in the characters of
children. If a child with bronze in his or her composition is born of
gold parents, then they must harden their hearts and consign him or
her to the life of a Worker; if a Worker’s child has gold or silver in
him or her, then the child must be brought up as a Ruler or Auxiliary
as appropriate. This myth is intended to produce not only loyalty,
but contentment with your station in life. The class that you belong
to is determined by factors outside your control.

THE JUST STATE AND THE JUST INDIVIDUAL
Because the ideal state he describes is perfect, Plato believes it must
possess the qualities of wisdom, courage, self-discipline and justice.
He takes it for granted that these are the four cardinal virtues of any
perfect state. Wisdom is due to the Rulers’ knowledge, which allows
them to make wise decisions for the benefit of the state; courage is
demonstrated by the Auxiliaries, whose training has made them brave
and fearless in defence of the state; self-discipline arises from the
harmony between the three classes, with the unruly desires of the
majority being held in check by the wise decisions of the Rulers; and
lastly, justice is evident in the state as a result of each person taking
care of his or her own business in the sense of doing what he or she
is naturally fitted for. Anyone who attempts social mobility is a
potential threat to the state’s stability.

The ideal state exhibits the four cardinal virtues because of its
division into three classes and because of the harmonious balance
between their assigned roles. Analogously, Plato insists, each
individual consists of three parts, and the qualities of wisdom, courage,
self-discipline and justice all depend on the harmonious interplay
between these parts of the individual.

THE THREE PARTS OF THE SOUL
The word ‘soul’ suggests something more spiritual than is appropriate:
although Plato believes in the immortality of the soul, what he writes
about the three parts of the soul in The Republic doesn’t turn on the
soul being separable from the body, or even on its being something
distinct from the body. His interest here is really in the psychology
of motivation. The three parts of the soul he identifies are Reason,
Spirit and Desire.

Reason corresponds to the role of the Rulers in the ideal state.
Like the Rulers, Reason can plan for the good of the whole entity:
unlike the other parts of the soul, it is not self-interested. Reason has
the capacity to make plans about how best to achieve certain ends;
but it also involves the love of truth.

Spirit is that part of the personality which provides emotional
motivation for action in the form of anger, indignation and the like.
When subject to the proper training Spirit is the source of bravery
and courage. Spirit corresponds to the role of the Auxiliaries.
Desire is the pure appetite for particular things such as food, drink
or sex. Desire can persist in direct opposition to Reason. Indeed the
occurrence of conflicts between what people want and what they
know is best for them is evidence Plato uses to support his distinction
between the three parts of the soul. Desire corresponds to the role of
the Workers.

The four virtues of wisdom, courage, self-discipline and justice can
all be found in individuals as well as in states: Plato explains these
virtues in terms of the parts of the soul. Someone who is wise makes
decisions based on the dominance of Reason; someone who is brave
gets the motivation to act in the face of danger from Spirit,
which acts as the ally of Reason; someone who has self-discipline
follows the dictates of Reason, keeping Desire under control. Most
importantly, someone who is just acts so that all the parts of the soul
are in harmony: each part functions in its appropriate role with
Reason in command. So justice in the individual is a kind of psychic
harmony. This is what makes it an intrinsically valuable condition.

PHILOSOPHER KINGS
Although Plato’s pretext for discussing justice in the state is in order
to illuminate questions about the individual, he is clearly also deeply
concerned with the utopian republic he has created. He addresses
the question of how such a political system could ever come about
and concludes that the only hope is to rest power in the hands of
philosophers. Plato defends this surprising suggestion with another
parable. Imagine a ship whose owner is short-sighted, a bit deaf and
more or less ignorant of seamanship. The crew quarrel about who
should take the helm of the ship. None of them have devoted any
time to the study of navigation and in fact they don’t believe it can
be taught. Factions compete to take control of the ship, and when
they do they help themselves to the goods on board, turning the
voyage into a kind of drunken pleasure cruise. None of them realise
that a navigator needs to study the weather and the position of the
stars. They think of anyone who acquires the relevant skills as a
useless star-gazer.

The state in its present form is like the ship lurching around in
the hands of the unskilled crew. Only in the hands of a skilled
navigator will it be kept under control: and the philosopher, despised
as he might be, is the only person in possession of the knowledge
required to steer the state. Plato’s theory of Forms explains why
philosophers are particularly well-equipped to rule.

THE THEORY OF FORMS
The parable of the cave with which I began this chapter illustrates in
a memorable way Plato’s picture of the human condition. Most of
humanity is content with mere appearance, the equivalent of the
flickering shadows on the wall of the cave. Philosophers, however,
since they love truth, seek knowledge of reality: they journey out of
the cave and get access to the Forms.

The theory of Forms, although put forward by the character
Socrates in The Republic, is generally recognised to be Plato’s own
contribution to philosophy. When people speak of Platonism they
usually mean this aspect of his work. To understand what Plato meant
by ‘Form’ it is easiest to consider one of his examples.

Many beds exist. Some are double, some single, some four-posted,
and so on. Yet there is something they share which makes them all
beds. What they share is a relation to an ideal bed, the Form of the
bed. This Form actually exists: it is the only real bed. All other beds
are imperfect copies of the Form of the bed. They belong to the world
of appearance, not of reality. Consequently we can only have genuine
knowledge of the Form of the bed: any information about actual
beds is opinion, not knowledge. The everyday world we inhabit is
constantly changing; the world of Forms is timeless and unchanging.
Philosophers, with their love of wisdom, gain access to the world of
Forms, and thus the possibility of knowledge, through thought;
perception restricts us to the flux of the world of appearance.

Though he does not spell out precisely which things in the world
have a corresponding Form, Plato does maintain that there is a Form
of the Good. It is the Good which is the ultimate focus of phil-
os ophers’ quest for knowledge. He uses the simile of the sun to
explain this idea. The sun makes sight possible and is the source of
growth; the Form of the Good allows the mind’s eye to ‘see’ and
understand the nature of reality. Without the illumination provided
by the Form of the Good, we are condemned to live in a twilight
world of appearance and opinion; in the light of the Good we can
glean knowledge of how to live.

EXAMPLES OF INJUSTICE
Having shown that a just state is one in which the different classes
fulfil their appropriate roles, and a just individual one in whom the
different motivations are in harmony, Plato turns to some examples
of injustice in the state and the individual. He considers four types
of unjust state and their corresponding personality type. The four
are timocracy, oligarchy, democracy and tyranny. A timocracy is a
state, such as Sparta, which is dominated by a drive for military
honour; in an oligarchy wealth is the sign of merit; a democracy
is a state which is ruled by the people as a whole; in a tyranny the
ruler has absolute power.

Again Plato exploits the alleged symmetry between the state and
the individual. For instance, in his discussion of democracy he claims
that state democracy ignores the principle of training to rule which
he has shown to be so essential to the just state. The only prerequisite
in a democratic ruler is that he professes to be the people’s friend.
The corresponding democratic individual, like the democratic state,
entertains a wide variety of pleasures, not distinguishing those which
are based on good desires from those which have their source in evil.
The result is psychic disharmony: the democratic individual does not
permit Reason to rule over inappropriate desires. Idle whims
dominate; injustice is inevitable.

AGAINST ART
In his account of the Guardians’ education Plato argues that various
kinds of poetry should be censored. Any writing which gives a false
impression of gods or heroes, or which when read out loud by students
will lead to an over-identification with unjust characters, is to be
banned. In Book Ten of The Republic he returns to the subject of
art and its place in an ideal society. He concentrates on mimetic art,
that is, art which is meant to represent reality. His conclusion is
that such art should have no place in his republic. There are two main
reasons for this. First, it can only ever be a copy of an appearance
and so tends to distance us from the world of the Forms. Second, it
appeals to the irrational part of our souls and so tends to disrupt the
psychic harmony necessary for justice.

To explain the first sort of criticism Plato takes the example of a
painter painting a bed. God made the Form of the bed; a carpenter
made a shadowy copy of that Form; an artist painted a copy of the
carpenter’s copy, doing the equivalent of holding up a mirror to what
was already an imperfect image of the one real bed. Consequently
the artist obstructs rather than aids our knowledge of reality. The
artist remains ignorant of the true nature of the bed and is content
with copying the appearance of a particular bed. Plato takes poets to
be doing more or less the same as the painter, and so extends his
disapproval to the art of poetry.

The work of mimetic artists is nevertheless seductive, as Plato
recognises. It does not appeal to reason, but to the lower parts of the
soul, an effect exacerbated by artists’ tendency to represent evil rather
than good impulses. Mimetic artists can lead the unwary away from
the path to knowledge. There is, then, no place for them in the
republic.

CRITICISMS OF THE REPUBLIC

State/individual analogy
Plato’s whole project in The Republic relies on there being a strong
analogy between justice in the state and justice in an individual.
If the analogy is weak, then any conclusions about justice for an
individual derived from conclusions about the just state will be
correspondingly weak. Plato treats it as obvious that his move from
state to individual is a legitimate one. However, it is at least worth
questioning whether or not this move is justified.

Only Rulers can be just
Furthermore, Plato’s theory seems to have the consequence that only
the Rulers can be just. After justice has been defined in terms of
psychic harmony and each class in the republic in terms of their
dominant source of motivation, it becomes clear that only those in
whom Reason rules supreme will be capable of acting justly. The
Rulers are the only class of people who are in this position. So it
seems to follow that only the Rulers are capable of justice. Plato might
not have seen this as a serious objection to his theory but rather as
an illuminating consequence; for most readers today, however, it
brings out the uncompromising elitism inherent in Plato’s thought.

Equivocates about ‘justice’
When Plato tells us that justice is really a kind of mental health in
which the three parts of the soul function harmoniously he seems to
have discarded the ordinary sense of ‘justice’. He seems to have
redefined the word arbitrarily to suit his purposes, or at the very least
to have used it in two different senses. Why would anyone want to
talk of ‘justice’ in this way?

Plato would no doubt respond to this criticism that his notion of
justice does bring out what we ordinarily mean by justice. Plato’s
just individual won’t steal or take more than his share because that
would involve Reason’s yielding to lower desires. However, this
seems to leave open the possibility that some people whom we might
be tempted to label ‘just’ on account of their behaviour would not
pass Plato’s test since their behaviour might stem from less than
harmonious psychic functioning. They might simply have a desire
to behave justly, but a very underdeveloped capacity to reason.

Involves deception
At several key points in his argument Plato advocates lying in order
to preserve loyalty to the state and to fellow citizens. For instance,
there is the so-called ‘noble lie’ of the myth of the metals; there
is also the lie about the mating lottery. Many people find this un -
acceptable. An ideal state should not be founded on deception. Plato,
however, seems unconcerned about this. His interest is in the end
result and the best way to achieve it, not in moral questions about
how this end result is achieved.

Theory of Forms is implausible
Plato’s theory of Forms provides an important foundation for his
arguments about the ideal republic. Yet it has little intuitive
plausibility for most philosophers today. Perhaps hardest to stomach
is the notion that the Forms actually exist and are the reality of which
the observed world is simply a shadowy copy.

If we jettison the theory of Forms, then the metaphysical under -
pinning of many of Plato’s proposals would be removed. For instance,
without the notion that philosophers are particularly good at gaining
knowledge of reality, there would be no obvious justification for
putting them in charge of the ideal state. Nor would there be an
obvious reason for banning the mimetic arts from the state.

Justifies totalitarianism
However, perhaps the most significant criticism of Plato’s Republic
is that it provides a recipe for totalitarianism. With its plan for
eugenics, its ‘noble lie’, its outlawing of the family and its censorship
of art, the state intrudes into every area of life. Individuals in Plato’s
world must be subservient to the requirements of the state and are
expected to sacrifice every element of personal freedom to this end.
Those of us who value individual liberty and freedom of choice find
Plato’s vision a decidedly unattractive one.
