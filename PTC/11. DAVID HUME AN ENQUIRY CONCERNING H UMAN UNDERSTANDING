DAVID HUME AN
ENQUIRY CONCERNING
HUMAN
UNDERSTANDING

Hume was a sceptic. But, unlike some ancient Greek sceptics, he did
not advocate suspending judgement on every issue. He believed that
nature had equipped us well for life, and that at a certain point instinct
and feeling take over and philosophical doubts, rightly, seem absurd.
Hume questioned the traditional view that human beings are
essentially rational. He argued that the role of reason in human life
is very limited, far more limited than most previous philosophers had
supposed.

The rigour and originality of his work are startling, but particularly
so in the light of the fact that he had worked out and published most
of his philosophical ideas by the time he was 25 years old. His first
book, A Treatise of Human Nature, received far less attention than
he had hoped; he described it as having fallen ‘dead-born from the
press’. The Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding is a rewritten
and extended version of the Treatise intended to make its content
more accessible. He felt that readers had been put off by his style of
expression, but was, for the most part, happy with the content of the
Treatise. It is difficult to imagine a present-day philos opher going to
such lengths for the sake of the reader.

Like Locke, Hume is usually described as an empiricist; like Locke
he believes that the entire contents of the mind are ultimately
derived from experience. Hume is an empiricist, not just in terms of
his conclusions about the origins of our thoughts, but also in his
methodology. Rather than attempting to deduce from first principles
what human beings must be like, he relies on observation, usually
in the form of introspection. His aim is to produce a coherent scientific
view of humanity.

Many of his views on the mind and its relation to the world are
influenced by Locke’s Essay Concerning Human Understanding, but
Hume took them a stage further. One aspect of his philosophy which
is very similar to Locke’s is his reliance on the theory of ideas. Hume,
however, introduced several new terms. Where Locke just used the
word ‘idea’, Hume talks of ‘perceptions’, ‘impressions’ and ‘ideas’.

THE ORIGIN OF IDEAS
Hume uses the word ‘perception’ for any contents of experience:
the equivalent of Locke’s ‘idea’. Perceptions occur when we are
seeing, feeling, remembering, imagining and so on: a much wider
range of mental activity than is covered by our present-day use of
the word. For Hume perceptions are of two basic kinds: impressions
and ideas.

Impressions are the experiences we get when we see, feel, love,
hate, desire or will anything. Hume describes them as more ‘lively’
than ideas, by which he seems to mean that they are clearer and
more detailed. Ideas are copies of impressions; they are the objects
of our thought when we recollect our experience or exercise our
imagination.

So, for example, I now have an idea of my pen moving across my
page and of someone turning the pages of a book behind me in the
library. I also have an impression of the texture of the paper
underneath my hand. These sensory experiences are vivid: it would
be difficult to convince me that I am simply remembering previous
experiences, or that I am dreaming. Later, when I type these lines
into my computer, I will no doubt think back to this moment and
recollect my impressions. Then I will be having ideas rather than
impressions, ideas which won’t have the same vividness (or ‘liveliness’
in Hume’s terminology) as do the present sensory impressions of
which they are copies.

Hume recasts Locke’s assertion that there are no innate ideas
as all our ideas are copies of impressions. In other words, it is
im possible for us to have an idea of something which we have not
first experienced as an impression.

How, then, would Hume cope with my ability to imagine a golden
mountain even though I have never seen one and so never had
an impression of one? His answer relies on a distinction between
simple and complex ideas. Simple ideas are all derived from simple
impressions. They are ideas of such things as colours and shape, ideas
which cannot be broken down into composite parts. Complex ideas
are combinations of simple ideas. So, my idea of a golden mountain
is just a complex idea composed of the simpler ideas of ‘a mountain’
and of ‘golden’. And these simple ideas are ultimately derived from
my experience of mountains and of golden things.

Support for the belief that all our ideas derive from earlier
impressions comes from the suggestion that any of our ideas can on
reflection be broken down into its component parts which can then
be seen to have come from impressions. Further support for this
account comes from the observation that a man who had been
completely blind from birth would be incapable of having an idea of
the colour red since he would have had no visual impression of the
colour. Similarly, and more contentiously, Hume declares that
someone who was selfish wouldn’t be able to form an idea of feelings
of generosity.

However, though Hume thinks that, for the most part, his
refinement of Locke’s theory of ideas will be able to explain the origin
of any particular idea, he does nevertheless identify an exception to
this principle. The exception is the missing shade of blue. Someone
who has seen a wide range of shades of blue may never have had an
impression of one particular shade. Despite this, he can form an idea
of this missing shade of blue. According to Hume’s theory this should
be impossible since he will have had no simple impression to which
the idea of the colour corresponds. However, he is not unduly worried
about this apparent counterexample because it is so exceptional and
hence he does not refine his basic principles in the light of it.

THE ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS
Hume suggests three types of link between ideas. These provide an
explanation of how it is that we move from one thought to another.
They are: resemblance, contiguity, and cause and effect.

If two things resemble each other, then our thought of one
naturally leads us to thoughts of the other. So, for example, when I
look at a picture of my daughter, my thoughts are naturally led to
my daughter herself. If two things are contiguous in time or place,
that is, if they occur close to one another, then, similarly, an idea of
one will lead to an idea of the other. So, if I think about my kitchen,
then my thought will move easily to the adjoining living room because
they are close together. Lastly, if two things are related because one
is the cause of the other, then thoughts about the cause will lead us
to thoughts about the effect. For instance, if I have an idea of stubbing
my toe, then, as this is the cause of pain, my thoughts will move
easily to ideas of pain.

Armed with his distinction between ideas and impressions and the
three principles of the association of ideas, Hume believes he can
account for all the workings of our conscious minds.

CAUSATION
One billiard ball strikes another and causes it to move. That is what
we see and that is how we describe it. But what does it mean to say
that one thing causes another? This is a fundamental question for
Hume since, as he points out, all our thinking about matters of fact
involves arguing from known causes to expected effects, or from
perceived effects to probable causes. For instance, if I found a watch
on a desert island I would assume that the cause of its being there
was that someone had once left it on the island. If I heard a voice
speaking in the dark I would assume there was someone there. These
are examples of reasoning from effects to their causes. When I see
one billiard ball rolling towards another, I anticipate its effect when
it makes contact, thus reasoning from cause to probable effect. Scienti -
fic reasoning too is based on reasoning about cause and effect.

Yet, rather than take the relations between cause and effect for
granted, as we inevitably do most of the time, Hume questions where
we get our idea of it from. No matter how many times I watch
collisions of billiard balls, I will not be able to discern anything in
the first ball that means that the second ball must move in a certain
direction. Hume believes that the source of all our knowledge about
causal relations is experience. Until we have observed two billiard
balls colliding (or at least some similar event), we will have no idea
about what will happen. Adam, the first man, wouldn’t have been
able to tell that the effect of submerging his head in water would be
that he would drown. Until he had experience of water he would not
have had any way of knowing its effects.

Once Adam learnt something about the effects of water, he would
have predicted that it would continue to behave in the same way.
This type of reasoning about the future based on past regularities is
known as induction. Similar causes produce similar effects, and we
cannot help assuming that in this respect the future will be like the
past. However, it is at this point that the so-called problem of induction
becomes apparent. Our justification for assuming that the future will
be like the past is flimsy. Yet it is the basis of all our thought. I can’t
use the fact that the assumption of regularity in nature has served
me well in the past as a justification of inductive reasoning about
the future: that would be a viciously circular argument using
induction to justify induction. The fact is that it is just a habit that
human beings have, albeit one that, on the whole, serves us well.
It is custom and habit that guide us through life, not our powers of
reason.

Our knowledge of cause and effect, when closely examined,
amounts to an assumption that if two things are constantly found
together with one occurring prior to the other then we will call the
first a cause of the second the effect. Beyond what Hume calls ‘constant
conjunction’ and priority in time of cause to effect, there is no
necessary connection between a cause and its effect. It’s not that Hume
wants us to abandon our trust in relations between causes and effects:
that would be impossible for us anyway. Rather he is demonstrating
how little our behaviour is dependent on reason, and how much on
our inherited nature and habits.

FREE WILL
Traditionally human free will has been thought to be incompatible
with all our actions being caused. If every human action is simply
the effect of some prior cause, then our sense of having control over
our actions is misleading. Free will on this view is just an illusion.
And without free will there can be no room for moral responsibility
and culpability: if all our actions are caused and are thus outside our
control, it cannot be appropriate to praise or blame us for them.

Hume opposed this way of thinking, arguing both that all our
actions are in some sense caused and that we have free will. This view
is usually known as compatibilism. Hume’s argument is somewhat
sketchy. He stresses that human beings are just as much subject to
natural laws as is physical matter. For instance, similar motives tend
to produce similar actions: there is the same sort of constant
conjunction of cause and effect found in the human world as in
the material one. Someone who leaves a purse full of gold on the
pavement at Charing Cross would no more expect to find it there
when he returns than he would expect it to sprout wings and fly.
There is a predictable regularity in human behaviour, and this
is evident throughout history and in every nation. This regularity in
human nature in no way undermines the possibility of each of us
choosing what we will do. There is, then, for Hume no contradiction
involved between our actions being predictable and their being freely
chosen.

Hume considers the suggestion that his account of human
behaviour has the consequence that either none of our actions are
wrong, since they can be traced back to God as their cause; or else
our evil actions ultimately spring from God. With a certain amount
of irony Hume rejects both options as obviously absurd and suggests
that the answer to this problem is beyond the scope of his philosophy.
However, most of his readers would have appreciated that he was
presenting a thinly concealed attack on the notion of God. If there is
no God, or if God is not as the theologians describe him, then there
may be no problem about attributing responsibility for evil human
actions.

His scepticism about various arguments for the existence of God
continues in two important chapters, one on the so-called Argument
from Design, and the other on miracles. These chapters were not
included in the Treatise. They were considered extremely controver-
sial when published in the Enquiry Concerning Human Under-
standing, and the discussion of miracles was the subject of many
pamphlets from enraged theologians. As the chapter on the Argu-
ment from Design overlaps substantially with the argument in his
Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion (the subject of the next
chapter in this book), I will not discuss it here.

MIRACLES
The basic principle that Hume asks us to accept is that a wise person
will always proportion his or her belief to the evidence available on
any issue. This uncontroversial principle is the starting point for his
dismissal of the suggestion that we should believe sincere accounts
by those who claim to have witnessed miracles.

Hume is very clear about what a miracle is. It is a transgression
of a law of nature, and one which is usually presumed to have been
caused by God. Miracles should not be confused with merely
extraordinary occurrences. For example, it would be a miracle if I
suddenly began to hover two feet above the ground with no support
and nothing physically keeping me there. It would be merely extra-
ordinary if I were to win the lottery. Hovering above the ground
involves defying the established laws of physics; winning the lottery
is no miracle (unless, perhaps, I were to win it without holding a
ticket): it is just a relatively unlikely occurrence given the massive
odds against its happening to me.

Many people claim to have witnessed miracles in the above sense.
However, Hume argues that we should never believe their testimony
unless it would be more miraculous that they were lying or deceived
than that the miracle occurred. We should always believe the lesser
miracle, and always prefer an explanation that relies on the merely
extraordinary to one which is based on the occurrence of something
miraculous. This is the sensible policy of someone who proportions
belief to the available evidence.

Hume suggests that the evidence should always incline us to
believe that no miracle has happened. This is because any law of nature
has been confirmed by numerous observations of it holding. Given
the principle of believing in proportion to the available evidence,
Hume maintains that particular eye-witness testimony of miracles is
insufficient evidence on which to base the view that a law of nature
has been transgressed. His position is bolstered by facts of psychology
such as that human beings get a great deal of pleasure from emotions
of amazement and wonder, the kinds of emotions that are typically
aroused by reports of miracles. This can be a stimulus to self-deception
about whether what you are witnessing is a miracle or not. Most of
those who claim to have witnessed miracles stand to gain a great deal:
they are likely to be given special treatment and to be thought of as
specially chosen by God. This can act as a strong incentive to deceive
either others or themselves.

All these factors combine to make it much more likely in any
particular case that a miracle didn’t take place than that it did. Hume
does not rule out the logical possibility of miracles occurring; but he
does suggest that a wise person should never believe a report of one.

HUME’S FORK
Hume ends his Enquiry with a forceful condemnation of philo sophical
writing which does not meet up to his strict empirical principles. Of
any book he asks two questions. The dichotomy set up by these two
questions has come to be known as Hume’s Fork. The two questions
are: first, does it contain any abstract reasoning of the sort found in
mathematics or geometry? If not, does it contain any factual
statements of a kind that can be observed or tested? If neither, he
declares, ‘Commit it then to the flames; for it can contain nothing
but sophistry and illusion.’

CRITICISMS OF AN ENQUIRY CONCERNING
HUMAN UNDERSTANDING

Presupposes theory of ideas
Hume’s philosophy, especially his account of induction, has been
remarkably resilient in the face of criticism. However, one part of it
which has been rejected by almost all present-day philosophers is the
theory of ideas. Hume did not really argue for this account of the
mind, but rather took it for granted and refined it. Yet, there are
numerous difficulties which arise for this sort of representative theory,
some of which were mentioned in the chapter on Locke’s Essay, such
as the homunculus problem.

The missing shade of blue presents a
counterexample
As we have seen, Hume does consider the example of the missing
shade of blue as a possible counterexample to his view that all our
ideas come from prior impressions, but he dismisses it as an excep-
tional case. However, the same sort of example could be constructed
for any of the five senses: the missing note in a musical scale, the
missing taste between two known tastes, the missing texture,
the missing smell that falls between two perfumes. This sort of
example, if taken seriously, presents a greater threat to Hume’s
account of the mind than he seems to realise.

There are, however, at least two ways in which Hume might
respond to this sort of criticism. First, he could simply deny the
possibility of having an idea of the missing shade of blue (or any of
its equivalents). He chose not to do this. Second, he might consider
the idea of the missing shade a complex idea, perhaps a combination
of the ideas of blue and of the relation of being lighter than. However,
because of a commitment to the supposition that ideas of colours are
always simple ideas, he chooses not to do this either.

GLOSSARY
compatibilism: the belief that all our actions have prior causes and
  yet that we do genuinely have free will and not just an illusion of
  it.
constant conjunction: when two or more things are always found

idea: a copy of an impression. Notice that Hume’s use of this term
  is more restricted than Locke’s.
impression: any direct perception, including of our own feelings.
  Impressions are, according to Hume, more vivid (‘lively’) than the
  ideas they give rise to.

  use induction when you predict the future on the basis of what
  has happened in the past.
miracle: a transgression of a law of nature attributed to God’s
