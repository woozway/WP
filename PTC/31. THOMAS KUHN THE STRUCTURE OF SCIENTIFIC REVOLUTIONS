THOMAS KUHN
THE STRUCTURE OF
SCIENTIFIC
REVOLUTIONS

Science is the empirical study of the world. Its peculiar combination
of theory and observation is the basis of advances in medicine,
computing, transport and many other aspects of our lives. It has
allowed us to send astronauts into space. The rise of science in the
seventeenth century was one of the most significant developments
in the history of humanity. But does science progress by the gradual
accumulation of knowledge, with each generation of scientists refining
their understanding of the world to give a more accurate picture of
reality? Up until the early 1960s this was the dominant view amongst
philosophers of science. Thomas Kuhn, however, felt that it gave a
misleading picture of how science actually functioned. The process is
less gradual than had been appreciated, and might not even get closer
to the truth. There are, he argued, alternating periods of normal
science followed by periods of crisis and then, often though not
inevitably, scientific revolution. In normal science, scientists agree
about the rules, methods and standards for scientific research, and
there is a great deal of consensus about how to do research in any
particular area; in periods of revolution these rules and expectations
are transformed. The monopoly on method and explanation dissolves
and alternative assumptions and methodologies come to the fore. That
is the main message of Kuhn’s influential study of the history of
science, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962), a book which
has had a deep influence on the philosophy of science, and which has
sold well over a million copies. Kuhn’s approach was grounded in
historical research, but is essentially philosophical: he presents a
theoretical account of how scientists work, and how they change their
outlook fundamentally in the light of what he labels a new paradigm.
He also gives a broader account of how understanding changes
following what he calls a paradigm shift. Kuhn began his career as a
physicist before switching his attention to the history of science and
to philosophical issues that emerge from that, and his writing is rich
in scientific examples. At heart, though, it is a philosophical account
because of the very general claims he makes about the nature of
scientific research.

WHAT KUHN WAS ARGUING AGAINST
Many philosophers and historians of science writing before Kuhn
published his book believed that science progressed in a straight-
forward linear way, through the addition of new information that in
turn led to new discoveries. Each brilliant scientist, they thought,
contributed something more to the stock of science, and the scientific
community’s knowledge increased as a result. Science, according to
this account, is piecemeal, with successive generations adding more,
bit by bit, to human understanding. The philosopher Karl Popper
had given a more sophisticated account based on the notion that
rather than trying to prove scientific hypotheses to be true, something
which was logically impossible to achieve if the hypotheses were
expressed as inductive generalisations, scientists aim to refute them
with counter-evidence. Popper described progression in science as a
series of bold conjectures and refutations that allowed scientists to
get a better picture of the world. Science advanced, he believed,
by the successive refutation of more refined empirical hypotheses.
Kuhn rejected these accounts of what he called ‘development-by-
accumulation’ in favour of his model of successive waves of normal
science followed by intellectual crisis and subsequent revolution. For
Kuhn, science didn’t follow a completely logical process of refinement,
but rather was best described in sociological terms, focusing on
communities of scientists, their patterns of beliefs and how they
behaved.

NORMAL SCIENCE AND REVOLUTIONS
According to Kuhn, much of the time scientists are doing normal
science. This is science within an existing framework accepted by the
scientific community. The limits of good scientific practice are set by
consensus: during phases of normal science there is general agreement
about how scientists working in a particular area should conduct their
research, the sorts of methods and techniques that are appropriate
and the language in which to describe it. There is, in such periods,
little dispute about what constitutes good science. Researchers also
agree about how to interpret results. Normal science doesn’t aim at
or achieve radical originality, but is, rather, a form of puzzle-solving
within a set of parameters set by the prevailing scientific outlook.
Scientists working within a phase of normal science tend to discover
more or less what they expect to discover; it is essentially a kind of
‘mopping up’ work in the light of the paradigm rather than an attempt
to challenge the paradigm itself.

So, for example, scientists who worked within the Ptolemaic
paradigm in which it was taken for granted that the Earth was the
centre of the universe, carried on their research within a framework
set by that assumption, interpreting any new astronomical data
through the filter provided by that view. Any apparently discrepant
readings were for the most part dismissed as inaccurate measure-
ments: they were explained away rather than seen as challenges to
the sci entific status quo. The Ptolemaic system worked very well
at predicting observations since it gives a very good approximation
of planetary positions relative to each other. But there were, never-
theless, an increasing number of anomalous observations, observations
which couldn’t be explained on the basis of Ptolemaic assumptions,
particularly in relation to equinoxes.

Gradually the best astronomers began to realise the shortcomings
of the existing paradigm, creating an intellectual crisis and a loss of
confidence in the methods and conclusions drawn from research. This
wasn’t inevitable, since normal science typically generates anomalous
results in need of an explanation. But at a certain point in history,
the anomalies stack up in a way that throws existing science into
crisis. Things could have gone in one of several directions at this
point. Scientists might have found a way of explaining the anomalous
results as not really anomalous – that is, they might have been able
to accommodate them within the prevailing paradigm. Or else, as
sometimes happens, they might simply have noted the anomalies
and focused their energies on other issues, coming back to the anom-
alous findings at a later date. But in fact what happened was that
the anomalous observations triggered an attempt to find a better
explan ation. Copernicus, amongst others, recognised that some obser -
vations couldn’t be explained as errors and sought a way out of this
intellectual turmoil, casting around for alternative explanations and
paradigms. He came to see that there was a better explanation of the
available data, one based on a radically different assumption, namely
that the Sun not the Earth was the centre of the universe. This
eventually, despite the best efforts of the Catholic Church, became
the new paradigm within which normal science could once again
take place. The so-called Copernican Revolution transformed human
under standing of the planets and our relation to them, and the belief
that the Earth was the centre of the universe was no longer respectable.
Astronomy had to readjust, and begin a new period of normal science.
A similar and equally far-reaching paradigm shift occurred with
Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection, when previous
established ways of exploring plants and animals were overturned
and a new understanding of the biological world was made possible
with a corresponding agenda for normal scientists working in the wake
of Darwin’s theory.

PARADIGM SHIFTS TRANSFORM WHAT CAN BE
OBSERVED
Such paradigm changes don’t just jolt scientists out of their
complacency, but can, Kuhn believed, create new ways of seeing. For
example, again from the history of astronomy, William Herschel
discovered the planet Uranus in the eighteenth century. But on at
least seventeen different occasions prior to that astronomers had seen
a star in the position we now know to be occupied by Uranus. Their
existing framework, however, did not allow them to see that object
as a planet. To a great degree their expectations influenced what
they saw and they misjudged what and how far away it was. Herschel
made more detailed observations, but even he initially thought he
was observing a comet rather than a previously unrecognised planet.
Once astronomers came to realise that this was a planet, they
experienced a shift of vision that made it possible for them to discover
a range of minor planets in subsequent years. Before the paradigm
shift that allowed astronomers to recognise that there might be
more planets, every new observation was explained in other ways;
afterwards it was possible to see the solar system differently and
recognise further planets for what they were. They saw the evidence
much earlier than this, but failed to see planets – instead they saw
comets or distant stars. Revised expectations allowed Herschel and
his successors to see new planets for the first time even though
evidence for their presence had been visible for many years. This,
Kuhn believes, was a transformation in seeing. It is what is sometimes
called a Gestalt shift in perception – as, for example, when someone
presented with a playing card that consists of the Five of Hearts with
the hearts painted in black instead of red may not be able to see this
as anything but the Five of Hearts, because of expectations about the
range of card types that might be displayed. Once he or she realises
that it is a black Five of Hearts, what he sees changes dramatically,
although in terms of what reaches his retina it is precisely the same.
Wittgenstein used the famous duck-rabbit figure to make the same
point (see p. 266).

Incommensurability of competing paradigms
An important and highly controversial aspect of Kuhn’s approach to
the history of scientific revolution was his claim that different
scientific world views were incommensurable; that is, there was no
basis for comparing them – no common currency, as it were, with
which to measure them. A consequence of this view was that it would
not be possible to say that one theory was an improvement on another.
This seemed to threaten the idea that paradigm shifts represent
progress. It seemed to imply that they were simply different from
each other, and, because they typically redefined the terms in which
science was discussed, defied any meaningful comparison one with
another.

CRITICISMS OF THE STRUCTURE OF SCIENTIFIC
REVOLUTIONS

It is a form of relativism
Kuhn’s theory has often been seen as a kind of relativism. The value
of a scientific theory for Kuhn seems to be determined by how
communities of scientists rate it, rather than on the question of
whether it adequately describes the world, or at least is an improve-
ment on earlier descriptions of the world. The incommensurability
of different paradigms entails that there are no objective standards
making one paradigm better than another. This has the unfortunate
consequence that it leaves the various paradigms on a par even when
they have been superseded. There is no independent world against
which to check scientific results since the meaning of the explana-
tions of the world is given by the paradigm itself. New paradigms
are certainly different from the ones they replace, and deal with
anomalous evidence that was a problem in the earlier paradigms, but
they aren’t necessarily any closer to the truth about how the world
is. Indeed Kuhn questioned whether the idea of objective truth makes
sense.

Kuhn didn’t fully accept these sorts of challenges to his account
as criticisms, and has outlined criteria for a good scientific theory
such as accuracy, consistency, broadness of scope, simplicity and
fruitfulness. But some commentators still argue that much of what
he says leads inevitably towards an unattractive kind of relativism
with the result that deciding between competing paradigms reduces
to little more than a matter of group psychology. Some have even
gone so far as to claim that it turns science into an irrational activity
and has as a result damaged the reputation of science as compared to
other ways of attempting to understand the world.

GLOSSARY
anomalous observations: scientific data that does not sit easily within
  the existing paradigm.
Copernican revolution: the recognition that the Sun rather than the
  Earth was the centre of the universe – a rejection of the Ptolemaic
  world view.
Gestalt shift: a change in what is seen, despite no change in the
  stimulus – the result of a different way of organising visual data
  as when someone looking at the figure of a duck-rabbit shifts from
  seeing it as a drawing of a duck to the position of seeing it as a
  rabbit.
incommensurable: if two theories are incommensurable there is no
  objective way of measuring one against the other; no common
  currency, as it were.
normal science: this is Kuhn’s term for what most scientists do most
  of the time, namely solve puzzles within an established scientific
  paradigm, using more or less agreed methods and terms to describe
  their results.
paradigm shift: Kuhn’s term for the dramatic revolution brought about
  after a period of scientific crisis, when a new set of agreed methods,
  assumptions and terms is used by a community of scientists.
Ptolemaic system: the view that the Earth was the centre of the
  Universe.
relativism: the idea that there are no objective values, but rather that
  they are relative to a particular society or group. Kuhn is often
  accused of relativism because his theory seems to imply that
  different scientific paradigms are incommensurable and can only
  be described in relation to the scientific community’s assumptions
  and practices.
