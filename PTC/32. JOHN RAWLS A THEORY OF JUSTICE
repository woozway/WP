JOHN RAWLS A THEORY
OF JUSTICE

What kind of a society would you choose to live in if you didn’t
know the position you would occupy within it? John Rawls’ A
Theory of Justice provides the principles for constructing a fair and
just society by imagining a reasonable person’s response to this
question. The book, first published in 1971, transformed political
philosophy. It rejuvenated the social contract tradition established by
Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau. Though a complex and in places rather
dry book, it is one of the most widely read works of political
philosophy of the twentieth century. Its most distinctive aspect is its
use of the notion of the ‘original position’ to arrive at conclusions
about fairness and justice and how we should achieve them in our
social institutions.

THE ORIGINAL POSITION
If you were to choose the principles which should govern the best
possible society you might be biased in various ways towards your
own class, profession, sexual orientation, and so on. Rawls’ way
around this is to set up a thought experiment, a hypothetical situation
in which all the facts about your self, and your particular desires, are
hidden from you behind a veil of ignorance. You have to imagine
not knowing whether or not you have a job, what sex you are,
whether you have a family, where you live, how intelligent you
are, whether you are an optimist, a pessimist, a drug addict. Yet at
the same time you have a good grasp of politics and economics, the
basis of social organisation and the laws of human psychology. You
know that there are basic goods required for almost any lifestyle, and
these include certain freedoms, opportunity, income and self-respect.
Rawls calls this situation of ignorance about your own place in society
‘the original position’.

In this hypothetical state of the original position, which prin-
ciples would it be rational for someone to adopt for the organisation
of society? The idea of asking this question is to eliminate all the
non-relevant features of our actual lives which otherwise tend to
intrude in our assessment of what sort of society there should be.
Rawls assumes that principles rationally chosen under the conditions
of the original position would have a special claim to being just ones,
and that, other things being equal, we should adopt them.

The principles which emerge from this process should not be
controversial since if we have carried out the thought experiment
effectively, there should be no difference between any individuals
engaging in it. This is because in the original position all the elements
that distinguish us one from another should have been removed. The
principles then, should be ones on which rational participants would
agree. Carrying out this thought experiment, Rawls comes up with
two basic principles, one concerned with liberty, the other with the
just distribution of goods. These principles embody his basic political
conclusions which are liberal and egalitarian.

Unlike some social contract theorists Rawls is not saying that we
must all have implicitly agreed to these principles; rather he uses the
thought experiment of the original position as a way of generating
basic principles for the ordering of a just society and then compares
these with pre-existing intuitions in order to make fine tunings.
Rawls believes that the principles for ordering society that emerge
together merit the name ‘justice as fairness’ since they have been
arrived at by a rational and impartial process. The first of the two
principles thus generated is the liberty principle.

THE LIBERTY PRINCIPLE
The liberty principle states that ‘Each person is to have an equal right
to the most extensive total system of equal basic liberties compatible
with a similar system of liberty for all.’ In other words, choosing
behind a veil of ignorance a rational person would want everyone
in the society to have the same right to basic liberties as anyone
else. Otherwise that person might end up a victim of discrimination.
For example, liberty of conscience, freedom to entertain whatever
religious or secular beliefs you may find convincing, is a basic freedom
that the state is not justified in curtailing. Only when your actions
threaten others’ liberties would state intervention be justified, since
your liberty in this respect would not then be compatible with equal
liberty for everyone else. Even the intolerant have a right to liberty
up to the point at which they endanger the equal liberty of others.
The rule of law is necessary to guarantee the various liberties which
each member of a society has a right to.

Rawls stipulates that the principles he puts forward as the rational
choices of anyone in the original position are ordered lexically. What
this means is that they are ranked in such a way that the first principle
has to be satisfied before considering the second; the second before
moving on to the third and so on. Here this means that the right to
equal liberty is the most basic principle in his theory, and always
takes priority. The demands of this principle must be met first, and
are more important than the demands of the second principle. Rawls’
picture of a just society is, then, one in which a right to equal liberty
for all is upheld and enforced by law.

THE FAIR EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY
PRINCIPLE AND THE DIFFERENCE PRINCIPLE
Rawls’ second principle, one concerned with the just distribution of
primary goods, really consists of two principles: the fair equality of
opportunity principle and the difference principle. As a whole, this
second principle has lexical priority over any principles of efficiency.
What this means is that justice is more important than utility.

The fair equality of opportunity principle states that any social
or economic inequalities associated with particular offices or jobs
can only exist if these offices or jobs are open to everyone under
conditions of fair equality of opportunity. No one should be excluded
from, for instance, the best-paid jobs, on non-relevant grounds
such as sexual orientation or race. For Rawls equality of opportunity
is more than mere anti-discrimination. It includes, for example,
provision of education to allow all people to develop their talents. The
equality of opportunity principle takes lexical priority over the other
part of Rawls’ second principle, the difference principle.

The difference principle insists that any social or economic
inequalities should only be tolerated on condition that they bring the
greatest benefits to the most disadvantaged members of society. This
is an implementation of a strategy known as ‘maximin’. Maximin is
short for ‘maximise the minimum’, which means choose the option
which gives the best deal for the worst case. This is probably easier
to follow if we take the example of fair wages in a just society.
Imagine two situations. In the first, most people earn a high wage,
but ten per cent of the population can barely earn enough to survive.
In the second case, although the average standard of living is far
lower, the worst off ten per cent of the population have a reasonable
standard of living. For someone choosing in the original position,
Rawls claims, the second of the two situations is preferable because
it guarantees that everyone in the society will be achieving a
reasonable standard of living: the worst off aren’t that badly off. In
the first case, however, although there is a good chance of ending up
quite well off, there is also a significant risk of being on a wage that
barely allows you to survive. Adopting the maximin strategy, we
should minimise the worst risks, and so should opt for the second
case. It just isn’t worth the gamble to risk living a life in abject poverty.

CRITICISMS OF A THEORY OF JUSTICE

The original position
A major criticism of the notion of the original position is that it is
psychologically impossible to rid yourself of the knowledge of who
and what you are, even in a thought experiment. Inevitably your
prejudices evade the censor. Some critics of Rawls’ approach have
claimed that all Rawls has really done with the thought experiment
of the original position is confirmed his pre-existing liberal prejudices
and given them the aura of rationally chosen principles. It is unrealistic
to think that you can simply imagine away what you know and what
is so central to your individual existence.

In Rawls’ defence it might be argued that all this shows is the
difficulty of using the thought experiment effectively. It may yet be
the best device we have for generating principles for ordering society,
even if, because of features of human psychology, it is likely to be
imperfect in many respects. Rawls never claimed that his method was
infallible. But it is easy to see that it could eliminate some biased
principles as obvious non-starters.

Nevertheless, the original position has built into it some basic
assumptions. Rawls derives principles from it that present a vision
of a liberal, tolerant society within which people can live side by side
and pursue their own conception of what is good and right. The way
the thought experiment is set up gives a high priority to autonomy,
our capacity to make decisions for ourselves about how our lives
should be led. Those from cultural or religious traditions which put
a higher emphasis on hierarchy, tradition and obedience might see
little reason for engaging in the thought experiment of the original
position since it has this built-in bias towards a liberal and Kantian
conception of what it is to be a rational moral agent.

Utilitarian objection
Utilitarians might object to Rawls’ principles on the grounds that they
don’t necessarily maximise happiness. Utilitarians believe that the
morally right action in any circumstance is the one that is most likely
to produce the maximum amount of happiness. One of Rawls’ main
aims in writing A Theory of Justice was to develop a coherent
alternative to this sort of utilitarian calculation. Defending a range
of rights to freedom, and in particular implementing the difference
principle, is unlikely to maximise happiness. A direct consequence of
insisting that the only grounds for inequalities are that they benefit
the worst off is that many social solutions which produce a far greater
total or aggregate happiness will be ruled out.

Rawls’ response to utilitarian approaches to society is that since
you do not know what position in society you will occupy when
you choose in the original position, the rational approach is to
eliminate any risk of your leading an unpleasant life. Utilitarianism,
at least in its simplest forms, doesn’t safeguard basic human rights
and liberties; it would not be rational for you to choose it in the
original position. Rawls’ approach emphasises that there can be more
important goals than simply achieving the highest possible aggregate
happiness.

Gambling versus playing safe
Adopting the maximin strategy is a way of playing safe. It guarantees
that the worst off benefit from any inequalities built into social
institutions. Yet many of us see the point in gambling, and will risk
some discomfort for the chance of a substantial pay off. Why is it
not rational in the original position to choose a society in which there
is a high probability that I will do very well, even though I may in
fact do badly? To a gambler this may seem preferable to the safe
bet of the restricted inequalities that arise from application of the
difference principle.

Rawls’ response is that the gambler’s strategy is too risky; but
then the gambler thinks that Rawls’ approach is too conservative.

Libertarian objection
Libertarian philosophers, such as Robert Nozick (1938– ), have argued
that beyond preserving some basic rights, the state should not be
heavily involved in controlling social institutions. Nozick argues that
only a minimal state is justified, one which protects individuals against
theft and enforces contracts, but that any more extensive activity than
this will violate some people’s rights not to be coerced. Rawls’ just
society, in contrast, would, for example, tax property in a way that
corrects the distribution of wealth.

Here Nozick assumes that the right not to be coerced is more
fundamental than rights to equality of various kinds, and that rights
such as property rights override any other considerations. Rawls
makes different assumptions: he thinks that his principles, and in
particular his principle of a right to equal liberty, are the bedrock of
a just society. These represent two contrasting and incompatible
approaches to political philosophy.

  inequalities should only be tolerated on condition that they bring
  the greatest benefits to the most disadvantaged members of society.
libertarianism: a form of liberalism which stresses free choice above
  all. Libertarians oppose constraints on free choice imposed by
  political institutions and argue for a minimal state that simply
  protects against the use of force and theft.
maximin principle: short for ‘maximise the minimum’, which
  means choosing the option which gives the best deal in the worst
  case.
original position: the situation of ignorance about your place in society
  which is the starting point for Rawls’ thought experiment.
primary goods: the basic requirements for a reasonable life, such as
  food and shelter, but also various freedoms, opportunities and self-
  respect.
utilitarianism: the view that the morally right action in any
  circumstance is the one which will maximise happiness.
veil of ignorance: in Rawls’ thought experiment when we choose the
  kind of society we want we do not know what our position will be
  in that society: he uses the image of concealment with a veil.
