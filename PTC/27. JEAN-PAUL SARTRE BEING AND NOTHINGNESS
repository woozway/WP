JEAN-PAUL SARTRE
BEING AND
NOTHINGNESS

Being and Nothingness is the bible of existentialism. Yet despite its
centrality in the movement which swept through Europe and North
America in the postwar years, it is surprisingly obscure. Few of
the café existentialists could have read and understood much of this
book. In particular, the introduction is fiendishly difficult to make
sense of, especially if you don’t have a background in continental
philosophy. Yet despite the initial feelings of hopelessness that most
of those who attempt to read the book from cover to cover experience,
it is worth persevering. Being and Nothingness is one of very few
philosophical books written this century which genuinely grapple with
fundamental questions about the human predicament. In its more
lucid passages it can be both enlightening and exhilarating. Sartre’s
experience as a novelist and playwright is apparent in the memorable
descriptions of particular situations which form a substantial part
of the book.

The central theme of Being and Nothingness is encapsulated in
the enigmatic line ‘the nature of consciousness simultaneously is to
be what it is not and not to be what it is’. Whilst this might on first
reading sound like pseudoprofundity, it is in fact a summary of
Sartre’s account of what it is to be human. The full meaning of the
line should become apparent in the course of this chapter.

PHENOMENOLOGICAL APPROACH
A distinctive feature of Sartre’s writing in Being and Nothingness
is its focus on real or imagined situations described at some length.
This is not just a stylistic quirk but rather a feature of Sartre’s
phenomenological approach. Sartre is influenced by the philosopher
Edmund Husserl (1859–1938). Husserl believes that by describing the
contents of consciousness, setting on one side the question of whether
or not what appears to consciousness actually exists, insight into the
essence of things can be achieved. For Husserl an important part of
philosophy is descriptive: we should describe our experiences, not
simply reflect at an abstract level.

Sartre accepts this last aspect of Husserl’s thought, but rejects
the assumption that scrutiny of the contents of our consciousness
reveals the essential nature of what is being thought about. What
phenomenological method means in practice for Sartre is that he
concentrates on life as it is lived and felt, rather than on human beings
as described by science or empirical psychology. The result is a strange
mixture of highly abstract discussion interspersed with vivid and
memorable novelistic scenarios and descriptions.

BEING
The whole of Being and Nothingness rests on a fundamental
distinction between different forms of existence. Sartre draws
attention to the difference between conscious and non-conscious
being. The former he calls ‘being for-itself’; the latter, ‘being in-itself’.
Being for-itself is the kind of existence characteristically experienced
by human beings, and most of Being and Nothingness is devoted
to explaining its main features. Unfortunately Sartre provides no
answer to the question of whether or not non-human animals can
reasonably be categorised as examples of being for-itself. Being in-
itself, in contrast, is the being of non-conscious things, such as of a
stone on a beach.

NOTHINGNESS
Nothingness, as the title of the book suggests, plays a key role in
Sartre’s work. He characterises human consciousness as a gap at the
heart of our being, a nothing. Consciousness is always consciousness
of something. It is never simply itself. It is what allows us to project
ourselves into the future and to reassess our past.

Concrete nothingness is experienced when we recognise that
something is absent. You arrange to meet your friend Pierre in a
café at four. You arrive a quarter of an hour late and he is not there.
You are aware of him as a lack, an absence because you expected to
see him. This is very different from the absence of, say, Muhammad
Ali from the café, since you had not arranged to see him there: you
could play an intellectual game listing all the people who weren’t in
the café, but only Pierre’s absence in this case would be felt as a
genuine lack, since only Pierre was expected. This phenomenon, the
ability of human consciousness to see things as missing, is part of
what Sartre calls the transcendence of consciousness. It is linked up
with his idea of freedom, since it is our ability to see things as
unrealised, or as to be done, that reveals to us a world brimming with
possibilities. Or rather in some cases it reveals to us such a world; in
others the peculiar kind of self-deception that Sartre labels ‘bad faith’
gets a grip, and we don’t let ourselves recognise the true extent of
our freedom.

FREEDOM
Sartre believes that human beings have free will. Consciousness is
empty; it does not determine what we choose. We are not constrained
by the choices we have made in the past, though we may feel that
we are. We are free to choose whatever we wish. It is true that the
world won’t always allow us to fulfil our wishes. But that, like the
facts of when we were born and who our parents were, is an aspect
of what Sartre terms our ‘facticity’, those aspects of our lives which
are given. Yet even though we can’t change these things, we can
choose to change our attitude to them.

Sartre takes an extreme position on the question of individual
freedom, disregarding any theory which suggests that human beings
are entirely shaped by their genetic endowment and their upbringing.
For Sartre human beings are characterised by their ability to choose
what they become. However, Sartre does point out that things
aren’t quite so simple: human consciousness is constantly flirting
with what he calls bad faith, which is at bottom the denial of our
freedom.

BAD FAITH
Sartre’s discussion of bad faith is justly celebrated as one of the
classic passages in twentieth-century philosophy. Here his skills as
philosopher, psychologist and novelist are combined most successfully;
here his phenomenological method yields fruit in a way that so many
barren and abstract philosophical discussions of self-deception have
failed to do.

It is important to realise that Sartre is not interested in self-
deception as a general philosophical topic: bad faith is a particular
kind of self-deception which only makes sense within a theory which
postulates free will. Bad faith is a lie to oneself which is chosen as a
flight from freedom. It is a condition to which human consciousness
is particularly prone.

Consider Sartre’s description of a woman on a first date with a
man who has sexual intentions towards her. She is aware of the nature
of his interest, yet denies it to herself, lies to herself about the
significance of such comments as ‘I find you so attractive!’, turning
them into innocuous non-sexual compliments. She manages to sustain
her self-deception throughout the conversation. But then he takes
her hand. To leave her hand in his would be to flirt with him; to take
it away would ‘break the troubled and unstable harmony which gives
the hour its charm’. What does she do? She leaves her hand there,
but inert, a thing, neither consenting nor resisting, while she talks
loftily of her life, emphasising herself as personality rather than as
body. She is in bad faith because she deceives herself about the nature
of the man’s intentions. She pretends to herself that he is really
interested in her mind in order to avoid admitting the possibility that
she might reciprocate his desire. But she is also in bad faith because
she denies that she is her body and in doing so denies her freedom
to act, and the responsibility she has for her actions. She attempts to
make of her hand an in-itself rather than accept that it is her hand
in his.

Sartre’s most famous example of bad faith is of a café waiter. This
waiter seems determined by his role as a waiter. It is as if he is acting
a role. His movements are exaggerated: the way he bends forward to
the customer, or balances his tray. It is all a kind of ceremony, an
elaborate dance. Sartre points out that the waiter, however hard he
tries to become his role, cannot be a waiter as an inkwell is an inkwell.
A for-itself cannot by an act of will power metamorphose into an
in-itself (except, perhaps, by committing suicide). Sartre diagnoses
the waiter as someone trying to deny his freedom, as if he didn’t
have the choice of staying in bed rather than getting up at
5 o’clock, even though that would mean getting the sack. His
mechanical movements betray a desire to be what he cannot be, an
in-itself. Thus the waiter is in bad faith because he is deceiving himself
about the limits of his freedom.

In a different example, Sartre describes a homosexual man who
will not admit to his friend or indeed to himself that he is a homo-
sexual. True, his pattern of conduct has been that of a homosexual.
But he plays on two senses of the word ‘is’ when he claims he is not
a homosexual. In his own eyes he cannot be a homosexual because
no human individual is strictly determined by his or her past in
the way that a red-haired man is red-haired. As a being for-itself
he cannot simply make of his character an in-itself. Yet, in another
sense, given his past behaviour, he clearly is a homosexual: his
past sexual liaisons have been with men. The honest answer to the
question ‘Are you a homosexual?’ would be ‘In one sense no, and
another yes.’

His friend demands that the homosexual be sincere and come
out as homosexual. Yet the friend is as much in bad faith as the
homosexual since the demand for sincerity is a demand to make of
yourself an in-itself, to deny your freedom to act differently in the
future from the way you have done in the past. So sincerity is itself
a kind of bad faith.

The term ‘bad faith’ suggests that there is something bad about
being in this condition, that it is, perhaps, a moral fault. It also
suggests that authenticity, the opposite of bad faith, might be a
virtue. However, in Being and Nothingness Sartre’s approach is to
describe rather than to judge: this is not an instruction manual on
how to live but an account of what it is like to live. Sartre promised
to write a sequel to Being and Nothingness in which he would present
an existentialist ethics; however, he never published such a book.
Nevertheless, it is difficult to read Sartre’s account of bad faith without
concluding that Sartre thought that, on the whole, bad faith was culp -
able and a denial of what we truly are, namely free individuals.

Bad faith is possible because human beings are both transcendence
and facticity. Transcendence refers to our ability to think beyond the
facts of what is happening now and project ourselves into future
possibilities; facticity refers to the facts of our past, of what is now
happening, the givens of our existence which we can’t change at will.
We maintain ourselves in bad faith by keeping our transcendence and
facticity separate from each other, by thinking of ourselves either as
wholly different from our bodies (denying an aspect of our facticity,
as, for example, does the woman on her date) or else as wholly
different from our possibilities (pretending to be an in-itself, as, for
example, does the café waiter).

This discussion of transcendence and facticity goes some way to
explaining the meaning of the quotation about consciousness given
earlier in the chapter: ‘the nature of consciousness simultaneously is
to be what it is not and not to be what it is’. We are in one sense our
possibilities, our transcendence: not what we are now but what we
may become (i.e. consciousness ‘is what it is not’). And yet we aren’t
simply our facticity, a product of where we were born, how we were
brought up, what colour hair we have, how tall we are, how intelligent,
and so on.

CRITIQUE OF FREUD
Freud’s theory of the unconscious could have provided Sartre with a
convenient account of how it is that an individual can lie to him or
herself. According to Freud the psyche is divided into a conscious and
an unconscious part. Unconscious motives and thoughts are censored
and transformed before they can enter consciousness. The censor
represses some thoughts altogether, allowing others to emerge into
consciousness in disguised form, particularly in dreams or in so-called
‘Freudian slips’. Psychoanalysts frequently talk of the patients’
resistances to certain interpretations which get near to the truth; these
resistances are the work of the censor. If Sartre had accepted this
Freudian account, he could have explained bad faith as arising from
unconscious beliefs and their conscious denial. On this model the
human mind is fundamentally divided, almost the equivalent of two
people, so it is relatively easy to understand how someone could lie
to him or herself and yet believe the lie: it would simply be the
unconscious lying to the conscious.

Sartre criticises the Freudian picture of the mind. He argues that
if there were a censor between the unconscious and conscious aspects
of our minds, then this censor would have to be conscious of both
sides of the divide. In order to censor effectively, the censor would
have to know what is in the unconscious mind in order to repress or
transform it. If the censor is part of the unconscious, then there is a
consciousness within the unconscious. The Freudian is left with the
absurd situation of the conscious censor as part of the mind being
aware of what is in the unconscious in order to appear unaware of
what is in the unconscious (i.e. in order to repress all knowledge
of it). In other words, the censor would find itself in bad faith. So the
problem of how bad faith is possible would still remain for a Freudian;
the notion of the unconscious solves nothing since the problem is
simply moved on to the censor.

SHAME
Shame is an emotion which particularly interests Sartre because of
what it reveals of our relations with other people, or ‘the Other’, as
he usually expresses this. I see a man walking by some benches in
the park. My awareness of him as another for-itself causes me to re -
organise my experience of the park; I am suddenly aware of the fact
that he sees the grass and the benches from his own conscious point
of view, one which is not directly accessible to me. It is as if the Other
steals the world from me. My confident position at the centre of my
world is destabilised.

The impact of other people on our consciousness is most apparent
when we are aware of being watched. Being seen by the Other forces
me to be aware of myself as an object viewed by someone else, as
the following example from Being and Nothingness illustrates. Moved
by jealousy, I peer through a keyhole to see what is going on on the
other side of the door. I am completely immersed in what I see. In
this mode of consciousness, which Sartre labels non-thetic, or pre-
reflective, I am not aware of my self as a self, but only of what I see
or am thinking about. My mind is as it were entirely in the room
behind the door.

Suddenly, I hear footsteps in the hall behind me. I am aware that
someone is there looking at me. I am thrown into shame, judged by
this other person. I am jolted into an awareness of myself as an object
viewed by another consciousness: my own freedom escapes me as I
become objectified by the look of this other person.

LOVE
In love too there is the danger that our freedom will escape us. For
Sartre love is a kind of conflict: a struggle to enslave another without
becoming enslaved yourself. Yet the lover does not simply want to
possess but wants to be desired, and so needs the beloved to be free.
The complex play of wills can lead to masochism, the desire to be an
object for your lover. Yet even in masochism, the impossibility of
transforming yourself into an in-itself is apparent. Alternatively,
sadism, which flirts with the idea of turning the other person into
pure flesh, is equally futile in its goals. A glimpse into the eyes of
the other person reveals that he or she exists as a free individual, and
that total enslavement of that freedom is not possible.

MY DEATH
It can be tempting to think of death as part of life, as, perhaps, the
final chord of a melody giving meaning to what has gone before. Sartre
rejects this view. He thinks death is absurd: it has no meaning at all.
It is in almost every case impossible to be absolutely sure when you
will die. Sudden death is always a possibility; but it is not my
possibility. It is rather the removal of all my possibilities in the sense
that it takes away what makes me human: my ability to project
myself towards the future. It takes away all meaning for me since
the only meaning my life can have is that which I choose to give it.
At death we become ‘prey to the living’. What this means is that,
though while living we choose the meaning of our actions, at death
our actions are interpreted and given meaning by other people: we
cease to have any responsibility for them, and other people can make
of them what they will.

EXISTENTIAL PSYCHOANALYSIS
As we have seen, Sartre rejects out of hand the idea that there is a
split between the unconscious and the conscious mind. He wants
to replace Freudian psychoanalysis with his own freedom-based
approach to the mind, which he calls ‘existential psychoanalysis’.
Central to this is his notion of a fundamental choice of being or
original project. This is the core around which each of us organises
his or her personality, a choice about what fundamentally we are. It
is the aim of existential psychoanalysis to lay bare this original
project, a choice which informs the individual’s every subsequent
choice. Existential psychoanalysis differs from most other approaches
to human psychology in that it makes the individual entirely
responsible for his or her choice of being. We are not simply the
products of society or our genes, according to Sartre, but rather of
our own choices. That is what makes us human.

CRITICISMS OF BEING AND NOTHINGNESS

Overestimates human freedom
A major criticism of Sartre’s existentialism is that it presupposes a
degree of freedom that human beings don’t in fact have. He sometimes
writes as if we could choose to be anything; as if we could think beyond
the limitations imposed on us by our social situation and upbringing.
We make the choices that we do because of what we are, and we are
what we are because of what has happened to us. Sartre’s focus is
almost entirely on the individual and the choices he or she makes,
rather than on the social context in which groups of people live. For
many people, social, political and economic pressures are far more
constraining than Sartre seems to acknowledge.

This sort of deterministic criticism would not have discouraged
Sartre: he would simply deny that it is true, and probably suggest
that you reflect on your experience and see whether or not it really
was true of your life, or whether the adoption of the belief that it is
is a kind of bad faith in the face of extreme freedom. A reply to this
might be that feeling free is not necessarily the same as being free.
We might simply have the illusion of free will rather than the genuine
item. Perhaps all our actions are completely determined by what has
happened to us, and yet we have misleading feelings that they are
freely chosen.

Too pessimistic?
Whilst Sartre’s treatment of human freedom is perhaps over-
optimistic, his account of human relations is extremely pessimistic.
We are constantly on the brink either of turning the other person
into an object, an in-itself, or of attempting to turn ourselves into
objects for him or her. He even goes so far as to describe humanity
as ‘a useless passion’. Perhaps this is an overly bleak description of
what it is to be human. Sartre simply disagrees. In his defence it must
be said that for many readers his account of freedom and bad faith
has a liberating effect and a direct influence on their lives. They take
responsibility for what they are rather than trying to find excuses
for failing to achieve what they want from their lives.
