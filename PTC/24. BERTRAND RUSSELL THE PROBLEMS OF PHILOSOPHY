BERTRAND RUSSELL
THE PROBLEMS OF
PHILOSOPHY

Bertrand Russell described this little book as his ‘shilling shocker’ –
a cheap, short book, written quickly for a general readership, yet it
has remained in print for almost a century. Although by no means
his major philosophical work, this, along with his opinionated survey,
A History of Western Philosophy, is one of his most read books.
Indeed, until the early 1980s, The Problems of Philosophy was the
book most likely to be recommended reading for students considering
studying the subject at university, despite having been written in 1911
and first published in January 1912.

The most plausible reason for its continued use, apart from its
brevity, is the vision of what philosophy is that Russell presents within
it. Much of the book consists of brief summaries of the work of
Descartes, Berkeley, Hume, Kant and other major philosophers. There
are also some original contributions within this. But it is when he
expounds his own view of the limits and value of philosophy that
Russell’s sincerity and enthusiasm for the subject emerges. This is
where the book moves on to a higher plane and can be inspiring. In
contrast, some other parts of the book are like a dusty and rather
abstract lecture that has already been given many times to under-
graduates. In places, too, the book fails to serve its purpose as an
introduction: only someone with a firm grasp of the basics of
philosophy would be in a position to follow every sentence of Russell’s
at times condensed argument.

THE TITLE
Despite its title, this book covers quite a narrow range of phil-
osophical problems. Its main focus is the limits of what we can know:
the area of philosophy known as epistemology. Ethics, aesthetics,
political philosophy, philosophy of religion, and many other import-
ant areas are only mentioned in passing, if at all.

The choice of the word ‘problems’ in the title suggests the
equivalent of mathematical problems: equations and the like that need
to be solved. But Russell points out that philosophy differs from those
subjects where there can be straightforward right answers. This is an
aspect of the vision of philosophy that he presents throughout the
book, but particularly in its two concluding chapters.

WHAT IS PHILOSOPHY?
Many people, including some great philosophers of the past, have
come to the subject hoping it will solve major metaphysical questions
about the ultimate nature of reality, right and wrong, beauty and so
forth, but, Russell says, this is a vain hope. Philosophy doesn’t give
simple answers. Philosophers ask questions; often they cannot answer
those questions. Indeed, Russell acknowledges that philosophy has
not been particularly successful in answering with any certainty most
of the questions that philosophers ask. But that does not mean that
philosophy is a waste of time. By asking deep questions we make life
more interesting and reveal that a little below the surface of our
comfortable assumptions lies a much stranger world.

So anyone coming to philosophy expecting it to provide knowledge
of reality is likely to be disappointed. What philosophy can provide,
however, is the possibility of ordering our less than certain beliefs
and getting some insights into the ways in which we acquire them.
Even if it can’t provide us with certainties, philosophy can make us
less likely to be wrong about our basic beliefs than if we had left them
unexamined.

There is a clear distinction between philosophy and science, though
historically many of the problems of philosophy have later become
scientific questions. Science can be extremely useful to us even if we
never study it: all of us have the potential to benefit from medical
science, science-based technology and so on, whether or not we
understand the science underpinning the inventions. Philosophy
differs from this. Studying philosophy can have a profound effect on
the student who thinks through the issues; but those who don’t study
the subject are only likely to benefit from the effects on the student
of philosophy. There are no direct benefits from philosophy for those
who don’t actually study it themselves.

The real value of philosophy, however, Russell declares, lies in its
uncertainty. If you never question your beliefs, then you can cling
to prejudices that need never be subjected to critical assessment.
If, however, you begin to question beliefs that have previously
seemed uncontroversial, with the help of a philosophical approach
you will free yourself from the ‘tyranny of custom’ and awaken a
less dogmatic sense of wonder at the strangeness of the world and
our position in it. This opening up of possibilities enriches our
imaginations. Philosophical contemplation takes us away from the
purely individual concerns of our lives, moving us towards becoming
‘citizens of the universe’. Our minds become great by contemplating
greatness in this impartial spirit. In the combination of these factors
lies philosophy’s value to humanity.

One traditional approach to philosophy (usually known as
rationalism) has been to attempt to prove truths about the nature of
reality a priori, that is independently of any experience, by pure reason
alone. In place of this Russell offers something much closer to John
Locke’s account of the philosopher as ‘underlabourer’ to science
(though Russell does not identify the source of this idea). For Russell,
philosophy is the activity of investigating the principles that we use
both in science and in everyday life, and subjecting them to a critical
scrutiny that reveals any inconsistencies. This, Russell believed,
shouldn’t result in a destructive scepticism that leaves everything in
doubt. Indeed, one theme of The Problems of Philosophy is that there
are beliefs, such as that our perceptual experiences exist, that are
beyond doubt. In contrast, the belief that physical objects are really
as they appear to us, is open to philosophical doubt. Much of the
book focuses on questions about our knowledge of the world as it is
acquired through the senses and by reason.

APPEARANCE AND REALITY
Is there any knowledge so certain that no reasonable person could
doubt it? This is Russell’s opening question. If we look at a table it
seems a particular shape, colour and texture to us. But do we really
know that it is as it seems? If we analyse our experience more closely
we very soon discover that, for example, the ‘real’ shape of the table
is something inferred from what we see. A rectangular table does not
appear to have right-angled corners from almost any angle it is
viewed. When I say I see a table over there I am in some senses
begging the question about what I see. Russell uses the more neutral
term ‘sense data’ (the singular is ‘sense datum’) to refer to what we
see – the patches of colour and shape. Sensations are mental; sense
data are the things that we see, and are, he presumes, not entirely
mental. What I see, what appears to be in front of me are sense data.
I have data that I take to be of a real table. I see something of a
particular colour and particular shape: the sense data are our means
of access to the real table. But the sense data don’t seem to correspond
perfectly with what we take to be the real table. The table doesn’t
seem to be the sense data: we take the table to have an oblong top
and a brownish red colour, perhaps, but as I experience it now, the
sense data are of a parallelogram of yellowish brown.

Bishop Berkeley’s solution to this problem was to declare that there
is no real table independent of sense data: matter doesn’t exist. To be
is to be perceived. Russell rejects such idealism. He recognises that
there is no logical absurdity in supposing that there is nothing
more than my mind and its experiences. Nor is there any logical
absurdity in thinking the whole of life a dream. But the common
sense hypothesis that objects exist independently of us and differ from
their appearances, an example of what he calls an instinctive belief,
is a simpler explanation and so we should prefer it. (In passing he
comments that beliefs about moral values are also instinctive, but
he later changed his mind about this.) Russell believed that all our
knowledge ultimately rests on and is built up from such instinctive
beliefs.

KNOWLEDGE BY ACQUAINTANCE AND BY
DESCRIPTION
The distinction between knowledge by acquaintance and know-
ledge by description is an important one for Russell. For him it is
clear that we have knowledge of truths and knowledge of things.
Our knowledge of things comes by either acquaintance or description.
Knowledge by acquaintance is the foundation of all our knowledge.
Knowledge by acquaintance involves a direct awareness of the thing
that we know. So, for example, I have direct knowledge – knowledge
by acquaintance – of my sense data. I am acquainted with what I see.
But we also have knowledge by acquaintance of our own mem-
ories, and, when we introspect, we have knowledge by acquaintance
of our sensations.

In contrast, knowledge by description is the kind of knowledge
that takes us beyond our direct acquaintance. Knowledge by
description would include the knowledge that someone who had never
visited Australia might have that Canberra is the capital city of
Australia. So, for Russell, as we have seen, we don’t have direct
knowledge of physical objects, only of sense data, so our knowledge
of real physical objects, as opposed to sense data, is knowledge by
description too. Knowledge by description is how we move beyond
our own personal direct experience and get to know things that we
haven’t experienced ourselves. In The Problems of Philosophy Russell
declares that every proposition that we understand must ultimately
be dependent on some things that we know by acquaintance.

THE A PRIORI
Immanuel Kant famously argued that we can learn by pure thought
about principles that must apply to all our experience – these are
the very conditions of thought at all. So-called a priori knowledge,
what we know independently of experience, was traditionally
restricted to the category known as analytic truths: those that are
true by definition, such as ‘All bachelors are unmarried.’ Against this
Kant announced that there could be synthetic a priori knowledge: a
priori knowledge of matters that weren’t true by definition. He put
our knowledge of time, space and cause and effect in this category:
he believed that it was a feature of our understanding rather than of
the world that all our experiences and all possible experiences included
these elements. Russell, however, rejects Kant’s conclusions, arguing
that a priori knowledge is only ever of relations and qualities, never
of facts directly about the world.

INDUCTION
Russell’s outline of the so-called Problem of Induction in Chapter 6
of his book follows David Hume’s quite closely. Why are we all
convinced that the sun will rise tomorrow? Simply because it has
always risen in the past. Have we got good reason to believe that the
future will be like the past? We assume a uniformity of nature in
this respect. But consider the chicken fed by the farmer every day.
As Russell points out, on the day that the farmer wrings its neck
‘more refined views as to the uniformity of nature would have been
useful to the chicken’.

We are left recognising that experience of past uniformity of
nature is not a completely reliable guide to the future. Just because
we have never had an exception to an apparent uniformity of nature,
it does not follow that there never could be one. It just makes it
improbable that this will occur. As Russell points out, this cuts two
ways. We can’t prove the reliability of the principle of induction using
experience, since that would be begging the question: using induction
to justify the principle of induction. But equally we can’t prove that
the future won’t be like the past

CRITICISMS OF THE PROBLEMS OF
PHILOSOPHY

Wrong about the point of philosophy?
Russell characterised philosophy as a way of stepping back from our
individual concerns, revealing our uncertainties to ourselves, and as
an antidote to dogmatism. This view of the subject can be challenged.
Ludwig Wittgenstein, Russell’s sometime pupil, hated The Problems
of Philosophy. This may well have been in part because Wittgenstein
had a very different vision of what philosophy was. For Wittgenstein,
at least in his later years, philosophy was something that required a
kind of intellectual therapy: philosophical problems often arose from
a strange forcing of language to do things that it couldn’t do.
Philosophy should be a process of taking away mystery, not creating
a sense of mystery.

From a different direction, Friedrich Nietzsche’s claim in Beyond
Good and Evil that philosophy is a kind of involuntary autobiography
wrapped up to make it seem impersonal, if true, would undermine
Russell’s suggestion that philosophy takes us away from the merely
personal to a more general level. If Nietzsche is right, all philosophy
is riddled with philosophers’ own personal prejudices and heartfelt
desires.

Over-optimistic bibliographical note
At the very end of his book, Russell claims that students who want
to learn more about philosophy will find it ‘both easier and more
profitable’ to read some original works of the great philosophers
than to turn to handbooks of philosophy. He lists works by Plato,
Descartes, Leibniz, Berkeley, Hume and Kant. Russell’s assertion
may reflect the kind of introductory books available in 1911. Some
of the texts he recommends, notably Spinoza’s Ethics, are far from
an easy read for beginning students, or anyone else.

Whilst it is certainly still true that most students would benefit
from reading some primary texts early on in their study of phil-
osophy, it is no longer true, if it ever was, that it is either ‘easier’ or
‘more profitable’ to do this than to read the best available introductory
works, such as those that I recommend in the ‘Further Reading’
sections of each chapter here. This is an example of a widespread
phenomenon that still persists: professional philosophers are
notoriously bad at appreciating how difficult philosophy can be for a
beginning student. For many students it would be just as profitable
to recommend battering your head against a brick wall as to attempt
to read Spinoza’s Ethics without any commentary or introduction to
its main themes.
