DAVID HUME DIALOGUES
CONCERNING NATURAL
RELIGION

Apart from Plato, very few philosophers have written successfully in
dialogue form. David Hume is the most impressive exception.
His Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion is a masterpiece both
of philosophical argument and literary execution. Unlike Plato, who
gave Socrates all the best lines, Hume shares the good arguments
between the three main speakers, Demea, Cleanthes and Philo, though
it is clear that his sympathies, on the whole, lie with the last of these.
The effect is to draw the reader into the debate. The ‘correct’ view is
not clearly labelled as such, and must be discovered through the cut
and thrust of the dialogue, a technique he borrowed from the Latin
author Cicero.

Hume did not publish this work in his lifetime: he feared per-
secution from the religious authorities. However, he took great
pains to make sure that it was published posthumously. The central
topic of the book is the Design Argument for the existence of the
Christian God. The Design Argument was the mainstay of advocates
of natural religion, that is, those who based their religious beliefs
on scientific evidence. Natural religion was usually contrasted with
revelation. Revelation was the supposed proof of God’s existence and
attributes provided by the Gospels, with their accounts of miracles
performed by Christ, and in particular his resurrection. Hume had
already mounted a sustained attack on the claims of revelation in his
controversial essay ‘Of Miracles’, which appeared in his An Enquiry
Concerning Human Understanding (discussed in the previous
chapter). In the Dialogues, natural religion comes under fire, though
in a more oblique way since the arguments are given by fictional
characters rather than in Hume’s own voice.

THE CHARACTERS
Although five characters are mentioned by name in the Dialogues,
the debate is all carried by the three main speakers: Cleanthes, Demea
and Philo. The whole conversation is reported by Pamphilus to his
friend Hermippus, but neither of them joins in the philosophical
discussion.

Each of the three main characters defends a recognisable position.
Cleanthes believes in the Design Argument, the view that the apparent
design in the universe proves the existence of God. He is, then, a
defender of natural religion. Demea is a fideist: that is, he does not
put his trust in reason, but makes a commitment of faith that God
exists and that he has the attributes ascribed to him. However, he
also believes that the so-called First Cause Argument provides
conclusive proof of God’s existence. Philo, whose arguments are, with
one possible exception, the arguments that Hume himself would have
been happy to use, is a mitigated sceptic. His principal role in the
Dialogues is to criticise the positions put forward by the other two
main characters and thereby demonstrate that reason can reveal
nothing significant about God’s attributes. In particular, his critique
of the Design Argument and the conclusions which can be drawn
from it is devastating. For most of the book it would be easy to take
Philo to be an atheist. Nevertheless, he does state that he thinks it is
obvious that God exists and that the important questions are about
which attributes he has. Whether this was simply an ironic touch
added by Hume to avoid accusations of racism is unclear.

THE DESIGN ARGUMENT
Cleanthes puts forward the ‘argument a posteriori’ which is now
better known as the Design Argument. A posteriori arguments are
arguments from experience. This is the argument that we can prove
the existence of an all-powerful, all-knowing, benevolent God by
considering the natural world. If we look around us we find that every
aspect of the natural world bears the marks of apparent design. It all
fits together like a machine. For instance, the human eye is brilliantly
suited to seeing; the lens, cornea and retina seem to have been thought
up by a superior intelligence and the design and construction of the
eye is more skilful than anything made by human hands. The con -
clusion that Cleanthes draws from this sort of observation is that the
natural world must have been designed by an intelligent creator. This
creator must have had an intelligence in proportion to the magnitude
and grandeur of his work and so must have been God as traditionally
conceived. In other words, Cleanthes draws an analogy between nature
and human artifacts, and on the basis of this concludes not only that
God exists, but that he is all-powerful, all-knowing and benevolent.

To lend further support to his argument, Cleanthes uses several
memorable examples. If we were to hear a voice speaking intelligently
in the dark we would certainly, and quite reasonably, conclude that
there was somebody there. The articulate voice in the dark would be
sufficient evidence for this conclusion. The works of nature provide,
according to Cleanthes, at least as much evidence for God’s existence
as would an articulate voice speaking in the dark prove the presence
of a speaker.

Another example Cleanthes uses is the vegetating library. Imagine
books were living things which could reproduce like plants. If we
discovered a book with its markings (words arranged in a meaningful
order), then we would treat this as conclusive proof of its having
been written by an intelligent being. Even if books reproduced
themselves, this would not detract from the evidence they present
that they contain the traces of thought. Similarly, Cleanthes alleges,
we can read intelligence and design in the works of nature. Only a
blind dogmatist would deny the evidence that nature provides for
God’s existence and attributes. Or so Cleanthes believes. However,
much of the Dialogues is taken up with Philo, and to a certain extent
Demea, attacking Cleanthes’ argument.

CRITICISMS OF THE DESIGN ARGUMENT

Weakness of analogy
One argument that Philo uses against the Design Argument is that
it rests on a relatively weak analogy between the natural world, or
parts of it, and human creations. Arguments from analogy rely on
there being pronounced similarities between the two things being
compared. If the similarities are relatively superficial, then any
conclusion drawn on their basis will be weak and will require
independent evidence or argument as support.

If we examine a house, then it is quite reasonable to conclude from
its structure that it has been designed by a builder or an architect.
This is because we have had experience of similar effects (other
buildings) being brought about by this sort of cause (being designed
by a builder or an architect). So far we are on firm ground when we
use an argument from analogy. But when the entire universe is
compared to something like a house the dissimilarity between the
things compared is so striking that any conclusions based on the
alleged analogy between the two can be nothing more than guesswork.
Yet Cleanthes treats just this sort of argument from analogy as
conclusive evidence for God’s existence and attributes.

Limitations on the conclusion
The basic principle that underlies the Design Argument is that similar
effects are produced by similar causes. Because the parts and whole
of the natural world resemble a machine in some respects, it is
reasonable to conclude that they originate from the same sort of
cause as does a machine, namely intelligent design. However, if this
principle is applied rigorously, as Philo points out, Cleanthes would
be forced into an extreme form of anthropomorphism (the tendency
to attribute human characteristics to non-human things, in this
case to God).

For instance, traditional theology teaches that God is perfect.
But if we take the analogy between divine and human designers
seriously, we can’t be justified in claiming that God is perfect, since
human designers, manifestly, are not perfect. In which case, even if
the design argument does prove the existence of a creator, it is
spectacularly uninformative about his attributes.

To take another example: traditional theology is monotheistic.
However, most complicated large-scale human projects are achieved
as a result of teams of designers and builders working together. If we
make strict use of analogy when trying to explain the creation of the
universe, then we will have to take seriously the suggestion that the
universe was created by a team of gods.

Alternative explanations
Philo also suggests several alternative explanations of the apparent
order and design in the world. Some of these are deliberately far-
fetched. His point is that if we scrutinise the evidence provided by
the Design Argument it can’t rule out these alternatives. There is
at least as much evidence for them as there is that the Christian God
is the source of order and design in the universe.

For instance, at one point Philo gets very close to suggesting a
theory of evolution on the lines of natural selection. He conjectures
that apparent design could have arisen from the fact that those animals
not well adapted to the environment in which they find themselves
simply die. Thus we should not be surprised to find animals well-
adapted to their surroundings. After Darwin put forward his ideas
about evolution, almost a century after Hume’s Dialogues, most
scientists have taken the theory of an impersonal natural selection as
the best available explanation of the apparent design exhibited by
animals and plants.

Another explanation that Philo toys with is that of a gigantic spider
spinning the universe from its abdomen. His point is that order and
apparent design don’t necessarily stem from an intelligent brain.
Spiders spin webs with order and design, yet they spin from their
abdomens. The analogy between a spider and a creator of the universe
may seem absurd, Philo agrees. But if there were a planet inhabited
solely by spiders, then it would seem the most natural explanation
of order, as natural as it seems to us that all apparent design stems
from human-like thought.

Evil
The most destructive criticism of the Design Argument is provided
by the problem of evil. How could a benevolent God have designed
a world in which there is so much suffering? Philo paints a picture
of human life beset with pain. Cleanthes’ response is that such pain
might be the lesser of two evils. His claim is that the reason God
designed a world with so much potential for pain and suffering
built into it was that any alternative world would have been even
worse. But, as Philo insists, an omnipotent God could have created a
better world. Or at least that’s how it seems to mere mortals. Philo
identifies four principal causes of suffering, none of which seem
necessary, but all of which are part of the human condition.

First, we are so constituted that pain as well as pleasure is in some
cases needed to stir us into action. We seem to have been designed
so that, for instance, the discomfort of extreme thirst gives us a
strong incentive to find some water; whereas, Philo thinks, we could
have been driven purely by the desire for pleasure of varying degrees.
Second, the world, including the human world, strictly follows
what he calls ‘general laws’. These are the laws of physics. A direct
result of this is that all sorts of calamities occur. Yet surely a
good and omnipotent God could intervene to stop such events.
A few minor adjustments (such as in the present century removing
a few parts of Stalin’s and Hitler’s brains) would have produced a
much better world with far less suffering in it. But God chose
not to intervene. Third, nature equips us with the bare minimum
that we need to survive. This makes us vulnerable to the slightest
fluctuation in our circumstances. Philo suggests that a benevolent
parent-like God would have provided more generously for us in such
things as food and natural strength. Fourth, Philo points to the bad
workmanship evident in the design of the universe, at least when it
is seen from a human perspective. Thus we find that although rain
is necessary to help plants grow and to give us drink, it frequently
rains so hard that flooding results. This and many other ‘design
faults’ lead Philo to the conclusion that the creator of the universe
must have been indifferent to human suffering. Certainly the Design
Argument does not provide sufficient evidence to warrant a belief in
a benevolent creator.

THE FIRST CAUSE ARGUMENT
Although most of the discussion in the Dialogues focuses on the
Design Argument, this is not the only alleged proof of God’s existence
and nature that is brought up. Demea is an ardent defender of what
he calls the ‘simple and sublime argument a priori’, better known as
the Cosmological or First Cause Argument. This is the argument
which begins with the assumption that anything that exists must have
had a prior cause which explains its existence. If we trace the chain
of effects and causes back in time we must either keep on going back
in what is known as an infinite regress; or else we will find an
uncaused cause, one that necessarily exists. Demea thinks the first
option absurd, and so concludes that the necessarily existing uncaused
cause is the first cause of everything and is God. Cleanthes’ response
includes the argument that if we are looking for a first cause of
everything we needn’t go back further than to the universe itself:
there is no need to postulate a cause preceding that. Or, to put it
another way, even if the First Cause Argument proves that there is
a necessarily existing being, it does not prove that that cause is God
as traditionally conceived by Christians.

WAS HUME AN ATHEIST?
I have already mentioned the difficulty of unravelling precisely what
Hume believed about religion on the basis of the Dialogues. Philo,
despite being the character closest intellectually to Hume, is not
simply a mouthpiece for the philosopher. Many of Hume’s contem-
poraries took it for granted that he was an atheist, and no doubt if
the Dialogues had been published during his lifetime it would have
been treated as conclusive proof of this. However, it is interesting
that Hume was genuinely shocked when he met unashamed atheists
in Paris in the 1760s, though his views might have changed by the
end of his life.

His official doctrine was mitigated scepticism: a moderate form of
scepticism which takes nothing on trust but does not go to the absurd-
ities of those sceptics who attempt to live as if nothing whatsoever
could be taken for granted. Mitigated scepticism applied to questions
of religion points in the direction of atheism, but stops short of
it. The mitigated sceptic would not accept the Design Argument as
proof of the Christian God’s existence or attributes. But saying that
there is insufficient evidence on which to base a belief in God’s
existence is not the same as asserting that God definitely does not
exist. Hume might have considered atheism itself a dogmatic position,
that is, one for which there is insufficient evidence. Perhaps, then,
Hume really did believe, along with Philo, that the universe had some
kind of intelligent creator. However, he certainly believed that human
reason was insufficient to give us detailed knowledge of what that
creator, if there was one, might be like. He died without holding out
any hope of an afterlife.
