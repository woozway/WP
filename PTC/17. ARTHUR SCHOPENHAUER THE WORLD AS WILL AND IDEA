ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER
THE WORLD AS WILL
AND IDEA

The World as Will and Idea has often been com pared to a symphony
in four movements. Each of its four sections has a distinctive mood
and tempo, and Schopenhauer returns to and develops themes touched
upon in earlier sections. The book opens with an abstract discussion
of our relation to the world we experience, the world as we represent
it to ourselves (the world as idea). In the second section this discussion
broadens out, suggesting that there is a deeper reality than the world
which science describes; this world, the thing-in-itself (the world as
will), can be glimpsed when we observe our own willed bodily
movements. The third section is an optimistic and detailed discussion
of art. Here Schopenhauer develops his claim that art can provide an
escape from the relentless willing that is the normal human condition,
whilst revealing aspects of the deeper reality, the world as will. Finally,
a darker pessimism takes over in the fourth section, in which he
explains why we are doomed to suffering by our very nature. Yet
there is a glimmer of hope if we are prepared to live a life of asceticism,
relinquishing our desires.

THE WORLD AS IDEA
When Schopenhauer begins The World as Will and Idea with the
line ‘The world is my idea’, he means that experience is always from
the perspective of a perceiving consciousness. We represent the world
to ourselves rather than have immediate access to the underlying
nature of reality. But the world as idea doesn’t yield knowledge of
the true nature of things. If we rest satisfied with appearances we
are like a man who goes round a castle trying to find its entrance,
stopping every now and then to sketch the walls. According to
Schopenhauer, this is all philosophers until now have done. His
philosophy, however, purports to give us knowledge about what lies
behind the walls.

The question of the ultimate nature of reality is the central question
of metaphysics. Schopenhauer accepts Immanuel Kant’s division
between the world as we experience it, what Schopenhauer calls the
world as idea, and the underlying reality of the thing-in-itself. Kant
calls the reality behind experience the noumenal world; Schopen-
hauer calls it the world as will. We aren’t simply passive recipients
of sensory information; rather, we impose the categories of time, space
and causation on all our experience. But at the level of the thing-in-
itself, the world as will, these categories do not apply. The world as
will is an indivisible whole. What Schopenhauer calls the principium
individuationis, the division into particular things, only occurs in the
phenomenal world. The world as will is the entirety of all that exists.

THE WORLD AS WILL
It might seem that the world as will is by definition inaccessible to
human beings, since it would seem not to be accessible through
experience. However, Schopenhauer declares that in our experience
of willing, the power we have to move our bodies, the world as will
shows itself. The will is not separate from bodily movement: it is an
aspect of that movement. When we are conscious of our own willing,
we go beyond the world as idea and can get a glimpse of the thing-
in-itself. We experience our own body both as idea, another object
encountered in the world, and as will.

For Schopenhauer it is not just human beings who are manifes -
tations of will: ultimately everything is an expression of will. In other
words, he uses the word ‘will’ in an extended sense. A lump of rock,
for instance, is an expression of will. The will that he describes
is not an intelligence; it is a blind, directionless striving which con -
demns most human beings to lives of suffering.

ART
Art has a pre-eminent position in Schopenhauer’s philosophy. The
contemplation of works of art allows us to escape momentarily from
the relentless grind of willing that is otherwise inevitable. Art allows
us a disinterested aesthetic experience. When we contemplate a work
of art we can, and should, set aside any practical concerns and cares,
any notion of the work of art serving a function for us. We lose
ourselves in contemplation. The same is true of our experience of
beauty in nature: we can achieve this state of peaceful contemplation
looking at a waterfall or a mountain just as much as at a great
painting.

Artistic geniuses can achieve this state of disinterested contem-
plation of objects and events, and have the intellectual ability to
communicate their emotion to audiences of their work. Such geniuses
have the capacity for pure knowing: they can experience the Platonic
Forms of what they perceive. Plato famously believes that the
chair I’m sitting on is an imperfect copy of an ideal chair, the Form
of the chair. For Plato, an artist who paints the chair puts the view
at several removes from the real chair, the Platonic Form. This is one
of his reasons for banning artists from his ideal republic: they deal
in distant copies of reality, and distance us from the Forms. Schopen-
hauer, in contrast, believes that artistic geniuses can, through their
work, reveal the Forms or Platonic Ideas of the particular things which
they depict or describe. Thus artistic geniuses allow us to escape from
the power of will and achieve an impersonal knowledge of the Platonic
Forms.

Beautiful objects and scenes are well suited to jolt us out of the
endless stream of desiring. Some depicted objects, however, are better
suited to this than others. We can contemplate the beauty of depicted
fruit, for example, but our practical interest may make it very difficult
to remain disinterested, particularly if we are hungry. Similarly,
some paintings of nudes are easier to contemplate disinterestedly than
others; some tend to arouse the viewer sexually, thereby reasserting
a practical interest.

Sublime objects and scenes, in contrast to those which are simply
beautiful, are ones which are in some way hostile to the human will.
They threaten with their immensity or power. Black thunder-clouds,
huge bare crags, a river rushing in torrent: all these can be sublime.
The aesthetic experience of the sublime is achieved by consciously
detaching yourself from the will, lingering pleasurably over what
would otherwise be terrifying. This again reveals the Platonic Forms
of the objects contemplated.

The Platonic Forms revealed in the aesthetic contemplation of art
and nature are important to Schopenhauer because they allow us a
kind of knowledge of the thing-in-itself, the world as will. We can’t
get direct knowledge of the thing-in-itself by this means; but the
Platonic Forms give ‘the most adequate objectification of the will’.
This simply means that the world they reveal is not subjectively
distorted, but is as close as is possible to the thing-in-itself.

MUSIC
Music differs from other arts in that it doesn’t represent the
world as idea. It doesn’t usually represent anything at all. Yet it is
undeniably a great art. Schopenhauer gives it a special place in his
system. Music, he says, is a copy of the will itself. This explains its
profundity: it can reveal to us the nature of reality.

Music which is sad doesn’t express a particular person’s sadness,
or suggest sadness in a particular context: it expresses sadness in its
essential nature, removed from particular circumstances. Ultimately,
though, it is a copy of the will. A consequence of this view is that
music is a kind of unconscious metaphysics. It gives us a picture of
the thing-in-itself, just as the metaphysician attempts to explain to
us what lies behind the veil of appearance. Schopenhauer is well aware
that his views on music and its relation to the thing-in-itself are
unverifiable: there is no way of comparing a Beethoven string quartet
with the thing-in-itself to see if he is correct. However, he presents
his account as a plausible explanation of music’s power, and suggests
that the reader should try listening to music bearing in mind the
theory.

FREE WILL
All phenomena are bound by the principle of sufficient reason, the
principle that for everything there is a reason why it is as it is. This
applies as much to human beings as it does to rocks and plants.
Our behaviour is, then, entirely determined by biology, past events,
our character. We only have the illusion of acting freely. However,
the will, the thing-in-itself, is entirely free. So human beings are both
determined and free. The suggestion that we are, even if only at the
phenomenal level, determined is a pessimistic one. The stream of
pessimism that runs through the whole book becomes a raging torrent
when Schopenhauer focuses on the nature of human suffering.

SUFFERING AND SALVATION
Here he draws heavily on a tradition of Asian philosophy, including
Buddhist and Hindu teachings. Sustained periods of happiness are
an impossibility for human beings. We are so constructed that our
lives involve constant willing, seeking satisfaction. When we
achieve what we desire, we may enjoy momentary happiness, which
is nothing more than the relief from wanting what we were seeking.
But this is inevitably short-lived. We either sink into a state of
ennui (an intense state of boredom), or else find that we still have
unfulfilled desires which drive us on to seek their satisfaction. All
human life is, then, tossed backwards and forwards between pain and
boredom.

If, however, we gain insight into the true nature of reality, if we
see through the veil of Maya (i.e. gain knowledge of the world as
will), then there is a chance of salvation and of a permanent escape
from suffering, a state which is at least as blissful as the temporary
states of aesthetic contemplation which art can afford.

A first step in this direction is the recognition that inflicting harm
on others is a kind of self-injury, since at the level of will, the person
who inflicts harm and the person who suffers it are one. It is only at
the level of phenomena that we perceive them as different. If we see
this, then we will recognise all suffering as in a sense our own, and
be motivated to prevent such suffering. We will recognise that when
one person harms another it is as if the will were a crazed beast which
sinks its teeth into its own flesh, not realising that it was injuring
itself.

The more extreme move which Schopenhauer outlines at the end
of The World as Will and Idea is asceticism, a deliberate denial of
the will to life. The ascetic lives a life of sexual chastity and poverty,
not in order to help others, but rather to extinguish desire, and ultim -
ately to mortify the will. By this extreme policy, the ascetic escapes
the otherwise inevitable suffering of the human condition.

CRITICISMS OF THE WORLD AS WILL AND IDEA

Fragile metaphysical foundations
Schopenhauer’s book sets out a system of thought which has
fragile metaphysical foundations. The entire framework relies on our
gaining knowledge of the thing-in-itself, or at least some access to
it, via our awareness of our own willed bodily movements. But if
Schopenhauer is mistaken about the possibility of such access to the
world as will, then the entire work is undermined. It seems at times
that Schopenhauer wants to have his cake and eat it: he wants to say
both that the veil of Maya prevents us from knowing about the
ultimate nature of reality and that we can see through this veil.

However, even if we reject the metaphysical foundations of
Schopenhauer’s thought, there are many insights about art, experience
and suffering that can be gleaned from this book. The fact that the
system as a whole may be flawed does not prevent Schopenhauer
from providing us with a rich source of ideas and speculation. It is
not surprising that practising artists have found Schopenhauer’s work
inspirational.

Hypocrisy
Schopenhauer preached asceticism as the route to salvation and an
end to the suffering that would otherwise be an inevitable feature of
the human condition. Yet he didn’t practise what he preached: he
didn’t practise sexual chastity, and he enjoyed a good meal. So why
should we take such a hypocrite seriously?

This attack doesn’t seriously damage Schopenhauer’s philosophy:
it is entirely possible for someone to recognise the route to salva-
tion without actually pursuing it himself. Whilst hypocrisy is an
unattractive character trait, it does not affect the strength of his
arguments. If Schopenhauer was right that asceticism provides a way
of eliminating suffering, then this is completely independent of how
he actually chose to live his life.

GLOSSARY
asceticism: a way of living which involves extreme self-denial.
disinterestedness: the attitude of someone who has no practical
  motivation for looking at something.
ennui: boredom, listlessness.
idea: the world as we represent it to ourselves. Contrasted with the
  world as will.
Idea (Platonic): the perfect Form of anything. Plato believed that, for
  instance, the perfect Form of a chair exists. All the chairs we
  perceive are simply imperfect copies of this Form or Platonic Idea.
metaphysics: the study of the ultimate nature of reality.
phenomena: Kant’s term for the world we experience, in contrast to
  noumena, which lie behind appearances.
principium individuationis: the division of reality into particular
individual things: this does not occur at the noumenal level, the
  level of the world as will.
sublime: that which is threatening to humanity yet which, when made
  the object of aesthetic experience, reveals its Platonic Idea. A
  thunderstorm, for example, can be sublime rather than merely
  beautiful.
Veil of Maya: the barrier which prevents us perceiving the world as
  will, the world as it really is.
will: the thing-in-itself, the ultimate reality which lies behind
  phenomena, for the most part inaccessible to us, but which is
  glimpsed when we will bodily movements, and mirrored in music.
