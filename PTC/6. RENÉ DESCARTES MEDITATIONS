MEDITATIONS

Descartes’s Meditations is a book designed to make you think. It is
written in the first person in what seems to be an autobiography of
six days’ thought. However, this is in fact a highly ingenious device
for encouraging the reader to follow the twists of the argument. To
read the book in the spirit in which it was written involves active
engagement with its ideas, not just passive absorption. You are invited
to become the ‘I’ in the text, moving through successive phases of
doubt and enlightenment. As philosophical literature the Meditations
remains unsurpassed and many of the ideas expressed in it have held
sway over subsequent philosophers. Descartes is usually taken to be
the father of modern philosophy.

In the Meditations Descartes sets out to establish what it is
possible to know. Consequently, his principal concern in the book
is with epistemology, the theory of knowledge. Establishing the
limits of knowledge was not a merely academic exercise: he believed
that if he could eliminate errors in his thinking and discover sound
principles for acquiring true beliefs then this would provide a bedrock
on which the edifice of scientific understanding of the world and our
place within it could be built. The dominant view in France in 1640
when Descartes wrote his Meditations was that of the Catholic
Church, which was in many ways hostile to science. Descartes was
also struggling against a tradition of scholasticism in philosophy
which tended to promote debating skills above the quest for truth.
Returning to first principles and jettisoning received opinion was a
radical move for Descartes to make in these circumstances.

Before he could begin the constructive stage of his work, Descartes
believed that he needed, once in his lifetime, to rid himself of all his
former beliefs since he was aware that many of them were false. He
thought it sensible to rid himself of all his former beliefs in one go
and then consider one by one prospective replacements for them rather
than to attempt a piecemeal repair of his belief structure. In a reply
to a critic of his work he explained this approach by means of an
analogy: if you are worried about rotten apples in a barrel you will
be well advised to tip out all the apples and examine each one before
you replace it in the barrel. Only if you are certain that the apple you
are considering is sound should you put it back in the barrel, since a
single rotten apple could contaminate all the others. This analogy
explains his method of radical doubt, often known as the Method of
Cartesian Doubt (‘Cartesian’ being the adjective from ‘Descartes’).

CARTESIAN DOUBT
The Method of Doubt involves treating all your former beliefs as
if they were false. You should only believe something if you are
absolutely certain that it is true: the slightest doubt about its truth
should be sufficient to reject it. The fact that you can doubt it doesn’t
prove that it is false; it may well turn out to be true. However, the
merest suspicion that it might be false is enough to render it unsuitable
as a foundation for the edifice of knowledge. That has to be built on
indubitable knowledge. Obviously this method is not a practical one
for day-to-day living, as Descartes himself recognised; he advocated
it as a once in a lifetime exercise. The point of this method was that
it might allow Descartes to discover some beliefs which were immune
from doubt and which would thus serve as foundations for his
reconstruction of knowledge on sound principles. At worst it would
show him that everything could be doubted; that nothing was certain.

THE EVIDENCE OF THE SENSES
In the First Meditation Descartes introduces this Method of Doubt
and applies it rigorously to his former beliefs, beginning with those
he has acquired through the five senses. His senses have sometimes
deceived him. For instance, he has made mistakes about what he could
see in the distance. On the principle that it is wise never to trust what
has once deceived you, he resolves not to trust the evidence of his
senses. But, despite sometimes being deceived about objects in the
distance, surely he couldn’t be deceived about some facts acquired
through the senses, such as that he is sitting in front of a fire in a
dressing gown holding a piece of paper?

Descartes’s response to this is that, on the contrary, he might be
mistaken even about something so apparently certain as this. Since
in the past he had dreamt that he was sitting by the fire when in fact
he was lying in bed asleep, he can’t be sure that he is not now
dreaming. But even in dreams things such as heads, hands, eyes and
so on appear, which must be likenesses of things in the real world.
So surely we can be certain that these types of object exist. The
existence of more abstract notions such as size, shape and extension
(by which he means the quality of taking up space) seems even more
certain. Whether you are asleep or awake, 2 + 3 = 5 and a square never
has more than four sides. These things do indeed seem certain. But
Descartes shows all these to be only apparent certainties. To do so
he uses the thought experiment of the evil demon.

THE EVIL DEMON
What if there is a powerful and malicious demon who constantly
manipulates what you experience and understand? Every time you
look at an object in the world what is really happening might be that
the demon is producing an illusory experience which you take to be
reality but which is really his creation. If you find this difficult to
imagine, think of what would happen if someone plugged you into
a very sophisticated virtual reality machine without your realising
what was going on. Now every time you add 2 and 2 together it
comes to 5. But how can you be sure that this isn’t because the evil
demon, or the operator of the virtual reality machine, is tricking
you? Perhaps the demon has introduced a ‘bug’ into your calculations
so that you always get the wrong result. This might sound far-
fetched, but that doesn’t affect Descartes’s argument. All that is
important is that it is possible that you are now being deceived. If
you apply the Method of Cartesian Doubt, the slightest possibility
that your belief is false provides sufficient doubt for you to reject it.
In everyday life, of course, we need much stronger evidence of the
falsity of a fundamental belief before we will so readily jettison it,
and that is as it should be. But when we are searching for a belief
which is immune from doubt, the thought experiment of the evil
demon provides a very strong test. Any belief which can pass this
test, which you are sure hasn’t been misleadingly implanted by the
demon, must be certain indeed.

At this stage in his Meditations Descartes is tempted to believe
that absolutely everything can be doubted. However, in the Second
Meditation his doubt is revealed as pre-emptive. That is, he is push-
ing sceptical arguments to their very limit so as to demonstrate that
there are some beliefs about which it is not possible to be sceptical.
Another way of putting this is that he sets out to beat the sceptics at
their own game: giving the strongest form of sceptical argument he
can imagine and then showing that it would not prevent him from
establishing at least one certainty.

The certainty which he discovers, the turning point in his
philosophy, has come to be known as the Cogito, from the Latin Cogito
ergo sum (‘I think, therefore I am’), although it doesn’t occur in the
Meditations in quite this form. In the Meditations he says ‘I am,
I exist, is necessarily true, every time I express it or conceive of it in
my mind.’

THE COGITO
Descartes’s point is that even if the evil demon does actually exist
and is constantly deceiving him, there is still something about which
he cannot be tricked, namely his own existence. It is impossible for
him, Descartes, to doubt his own existence; and Descartes believes
that his readers, on reflection, will come to the same conclusion about
their own existence. Any thought that you have indicates that you,
the thinker, exist. This is true even if you are completely confused
about the content of your thought. You might think you are standing
on the top floor of the Empire State Building admiring the view when
in fact you are waiting on a station platform in Sidcup, but that doesn’t
matter: as long as you are having a thought at all, then this shows
that you must exist.

Notice that the ‘I’ that Descartes believes he has shown to exist
whenever he is thinking is not to be identified with his body. At this
stage he can still raise all his former doubts about whether or not his
body actually exists, or exists in the form he thinks it does. Only
thinking is inseparable from his existence. The most that he can show
from the Cogito is that he is essentially a thinking thing.

CARTESIAN DUALISM
Descartes’s belief that he can be more certain of the existence of
himself as a thinking thing than as a body suggests a division between
the mind and the body. The mind is the real Descartes (or whoever)
whose body may or may not exist. The mind can outlive the body.
This sharp separation between mind and body has come to be known
as Cartesian Dualism. Descartes believes that mind and body, although
in principle separable, interact, and consequently his view is sometimes
also known as interactionism.

THE WAX EXAMPLE
Descartes describes a piece of wax taken from a honeycomb: it still
has a faint taste of honey, smells of flowers, and is hard and cold. As
he puts it close to the fire its taste and smell are lost and its colour,
shape and size all change. It becomes liquid and hot to the touch. The
point of this example is to demonstrate that although we might think
that we get an understanding of what the wax is via our sensory
experience of it, in fact all the information we get about the wax in
this way can change. Yet it remains the same piece of wax despite
the changes. Descartes’s explanation of how this is possible is that
understanding the essence of the wax, what it is that makes it this
piece of wax and not another thing, involves a judgement which goes
beyond sensory experience. And this judgement, which is a thought,
once again demonstrates to Descartes the greater certainty he has
about his own existence as a thinking thing than about the nature
and existence of the material world. This example reveals Descartes’s
rationalism, that is, his belief that we can acquire knowledge of the
nature of the world by reason alone, a view which contrasts sharply
with empiricism, which in its strongest form is the view that all our
knowledge of the world must be acquired via the senses.

GOD
The Cogito is the first step that Descartes takes towards rebuilding
the edifice of knowledge that he demolished with his Method of
Doubt. From this point onwards he is entirely constructive. Yet at
first it seems that he won’t be able to get beyond the conclusions that
he exists just so long as he is thinking, and that he is in essence a
thinking thing. Such a position would be little better than the
whirlpool of doubt that he felt himself drawn into at the end of
the First Meditation.

However, Descartes has a strategy to avoid getting trapped at
the Cogito. He undertakes to prove God’s existence and to prove that
God would not deceive us. He uses two arguments to do this, the so-
called Trademark Argument and the Ontological Argument, which
appear in the Third and Fifth Meditations respectively. Both
arguments are controversial, and were thought so even in his day.

The Trademark Argument
Descartes points out that he had an idea of God in his mind. This
idea must have come from somewhere since something can’t come
from nothing. Moreover, he thinks that there must be as much reality
in any effect as in its cause: in this case the idea is the effect and the
cause presumed to be God. Although Descartes didn’t use the analogy,
it is as if God had left a trademark on his work revealing his existence.
This is a variant of a traditional argument for God’s existence known
as the Cosmological Argument.

Descartes’s idea of God was that of a benevolent being, and such
a God would not want to deceive humankind in a systematic way.
Deception is a mark of malice, not of benevolence. Consequently,
Descartes concludes that God exists and is no deceiver. The result of
this is that he has confidence that whatever he perceives clearly and
distinctly must be true. God would not have created us in such a way
that we would feel certain when misled. The notion that whatever
he perceives clearly and distinctly must be true plays a crucial role
in the constructive phase of Descartes’s philosophy.

The Ontological Argument
In the Fifth Meditation Descartes presents a version of what is known
as the Ontological Argument. This is an a priori argument for God’s
existence, which means that it is not based on any evidence acquired
through the senses, but rather on analysis of the concept of God. The
interior angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees. This conclusion
follows logically from the concept of ‘triangle’. It is an aspect of the
essence of a triangle that the sum of its interior angles is 180 degrees.
Similarly, according to Descartes, it follows from the concept of God
as a supremely perfect being that he exists. It is part of God’s essence
that he exists. If God didn’t exist, then he wouldn’t be a supremely
perfect being: existence is, according to Descartes, one of his
perfections. So it follows from the concept of God alone that he
necessarily exists.

BEYOND DOUBT
Once Descartes has established to his satisfaction that God exists and
is not a deceiver, he begins to reconstruct the material world. He still
has to explain the fact that his senses at least on occasion deceive him,
and address the question of whether he can ever be sure that he is
not dreaming. He can be sure that he, that is, his mind, is intimately
attached to a particular body (his own), since God would not deceive
him about the existence of something which he perceives so clearly
and distinctly. But what about the material world which he seems to
see, touch, taste, smell and hear?

His commonsense beliefs about the world are all derived from his
ideas. When he sees a tower in the distance, for example, and per-
ceives it as round, he has an idea of the round tower. Before reflecting
on it, he assumes that objects in the world exist and resemble the
ideas they cause. However, the case of optical illusions makes clear
that he can have an idea of an object which gives the object different
properties from those it actually possesses. The tower, for example,
may in fact be square. Descartes’s conclusion by the Sixth Meditation
is that the existence of a God who is no deceiver guarantees that there
are objects in the material world but that it would be foolish simply
to accept all the evidence of the senses since they obviously do deceive
on occasion. A benevolent God would not, however, have created us
in such a way that we were systematically deceived about the existence
of objects. Moreover, he has certainly provided us with the means to
make accurate judgements about the nature of the world. But it does
not follow that the objects in the world are exactly like our ideas of
them. We can make mistakes about qualities such as the size, shape
and colour of things. Ultimately if we want to understand what the
world is really like we need to resort to a mathematical and geometrical
analysis of it.

In the sceptical phase of the Meditations one of the most powerful
arguments Descartes used was that we might be dreaming and unable
to recognise that we were doing so. In the Sixth Meditation he declares
that we do have at least two ways of telling dreams from waking life.
Memory can never connect dreams up one with another as it can in
waking life: the different stages of our life fit into a coherent pattern
of memory, whereas our dream life does not cohere in the same way.
The second way of telling a dream from waking life is that strange
phenomena occur in dreams that do not occur in normal life: for
instance, if someone were to vanish into air before my eyes as I was
talking to him then I would have a very strong suspicion that I was
dreaming.

CRITICISMS OF MEDITATIONS

Does he call everything into doubt?
Although the Method of Doubt seems to raise doubts about every-
thing that could possibly be doubted, this is not the case. Descartes
relies on the accuracy of his memory, for instance, never doubting
that he has dreamt in the past, or that his senses have deceived him
on occasion; he does not doubt that the meanings he associates with
particular words are the same as they were when he last used them.

However, this is not a serious problem for Descartes. Cartesian
Doubt remains a strong form of scepticism: he only undertook to
doubt what it was possible for him to doubt. Stronger forms of
scepticism might have undermined his power to do philosophy at all.

Criticism of the Cogito
One criticism sometimes made of Descartes’s Cogito, particularly
when it is given in the form ‘I think, therefore I am’, is that it
assumes the truth of the general statement ‘All thoughts have
thinkers’, an assumption which Descartes never attempts to establish
or make explicit. This criticism is based on the assumption that
Descartes was presenting the conclusion ‘I am’ as the result of a
logically valid inference of the following kind:

All thoughts have thinkers
There are thoughts now
So the thinker of these thoughts must exist.

However, this criticism does not affect the Cogito as presented in the
Meditations since there is no suggestion there that there is a logical
inference; rather Descartes seems to be advocating introspection on
the part of the reader and challenging him or her to doubt the truth
of the assertion ‘I am, I exist.’

Cartesian Circle
Once Descartes has established his own existence as a thinking thing
by means of the Cogito, the whole of his reconstructive project
depends upon two foundations: the existence of a benevolent God
and the fact that whatever we believe clearly and distinctly is true.
Both are in themselves contentious. However, there is a more
fundamental charge which is often raised against Descartes’s strategy,
namely that when he argues for the existence of God he relies on the
notion of clear and distinct ideas; and when he argues for the doctrine
of clear and distinct ideas he presupposes the existence of God. In
other words he argues in a circle. Both the Trademark and the
Ontological Arguments for God’s existence presuppose an idea of God
that Descartes knows to be accurate because he perceives it clearly
and distinctly: without the idea of God neither argument could begin.
On the other hand, the doctrine of clear and distinct ideas being true
relies entirely on the supposition that a benevolent God exists and
so would not allow us to be systematically deceived. So the argument
is circular.

Some of Descartes’s contemporaries noted this problem at the
heart of Descartes’s project; it has come to be known as the Cartesian
Circle. It is a powerful criticism of the whole constructive enterprise
in the Meditations, and there is no obvious way for Descartes to escape
it, short of finding an alternative justification for his belief in God,
or else an independent justification for his belief that whatever he
perceives clearly and distinctly is true. Nevertheless, his sceptical
arguments and the Cogito retain all their force even if the charge of
circularity holds.

Criticisms of arguments for God’s existence
Even if Descartes could somehow escape the charge of circularity, the
two arguments that he uses to establish God’s existence are
notoriously vulnerable to criticism.

First, both arguments rely on the assumption that we all have
within us an idea of God which is not simply derived from early
indoctrination. This assumption can be challenged.

Second, the Trademark Argument relies on a further assumption,
namely that there must be at least as much reality in the cause of
something as is present in the effect. This assumption is needed for
Descartes to move from the reality of his idea of God to the reality
of God. But this assumption too can be challenged. For example,
today’s scientists can explain how life evolved from inanimate matter:
we don’t find it obvious that life can only be caused by living things.

The Ontological Argument is particularly unconvincing as a proof
of God’s existence. It seems like a logical trick, an attempt to define
God into existence. The most serious criticism of it is that it assumes
that existence is just another property, like being all-powerful, or
benevolent, rather than what it is: the condition of having these
properties at all. A further problem with the Ontological Argument
is that it seems to allow us to conjure into existence all kinds of entities.
For instance, I have in my mind an idea of the perfect philosopher;
but it seems absurd to say that because I have an idea of such a
philosopher that philosopher must therefore exist on the grounds that
(arguably) a non-existent philosopher could not be perfect.

Dualism is a mistake
Descartes’s mind/body dualism finds few supporters amongst present-
day philosophers. One of the most serious problems it raises is that
of explaining how interaction between an immaterial mind and a
physical body is possible. Descartes was aware of the difficulty and
even went so far as to identify a place in the brain, the pineal gland,
where he thought mind/body interaction took place. But locating
where it occurs does not solve the difficulty of how something that
is non-physical can bring about changes in the physical world.

Generally, some form of monism, that is, a theory which says that
there is only one kind of substance (the physical), rather than a
dualistic theory (which says there are two sorts of substance), seems
to raise fewer difficulties, even though the task of explaining the
nature of human consciousness remains an intractable one.

GLOSSARY
a priori: knowable independently of sense-perception.
Cartesian: the adjective from ‘Descartes’.
Cartesian Circle: the name sometimes given to a particular diffi culty
  with Descartes’s system. Clear and distinct ideas are reliable sources
  of knowledge because they are vouchsafed by a benevolent God
  who is no deceiver; but God’s existence is only proved by relying
  on the knowledge given from clear and distinct ideas. So Descartes
  is caught in a vicious circle.
Cartesian Doubt: Descartes’s sceptical method in which, for the
  purposes of his argument, he treats as if false any belief about
  which he is not absolutely certain.
Cogito: Latin for ‘I think’; short for ‘Cogito ergo sum’, which is
  usually translated as ‘I think, therefore I am.’ However, since
  according to Descartes at this stage of his argument I can only be
  sure of my existence while I am actually thinking, it is probably
  better translated as ‘I am thinking, therefore I exist.’
Cosmological Argument: an argument which purports to demonstrate
  God’s existence. It usually takes the form: there must have been
  a first cause of everything that exists; that uncaused cause was
  God.
dualism: the view that there are two sorts of fundamentally different
  substances in the world: mind or soul and body or matter.
  empiricism: the view that knowledge of the world comes from sensory
  input rather than being innate and discoverable by reason alone.
epistemology: the branch of philosophy that deals with knowledge
  and its justification.
interactionism: the view that mind and body interact with each other:
  events in the mind bring about events in the body and vice versa.
monism: the view that there is only one type of substance in the
  universe (a view incompatible with dualism).
Ontological Argument: an argument which purports to prove God’s
  existence on the basis of the definition of God as a perfect being.
  A perfect being which didn’t exist wouldn’t be totally perfect; so
  God must exist.
rationalism: a philosophical approach which contrasts with empiricism.
  Rationalists believe that important truths about the nature of
  reality can be deduced by reason alone, without the need for
  observation.
scepticism: philosophical doubt.
Trademark Argument: an argument that Descartes uses to attempt to
  prove God’s existence. We have an idea of God in our minds. But
  where did this idea come from? It must have been implanted there
  by God as a kind of trademark.
