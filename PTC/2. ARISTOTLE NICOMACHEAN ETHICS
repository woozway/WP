ARISTOTLE
NICOMACHEAN ETHICS

Aristotle was a practical man. Though taught by Plato, he rejected
his teacher’s idea that reality lay beyond the everyday world in
the realm of the Forms. He did not believe in Plato’s myth of the
Cave. In Raphael’s painting The School of Athens (1511), Plato
points skywards to the Forms; Aristotle, in contrast, reaches forward
into the world. His studies went far beyond what we now think
of as philosophy: he was, for example, one of the first great biologists.
In philosophy his interests were wide-ranging, taking in metaphysics,
ethics, politics and aesthetics.

Despite the fact that his Nicomachean Ethics is only a collection
of lecture notes, is uneven in style, obscure in places, and was
certainly never intended for publication, it remains one of the most
important works in the history of ethics. Here Aristotle asks one
of the fundamental questions for all human beings, ‘How should
we live?’, a question which was at the heart of ancient ethical
discussions, but has been sadly neglected by twentieth-century phil-
osophers. His answer, though complex, and in places bizarre, is
important, not just as a landmark in the history of civilisation, but
also as a significant influence on current philosophical debate.

The Nicomachean Ethics is a dense and complex work, and
scholars quibble about its precise interpretation; nevertheless, the
central themes are easy enough to follow. Some of the key terms
Aristotle used do not translate easily into English. In fact most
philos ophers who discuss Aristotle have found it more straight-
forward to use transliterations of a number of the Greek words rather
than rely on confusing English near equivalents. One of the most
important of such terms is eudaimonia.

EUDAIMONIA : A HAPPY LIFE
Eudaimonia is often translated as ‘happiness’, but that can be very
misleading. It is sometimes also translated as ‘flourishing’, which,
although slightly awkward, has more appropriate connotations: it, for
instance, suggests the analogy between the flourishing of plants and
the flourishing of human beings. Aristotle believes that we all want
eudaimonia, by which he means that we all want our lives to go well.
A eudaimon life is a life that is successful. It is the kind of life that
if we could achieve it we would all choose; the kind of life we would
want for those we love. Eudaimonia is always pursued as an end,
never a means to an end. We may seek money, for instance, because
it provides a means to buy expensive clothes, and we may buy
expensive clothes because we believe they will make us more attractive
to people we want to attract; we want to attract these people because
we believe that they have a capacity to make our lives go well. But
it doesn’t make any sense to ask why we want our lives to go well.
Eudaimonia can’t serve any other purpose: it is the place where this
sort of chain of explanation finishes. It doesn’t make sense to ask
‘Why pursue eudaimonia?’ since, for Aristotle, it is a conceptual truth
that this is what all human beings do. Eudaimonia is not the only
thing pursued as an end in itself; we may, for instance, listen to music,
or spend time with our children, not because we expect to get anything
further out of these activities, but because these are the ways we want
to while away our time on earth. However, in such cases, we pursue
these things because we believe, rightly or wrongly, that they are
ingredients in a eudaimon life.

One aim of the Nicomachean Ethics is to illuminate the pursuit
of eudaimonia. If we know more about what it is that we are seeking
and how it is characteristically achieved then we will be more likely
to achieve it ourselves, even if ultimately, as Aristotle believed, our
early training and current material circumstances will determine to
a great extent our capacity to follow the right path. Aristotle, unlike
many subsequent moral philosophers, was realistic about the influence
of events beyond our control on the success of our lives. He thought
that having a certain amount of money, reasonable looks, good
ancestry and children were prerequisites for any genuinely eudaimon
life. Without the benefit of such assets we may not be able to
achieve the highest state of eudaimonia, but should tailor our actions
to the particular circumstances we find ourselves in. For Aristotle
living well is not a matter of applying general rules to specific cases
so much as adapting our behaviour to the particular circumstances
of our lives.

It is, Aristotle says, a mark of intelligence only to pursue the kind
of precision appropriate to the field in which you are working.
Judgements about how to live are only true for the most part. They
don’t hold for every individual in every circumstance, so there are
no hard-and-fast rules. Ethics is not a precise subject like math-
ematics. A carpenter’s interest in a right angle is a practical one; this
is very different from a geometer’s interest. It would be a mistake to
treat ethics as anything but a practical subject with its own standards
of generality. And, as a practical subject, it aims to show us how to
become good people, not simply to provide us with a better theoretical
understanding of what the good life amounts to.

Despite believing that we all do and should pursue eudaimonia,
Aristotle was very far from being a hedonist in the sense of advo-
cating a life of sensual indulgence. He thought that those who want
nothing more than the pleasures of sex, eating and drinking lower
themselves to the level of cattle. Eudaimonia is not a blissful mental
state. It is rather an activity, a way of living, one which brings with
it its own pleasures, but which cannot be assessed in particular actions.
The whole life of an individual has to be taken into account before
we can say for certain that that person achieved eudaimonia: as
Aristotle memorably put it, one swallow doesn’t make a summer,
nor does one happy day guarantee a happy life. A tragedy towards
the end of your life could put a completely different slant on the
question of whether or not your life as a whole went well. There is,
then, some truth to the idea that we can’t call someone’s life eudaimon
until they are dead. Aristotle even considers the ways in which events
after your death can affect the assessment of whether or not your
life went well; his answer was that the fortunes of your descendants
after your death can affect your eudaimonia to a limited extent.

THE FUNCTION OF A HUMAN BEING
Aristotle thought that human beings have a characteristic function
or activity (an ergon). In other words, just as carpenters are
recognisable by their characteristic activity (making things with
wood), so human beings as a whole have a distinctive activity that
makes us what we are. The word ‘function’ suggests that human
beings were designed for a particular purpose, but this is not the
connotation that Aristotle intends. He isn’t claiming the existence of
a wise deity responsible for the construction of the species, but rather
drawing our attention to the distinctive powers that we have that
make us what we are and not something else. This human ergon can’t
be bodily growth, since that is shared with plants. Bodily growth
doesn’t distinguish a human being from a geranium. Nor could it be
capacity for perception, because other animals have that: horses, for
instance. The ergon of human beings is rational activity; this is what
is most central to our lives as human beings.

The good human being is someone who excels in this characteristic
activity. Excellence at being human involves virtuous action.
Aristotle’s conclusion is that the good life for human beings is a life
of rational virtuous activity. It is not enough to have the potential
to act virtuously. The winners at the Olympic Games are chosen only
from the competitors and not from those who might have run faster
had they entered the events. Similarly, only those who act win the
reward in life. And the reward in life is true happiness. Roses flourish
in a well-manured soil, growing strongly and flowering profusely;
human beings flourish when living lives of rational virtuous activity.
Much of the Nicomachean Ethics is taken up with spelling out what
such lives might be like, what sort of character you need in order to
live the good life. Central to this is an analysis of the virtues and how
they are acquired.

THE VIRTUES
A virtue is a feature of one’s character: a disposition to act in a certain
way in relevant circumstances. It is important to realise that the
term ‘virtue’ used today has moral connotations: to call someone
virtuous is to make a positive assessment of their moral character.
But for Aristotle, the phrase translated as ‘virtue’, ethikai aretai,
simply meant ‘excellence of character’ and had no moral implications
in our sense of ‘moral’. Being virtuous in his sense is simply possessing
and acting upon excellences of character, some of which may be
completely irrelevant to estimates of your moral worth. In fact some
commentators have even questioned the extent to which the
Nicomachean Ethics is a work of moral philosophy in the
sense that we now understand ‘moral’. Morality is usually thought
to involve at least some concern for the interests of others: it wouldn’t
make sense to say (using the present-day understanding of ‘morality’)
‘I have developed my own private morality which is entirely selfish.’
Aristotle’s main interest, however, was not in our concern for other
people but in what it takes to make a success of your own life. In
some ways the Nicomachean Ethics is like one of those practical
manuals for self-development and greater personal efficiency that are
so popular with managers today.

Aristotle describes several key virtues. Someone who is brave, for
instance, is never so overcome with fear that he cannot act in the
right way. A brave soldier will risk his own life to save his comrade
and will not be reduced to inaction by fear; a brave dissident will
stand up to government opposition and pronounce her beliefs even
though this will mean certain imprisonment and possible torture or
death. Someone who is generous will gladly give money or time to
those who need it.

Aristotle distinguishes two types of virtue: the moral and the
intellectual. Moral virtues, such as temperance, are acquired through
early training and reinforced to become a matter of habit rather than
conscious decision; intellectual virtues, such as intelligence, on the
other hand, can be taught. The moral virtues are shaped by the non-
rational elements of the individual; the intellectual virtues by the
rational. Aristotle identifies a common structure to all the virtues:
they fall between two extremes. This is the basis of his doctrine of
the Golden Mean.

THE GOLDEN MEAN
It is easiest to understand Aristotle’s notion of the Mean by
considering some of his examples. The virtue of courage lies between
two vices: a deficiency of courage is cowardice; an excess of it is
rashness. The virtue of wittiness lies between the vices of boorishness
and buffoonery; modesty between shyness and shamelessness. Notice
that wittiness and modesty are not usually considered moral virtues,
though courage might be.

A common misinterpretation of the Doctrine of the Mean is that
it is a counsel of moderation. As the mean always lies between two
extremes of behaviour, it seems that Aristotle is advocating
moderation in all things. However, just because the mean is between
over-reacting and under-reacting, it doesn’t follow that the virtuous
person always acts in a moderate way. For instance, if you were to
see someone attacking a child, a moderate reaction would clearly be
inappropriate. Aristotle’s theory, however, would probably support
aggressive intervention in such circumstances. Such behaviour would
lie between the extremes of indifference and vengeful violence.

Virtuous action is always a mean of a kind that would be chosen
by a person of practical wisdom, the phronimos. The phronimos is
sensitive to the features of particular circumstances and an excellent
judge of how to behave.

ACTION AND CULPABILITY
Aristotle is particularly interested in action rather than just behaviour.
Human beings can be said to act rather than just behave since in
many areas of our lives we have a capacity for choice; in contrast, an
ant simply behaves because it cannot deliberate on what it might or
might not do. We usually only hold individuals responsible for their
actions: if they could not help doing what they did, then it would be
strange to blame them. Aristotle distinguishes intentional actions from
two other forms of behaviour: involuntary and non-voluntary.

Involuntary behaviour results from either compulsion or ignor-
ance. For instance, if someone pushes you through a window, you
aren’t likely to be held responsible for breaking the glass, particularly
if you didn’t want to break it. If you accidentally ate a toadstool,
through ignorance, thinking it was a mushroom, this too would be
involuntary. You might well regret the outcome in both cases, but
in neither case do you have any direct control over what happens.
These things happen against your will and you would not have done
them if you could have prevented yourself from doing them. But
some forced actions are different in that they still allow you to make
a kind of choice. For instance, if the only way of saving a ship in a
gale is to jettison the cargo, then when the captain orders this to be
done it may seem that his action is voluntary in that he chooses to
perform it. However, in another sense, it is forced by the extreme
circumstances. In a different context the act of throwing your cargo
overboard would be blameworthy, but in the particular circumstances
it is forced by events.

Aristotle considers, and rejects, the idea that you could be forced
by desire for pleasure to behave in certain ways; for instance, that
your lust might compel you to become a serial seducer, and so remove
your responsibility for your actions. If you take this line, then, as
Aristotle points out, consistency demands that you shouldn’t be
praised for your good actions, since, if they arise from desire, they
are equally outside your control.

Non-voluntary or non-intentional behaviour differs from in -
voluntary or unintentional in that you do not regret it. Regret of the
consequences of unintentional behaviour shows that if you had had
full control you would not have done what you did: you would not
have let yourself be pushed through the window; or if you had had
full knowledge you would never have eaten a toadstool. It is only
external factors which led you to do what you did. If I tread on your
toe without intending to, but don’t regret my action, then my action
was non-voluntary.

AKRASIA : WEAKNESS OF WILL
Akrasia is usually translated as ‘incontinence’, a term which to most
modern readers suggests a specific and often embarrassing loss of
bodily self-control; but Aristotle meant something more general
by the word. It is the familiar situation when you know what
you should do, what would make your life more successful, yet you
stubbornly choose what you know to be the worse option. Unlike
incontinence in the medical sense, it is a voluntary action. For instance,
you might know that marital infidelity will undermine your
eudaimonia. Yet, faced with an attractive and willing adulterer, you
may be overcome by your desire for immediate pleasure and succumb
to temptation even though you are well aware that adultery will harm
your prospects of eudaimonia and even though you, like all human
beings, seek eudaimonia. You choose what you know to be worse for
you. Aristotle, influenced by Plato, sees a problem in the idea that
you might really know what would be the best course of action yet
not choose it. For Plato, if you really know the Good, that is, have
knowledge of the Form, then you automatically act in accordance
with it. According to Plato, genuine akrasia cannot exist: any apparent
instance of it must really be a case of ignorance of the Good. In contrast
Aristotle maintains that the phenomenon of akrasia does actually
occur. Those who suffer from it know in a general way that certain
types of action are not good for them, and won’t make them flourish.
They may even pay lip service to the idea that what they are doing
in a particular case is wrong; but when they do this they don’t really
feel it, but are simply reciting learnt lines. They are overcome by
their appetite and they succumb to the temptation of immediate
pleasures rather than acting in a way that is conducive to long-term
flourishing. Even though they know at some level what is good for
them, they don’t choose it because they don’t make the inference
from the general principle to the particular case.

THE CONTEMPLATIVE LIFE
Towards the end of the Nicomachean Ethics Aristotle describes the
kind of activity which he considers the most important ingredient in
a good life: theoretical or contemplative activity. Despite devoting most
of his book to questions of practical virtue with an emphasis on the
kinds of action which would bring about flourishing, he reveals that
reflecting on what you know is the supreme activity possible for human
beings. His reasoning is as follows. Since the characteristic activity of
human beings is rational activity, and since the excellence of anything
at all arises from its fulfilment of its distinctive function, then it must
be true that human excellence is achieved in rational activity.
However, only gods would be able to sustain a life of uninterrupted
philosophical contemplation; for human beings such contemplation
is a vital ingredient, but can’t constitute the whole of the good life.
Nevertheless, it is the highest form of activity open to us.

CRITICISMS OF THE NICOMACHEAN ETHICS
Human nature
The whole of Aristotle’s discussion of human excellence and character
is based on the idea that there is such a thing as human nature and
that what is most central to our humanity is our rational capacity.
There are various ways in which Aristotle’s assumptions about human
nature can be challenged.

One radical approach is to deny that there is anything which
merits the name ‘human nature’. This is the view of some existential
philosophers, such as Jean-Paul Sartre, who think that any attempt
to declare in advance what human beings must be is doomed to
failure, since we create ourselves by our choices rather than conform
to some pre-existing template.

A second way of challenging this aspect of Aristotle’s approach is
to criticise the particular account of human nature he gives and from
which he derives the rest of his conclusions. Is a capacity for rational
activity really what separates us from other animals? Why this and
not our capacity to kill each other using weapons? Or perhaps our
capacity to play musical instruments?

Incommensurability of values
For Aristotle there is one supreme form of life, the life of
contemplation, which can be measured against other forms of life
and found superior. But is this obviously so? Some philosophers have
argued that many of the things which human beings value are simply
incommensurable, that is, there is absolutely no way in which they
can be compared, no form of measurement which would allow us to
judge them comparatively. On this view, the contemplative life might
be one valuable approach to living; but the life of the active participant
in daily affairs might be another. There is no place from which we
can sit back and judge the comparative merits of the two lives and
no common currency of value in which they can be measured.

Egoistical
A further criticism of Aristotle’s ethics is that it only provides a recipe
for an individual’s eudaimonia and shows no concern for the well-
being of other people. It is an egoistical approach teaching its readers
how to pursue their own best interests.

One response to this sort of criticism is that it simply fails to
appreciate what the ancient Greeks understood by ethics. Individual
character development was precisely the focus of Greek ethics.

Another response is that the virtues Aristotle champions are, for the
most part, precisely those needed by individuals if a society is to
flourish.

Virtues seem arbitrary
From our perspective, the particular portfolio of virtues that Aristotle
put together in the Nicomachean Ethics can be seen as a product of
his environment. Aristotle did not challenge the status quo, but rather
enshrined the pre-existing values of his society in the form of a
philosophical treatise. For instance, he thought slavery an acceptable
practice. His is a defence of the values esteemed by the nobility of
ancient Athens. Yet he presents these values as if they were obviously
part, not just of an ancient Athenian’s nature, but of human nature
itself. He treats them as universal features of the human condition,
albeit adaptable to particular circumstances.

However, the choices and omissions of virtues and vices appear
arbitrary to many readers. Why, for instance, has he nothing to say
about sympathy or altruism? His account of virtuous activity looks
parochial. And if it is parochial, its relevance to present-day moral
theorising must be diminished.

Elitism
Furthermore, Aristotle’s theory is unashamedly elitist in several ways.
First, there is no sense that eudaimonia is available to everyone: you
need good looks, children, a moderate income and a certain amount
of good luck. Unlike many moral theories, with Aristotle’s there
is no presumption that you can achieve the highest state by will
power alone. External factors determine whether or not you lead
a good life. Second, if we are to take seriously the suggestion that the
good life is a life dominated by philosophical contemplation, then it
is clear that only those fortunate enough to have time on their hands
to engage in this sort of thought can lead a supremely good life.

Aristotle would not have been bothered by the charge of elitism.
However, it is an important feature of his theory and needs to be
made explicit. Many present-day readers will feel that in its elitist
elements the theory fails to capture something important about the
nature of morality.

Vagueness
Perhaps the most telling criticism of a theory explicitly intended to
help us become better people is its vagueness about precisely how we
are to behave. The doctrine of the Mean doesn’t provide much in the
way of guidance. To say that we should act as the phronimos would
act is uninformative unless we happen to have a phronimos with us
to ask what he would do in the circumstances. Even within the theory
there seems to be a conflict: are we supposed to commit ourselves to
a life of virtuous action (the view which Aristotle expresses through
large sections of the Nicomachean Ethics), or are we supposed to
aim at one which includes substantial philosophical contemplation,
the way of life endorsed towards the end of the book? Scholars try
to reconcile these apparently opposed views, but it cannot be denied
that Aristotle conspicuously fails to provide clear guidelines about
how to live.
