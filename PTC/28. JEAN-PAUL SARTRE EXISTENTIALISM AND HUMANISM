JEAN-PAUL SARTRE
EXISTENTIALISM AND
HUMANISM

Abandonment, anguish, despair: these are the key concepts in Jean-
Paul Sartre’s public lecture ‘L’Existentialisme est un humanisme’
(literally ‘Existentialism is a humanism’). The lecture, first delivered
in Paris in October 1945, and later translated and published as the
short book Existentialism and Humanism, is probably his most read
philosophical work. He later regretted its publication. Yet despite its
flaws, it can still fire the imagination and offer genuine insight into
aspects of human choice and responsibility. It also serves as a bridge
to his more complex work Being and Nothingness.

Sartre delivered his lecture on existentialism in the wake of the
Nazi occupation of Paris. This was a time when people who might
otherwise have led relatively uneventful lives had just emerged from
a situation in which they could not avoid issues of integrity, betrayal
and commitment, in relation to the occupation, the resistance
movements and the Vichy government. Sartre had himself been a
prisoner of war before returning to occupied Paris where he spent
most of the war. Yet many of Sartre’s thoughts are still directly
relevant to anyone deciding what they want to do and be today.

WHAT IS EXISTENTIALISM?
Existentialism is a philosophical movement that exercised an influ-
ence on many of the arts as well as on philosophy and psychology.
Gabriel Marcel first coined the word ‘existentialist’ when talking
of Sartre. It took several years before Sartre was prepared to accept
this label.

Existentialists are diverse in their beliefs. In Existentialism and
Humanism Sartre suggests that what all existentialists have in com-
mon is a belief that for human beings ‘existence precedes essence’.
By this he means that there is no pre-existing blueprint for humanity;
no human nature to which we must conform. We choose what we
become. In Sartre’s version of existentialism there is no God in whose
mind our essence lies. We exist first and, through our actions, make
of ourselves what we will. In our choices we determine what sort of
a being each of us is. We are completely free to determine what we
want to become, but at the same time, as we shall see, for Sartre this
freedom carries with it an inescapable burden.

An artefact, such as a penknife, in contrast, is determined by its
function: if it won’t cut and hasn’t got a folding blade, then it isn’t
a penknife. The essence of a penknife – what makes it a penknife and
not something else – was in the mind of its maker before the knife
was made. A human being is different in that we have no pre-
determined function and no Divine Artisan as maker, in whose mind
our essence could have been determined. Unlike Aristotle, for example,
Sartre did not believe in a common human nature which could be
the basis of morality.

The emphasis on human freedom to choose what we are and what
we become is characteristic of all existentialist thinkers. Although
Sartre was an atheist, other existentialists, such as Gabriel Marcel,
have been Christians.

WHAT IS HUMANISM?
The main drive of Sartre’s lecture was to demonstrate that his own
brand of existentialism was a form of humanism. ‘Humanism’ is a
term that has many related meanings, so it is important to be clear
about how Sartre uses the word. In one sense it simply applies to
any theory that puts human beings at the centre of things. So, for
instance, the humanism of the Renaissance was characterised by
a movement away from speculation about the nature of God to a
concern with the works of humanity, especially in art and literature.
Humanism has the positive connotation of being humane. It is also
a term for secular movements – those who reject the idea that there
is a God who is the source of morality.

When Sartre declares that existentialism is a humanism, part of
what he is doing is emphasising the dignity of humanity, the centrality
of human choice to the creation of all values. It is another way of
saying that human beings create what they are and indeed create
morality. In an important sense we are responsible for what and
who we are and what we value. But he also wanted to identify
existentialism as a humanism in order to answer his critics who
caricatured his approach as a dark and dangerous pessimism about
the human psyche and human potential.

ANSWERING HIS CRITICS
Some of Sartre’s critics thought that existentialism was a philosophy
that could only lead to ‘a quietism of despair’. In other words they
thought it a philosophy of inaction, a merely contemplative
philosophy that would discourage people from committing themselves
to any course of action. Others chided the existentialists for being
overly pessimistic and for concentrating on all that is ignominious in
the human condition – Sartre quotes a Catholic critic, Mlle Mercier,
who accused him of forgetting how an infant smiles.

From other directions came the criticism that because existentialism
concentrates so much on the choices of the individual it ignores the
solidarity of humankind. It treats the individual as an island, rather
than as an integrated part of a wider society. Marxists and Christians
alike made this point. A further attack came from those who saw
existentialism as licensing the most heinous crimes in the name
of free existential choice. Since existentialists rejected the notion of
God-given moral laws, it seemed to follow that everyone could do
whatever they liked.

Sartre’s response to these criticisms focussed on his analysis of
the concepts of abandonment, anguish and despair. For Sartre these
words have specific meanings – they are technical terms and their
connotations are significantly different from those they have in
ordinary usage, though they do still draw on those connotations.
All three terms in everyday usage (in their English forms at least)
typically connote helplessness and suffering of various kinds. For
Sartre, though, they also contain an optimistic aspect, one which a
superficial reading of the text might miss.

ABANDONMENT
For Sartre ‘abandonment’ means specifically abandonment by God.
This doesn’t imply that God as a metaphysical entity actually existed
at some point, and went away. Sartre is echoing the famous
pronouncement made in Nietzsche’s Thus Spake Zarathustra: ‘God
is dead’. Nietzsche’s point was that in the late nineteenth century
belief in God was no longer tenable. By using the word ‘abandon-
ment’ in a metaphorical way Sartre emphasises the sense of loss
caused by the realisation that there is no God to underwrite our
moral choices; no divinity to give us principles that will ensure
our salvation. The choice of the word reminds us that we are alone
in the universe when seeking guidance about how we should act.

The main consequence of abandonment is the absence of any
objective source of morality. Our moral choices must be made from
a subjective position, though this did not mean for Sartre that any
arbitrary choice was as acceptable as any other, as we shall see.

Sartre objected strongly to the kind of atheistic moralist who
recognised that God didn’t exist, yet clung to a secular version of
Christian morality without the reassurance of a God to back it up.
This kind of humanist did not follow through the logical implications
of abandonment but took refuge in a kind of wishful thinking. In
contrast, the Sartrean existentialist recognises the full impact of the
non-existence of a creator. The position of someone making choices
about his or her life is one of anguish.

ANGUISH
Sartre believes wholeheartedly in the freedom of the will. He is
strongly anti-determinist about human choice. Believing that you
are forced to be one way or another is almost always a kind of self-
deception which he labels ‘bad faith’ – the denial to yourself of your
true freedom. Although he rejects the idea that humanity has any
essence, he declares that human beings are fundamentally free.
That is the core of what we are. Yet in Sartre’s almost paradoxical
phrase we are not just free, but ‘condemned to be free’. Instead of
liberation, the knowledge and experience of our own freedom to
choose our action and our attitude to the world brings with it a
weight of responsibility.

Anguish, then, is in part the recognition that we are alone without
excuses. There is no one else on whom we can blame our plight. We
are responsible for everything that we are. Obviously we can’t choose
who our parents were, where we were born, whether or not we will
die, and so on. But Sartre does go so far as to claim that we are fully
responsible for how we feel about every aspect of our situation. We
choose our emotions, and to deny this is bad faith.

Sartre goes beyond even this. Not only am I responsible for
everything that I am, but, when choosing any particular action I
inevitably act ‘as a legislator deciding for the whole of humanity’. In
Sartre’s example, if I choose to marry and to have children I thereby
commit not only myself but the whole of humanity to the practice
of this form of monogamous reproduction. This echoes Immanuel
Kant’s notion of the universalisability of moral judgements: the view
that if something is morally right for one person to do, it must also
be morally right for anyone else in relevantly similar circumstances.
For Sartre the full sense of the term ‘anguish’ becomes apparent when
we realise the implications of any of our choices. Whatever we choose,
we are painting a picture of what it is to be human. When we realise
this we will feel the tremendous responsibility of someone whose
actions have far-reaching implications for others. Like the Biblical
Abraham whom God instructed to sacrifice his only son, we are in a
state of anguish because, like him we are ‘condemned’ to choose our
actions in situations where we cannot possibly know what will happen
until it is too late to make any difference. And yet, it is as if the whole
of humanity is watching us to see what we will make of this human
life.

DESPAIR
Despair, like abandonment and anguish, is an emotive term. For
Sartre despair is simply a reaction to the obstinate character of
the world. I can desire anything, but I can’t necessarily get what I
desire. I might, for example, want to be a concert violinist, but through
no fault of my own break several fingers on my left hand, and as a
result never be able to achieve the coordination and speed needed
by a professional musician. Other people, events, circumstances can
prevent the realisation of my goals. But just because things may
not turn out the way we had hoped, Sartre does not believe that we
should abandon ourselves to inaction. Rather he urges action and
commitment, since we are simply the totality of what we actually do,
not what we might have done had circumstances been different. And
we still choose how we react to unfortunate obstacles to the
achievement of our desires.

SARTRE’S PUPIL
The central example Sartre uses in Existentialism and Humanism is
a real one. During the occupation of France one of Sartre’s pupils was
faced with a genuine moral dilemma. He had two options, as he saw
it: to stay in France to look after his mother who doted on him; or
to set off to join the Free French in England to fight for the liberation
of France. He knew that the consequences of his leaving would be
very bad for his mother; yet at the same time his attempt to join the
Free French might end in total failure and his attempt to do something
worthwhile with his life might ‘vanish like water into sand’. The stark
choice was between a son’s loyalty and the attempt to fight for the
liberation of his homeland.

Sartre begins by demonstrating that neither Christian nor
Kantian moral doctrines could guide the pupil. Christian teaching
would tell the youth to act with charity, love his neighbour and
be prepared to sacrifice himself for the sake of others. This, however,
doesn’t solve the problem, since he would still be left choosing between
love of his mother and love of his country. The Kantian ethic
teaches never to treat others as means to an end. But this doesn’t
help much either, since staying with his mother would be treating
her as an end, but at the same time treating those fighting on his
behalf as a means to an end. But if he joins the fighters, he would be
treating them as ends, but at risk of treating his mother as a means
to an end.

Here the pupil experiences the meaning of abandonment: he is
forced to make significant choices in a world without fixed pre-
ordained values. There are no simple solutions. Ultimately he is
forced to choose for himself. Even if he goes to someone for advice,
he can choose to reject that advice. And his choice of advisor would
probably to some extent be a result of his expectation of the kind of
advice he would get from them. Sartre’s advice to his pupil was
straightforward, but perhaps not particularly helpful. He left the
student bearing the full weight of the anguish of the human
predicament with the words: ‘You are free, therefore choose.’

CRITICISMS OF EXISTENTIALISM AND
HUMANISM

Overestimates human freedom
In Existentialism and Humanism, just as in his earlier book Being
and Nothingness, Sartre asserts that human beings are free and that
our free choices determine what we are. Yet, many philosophers are
sceptical of his assumption of the extent of free will (see the similar
criticism of Being and Nothingness in the previous chapter). You
needn’t be a complete determinist to believe that we have less freedom
about our emotions, for example, than Sartre suggests.

Too individualistic
Sartre’s existentialism emphasises the individual alone, responsible
for everything he or she does, not bound by any human nature or
social conventions that fix what a human being should do. Yet this
approach is atomistic. Sartre writes as if we weren’t integrated into
particular societies with resulting obligations and responsibilities.
Society shapes us, and, many believe, conditions what it is possible
for us to think and do. Sartre’s approach is unashamedly subjective:
he begins from the individual. In his later book, The Critique
of Dialectical Reason, he attempted to reconcile the individual
existentialist position with Marxism, acknowledging the social,
political and historical aspects of the human predicament which he
had underplayed in his earlier writing. Unfortunately most of that
book is almost unintelligible, perhaps because he wrote large parts of
it under the influence of amphetamines.

Why should my choices hold for all humanity?
In order to rebut his critics, Sartre needs to demonstrate that his
existentialism does not support the worst form of subjectivism, where-
by moral choices are really a matter of individual taste, and any
choice of action is as morally good as any other. If his existentialism
collapses into this position, then it would be a fair criticism of it to
point out that it has the consequence that the most horrific examples
of torture, murder and sadism are according to this theory morally
acceptable if people genuinely desire to perform them.

His argument for his version of universalisability, however, on
which the whole edifice of his argument stands, is rather weak. He
begins with the claim that when we choose to do something what we
choose is always what we believe to be the better course of action.
But then, controversially, he goes on to claim that nothing can be
better for us unless it is better for everyone. So, for Sartre, because
I choose what is in my view best for me, this somehow implies that
it must be best for everyone – presumably meaning everyone in a
similar situation. The image of humanity that I create when making
my choices must hold for anyone in an entire epoch. Thus our
responsibility is supposed to extend far beyond the individual. Yet
the swift moves in this argument from individual choice to
responsibility for the whole of humanity in an epoch, do not seem
justified or, indeed, justifiable.

The case of the sincere yet evil person
Even if Sartre’s position had been well supported, it might have some
extremely unpalatable consequences which he does not consider. For
example, take the case of a sincere yet evil person, such as Adolf Hitler.
From an existential viewpoint Hitler’s choices – his repulsive anti-
semitism, the Holocaust, his eugenics programmes – were all delivered
in good faith. Hitler’s fashioning of an image of himself did indeed
fashion an image of what humanity could be like in an epoch. An
existentialist Hitler could claim that his choices had been made in a
world without pre-existing values and that they were not just binding
on him but on the whole of humanity.

Existentialism and Humanism does provide the material for a
response to this criticism. There Sartre asserts that someone who
genuinely chooses to be free cannot not wish freedom for other people
too. Quite clearly Hitler did not respect the freedom of those who
did not agree with him. He murdered millions of Jews, homosexuals,
political opponents, Gypsies, those with severe psychiatric problems.
If Sartre’s principle is accepted then this provides a retort to the
objection that his philosophy would not provide a position from
which to judge Hitler as immoral. Yet the principle that anyone who
chooses to be free must want other people to be free only makes sense
if you assume that logically whatever you want for yourself you must
also want for other people. Sartre, however, as we have already seen,
does not provide adequate argument to move from the individual to
the whole of humanity.
