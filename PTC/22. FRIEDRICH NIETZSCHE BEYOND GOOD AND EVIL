FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE
BEYOND GOOD
AND EVIL

According to Sigmund Freud, Friedrich Nietzsche had a more
penetrating knowledge of himself than any other man who ever lived
or was ever likely to live. This deep self-knowledge is revealed in a
string of books which have stood the test of time both as literature
and as philosophy. They are idiosyncratic, fragmentary, infuriating,
and at times exhilarating. They defy simple analysis, and summaries
cannot do justice to the richness and diversity of their contents. Most
contain passages which, it must be said, are little more than the
ranting of a madman and which anticipate his eventual mental
breakdown. A shadow is cast over all of them by the fact that anti-
semites and fascists have, by selective quotation, found support for
their views in them; however, the ideas that some Nazis found so
attractive are, for the most part, caricatures of Nietzsche’s philosophy.

Beyond Good and Evil pulsates with ideas, not all of them fully
formed and some of them quite unpleasant. It is a flawed masterpiece
by an eccentric genius. Within it there are many deep phil-
osophical insights; but these sit alongside a range of misogynist
jibes, and bizarre generalisations about national character traits and
religion. Nietzsche was undoubtedly one of the most influential
philosophers of the nineteenth century. His ideas influenced a wide
range of twentieth-century thinkers, including Sigmund Freud, Jean-
Paul Sartre and Michel Foucault, but also, amongst others, the
novelists Thomas Mann and Milan Kundera. Despite his later reputa-
tion, however, in his own lifetime very few of his contemporaries
recognised the importance and significance of his work.

From summaries of this book you might imagine it a coherent
and well argued series of related theses in which Nietzsche lays
out his positions on truth, morality and psychology. This is very far
from the case. It is fragmentary and in large part difficult to paraphrase
– more a collage of thoughts than a developed argument. One whole
section consists entirely of aphorisms – short, pithy statements.
Another is a poem. The most overtly philosophical sections consist
of loosely connected mini-essays. But these are not always easy to
follow, and some are scarcely more than tirades; others could be pages
torn from a notebook, printed without editing. Yet through-
out this book any sensitive reader is likely to be struck by Nietzsche’s
brilliance.

Despite the wide-ranging nature of Nietzsche’s thinking, major
themes do emerge, most of them signalled by the section titles. Some
of these complement the ideas expressed in the book discussed in the
next chapter, On the Genealogy of Morality. Broadly, in Beyond Good
and Evil Nietzsche begins by diagnosing the shortcomings of
modernity, and moves on to outline the kind of thinking that will
allow humanity to progress. His aim is to clear the way for what he
calls ‘free spirits’: the philosophers of the future. In the great tradition
of philosophy he is concerned with truth and appearance. But he
believes that to date philosophers have failed to see things as they
are. They have been seduced by Plato’s view that there is an objective
reality beyond appearance, a world of absolute values. In contrast with
this he asserts that truth is necessarily truth from a perspective. In
place of absolute good or evil, he reveals the dark psychological origins
of everything those around him believe to have intrinsic value and
worth. His method is a diagnosis of the ills of his society. His stance
is for the most part that of an anthropologist examining the values
of the culture in which he finds himself, but not a scientific
anthropologist – more of a poet-prophet.

THE TITLE
The title of the book describes Nietzsche’s intended position: who-
ever is interested in truth will stand beyond the simple black/white
moral categories of good and evil, and will recognise morality for
what it is. Morality is an expression of the fundamental life force he
calls the Will to Power. The cherished values of his contemporaries,
far from originating in compassion and universal love, have their
deepest origins in cruelty and the desire to surpass others. The
philosophers of the future will come to recognise this. As a result
they will revalue all values.

THE WILL TO POWER
The Will to Power is the basic life force that drives us all. Nietzsche
believes that most people deny the truth about existence: for many
that is the only way they can cope with living at all. They fail to
recognise that exploitation and oppression can’t be eliminated since
these are a fundamental part of nature. It is for Nietzsche an essential
feature of life that the strong oppress the weak. This Will to Power
is the source of everything that we are. All that is valued as good or
benevolent has its beginnings in this life force. We hide from this
difficult truth, but the free spirits of the future embrace it.

ON THE PREJUDICES OF PHILOSOPHERS
Nietzsche opens Beyond Good and Evil by turning his gaze on
philosophers themselves, attacking their misplaced confidence in the
power of reason which they allege leads them to the conclusions they
hold. In a series of acid critiques, Nietzsche argues that, without
realising it, philosophers simply rationalise their prejudices: they
provide reasons for what they happen to believe already. What passes
for the product of impartial thought is really unconscious confession:
accidental autobiography. Kant’s moral philosophy, for example, is
simply his heart’s desire made abstract; Spinoza’s quasi-geometrical
‘proofs’ for his ethical philosophy mask his highly personal moral
commitments that he presents as if they were the conclusions of
neutral logic. This attack on his predecessors indirectly justifies
Nietzsche’s own more openly personal approach to writing philos -
ophy. Nietzsche’s voice is rarely neutral and transparent to what is
being said. It would be difficult to read his philosophy as the product
of a disinterested, supremely rational intellect. It also justifies the
ambition of his preface to the book, in which he sees philosophy as
it has been as something to be surpassed, a phase in history like
astrology in the progress of science.

TRUTH
One prejudice of traditional philosophers is that truth is more
important than appearance. In place of this absolute antithesis,
truth or appearance, Nietzsche substitutes the hypothesis that
there can be a spectrum of darker or lighter shades, not an absolute
black/white dichotomy, just as in a painting there are different tonal
‘values’. At times Nietzsche seems to toy with a radical subjectivism
about truth in which ‘true’ just means ‘true for me’; but most
commentators interpret his position as perspectivism. On this
account there are different perspectives on any matter, no absolute
neutral point from which to observe; yet some perspectives are
superior to others – they are not all of equal value (the position usually
taken by relativists).

A further prejudice of the philosophers is that they assume that
knowledge of the truth will produce a better outcome than a life
based on falsehoods. Nietzsche again questions this, recognising that
there can be such a thing as dangerous knowledge, knowledge that
far from being life-enhancing can be unbearable. There are many
aspects of truth from which we shy away. He includes in this
category the insight that unconscious processes can be the source of
our most revered values. Superficial falsehood may be a pre- requisite
for survival. Religion, which he takes to rest on a falsification of
reality, plays an important part for many in maintaining optimism
in the face of a world that Nietzsche believes to be ultimately explained
by the force of the Will to Power. In this thought Nietzsche echoes
Karl Marx’s famous comment about how religion acts as an opiate
for the people.

UNCONSCIOUS DRIVES
Nietzsche’s uncovering of unconscious drives influenced Freud.
Nietzsche suggests that humanity has moved beyond a pre-moral
stage (when all that matters are consequences) and through a moral
phase (where emphasis is on intentions – most obviously exemplified
in Kant’s ethics). In order to progress to the extra-moral – humanity’s
next important stage – we need to move beyond good and evil and
recognise that the value of our actions lies in unconscious rather than
conscious motivation.

RELIGION
Like Freud after him, Nietzsche believed that religion was a kind of
neurosis. In Beyond Good and Evil he attacks what he calls the
religious disposition, diagnosing in it a range of psychological
problems and hypocrisies. The values he embraces of nobility,
superiority and natural hierarchies, and of the triumph of the few
elevated geniuses who can go beyond herd morality, are completely
at odds with Christian values. Religion, then, like all other existing
value systems, is for Nietzsche something to anatomise and ultimately
to explain away. The philosophers of the future will be as beyond
religion as they are beyond the conventional moral categories which
often flow from religion.

CRITICISMS OF BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL
Anti-egalitarianism
The ideal, for Nietzsche, seems to be a strong, heroic individual
opposed to what he disparagingly describes as herd morality. He
advocates strength and free spirit. For him freedom is the prerogative
of the strong, not a right of the weak. He has no concern for the
general welfare of the majority. More than that, he seems to despise
ordinary people: in Beyond Good and Evil he comments that books
for common people are always bad-smelling, with the odour of little
people clinging to them. The only value of the herd’s existence for
Nietzsche is that it may inadvertently provide the conditions
of adversity in which genius seems to flourish. This is one aspect of
Nietzsche’s thinking that is particularly attractive to fascists, and
anyone who is inclined to believe themselves far superior to the
people around them, and so not bound by the ethical rules of the
majority. Critics of Nietzsche see him as fuelling anti-egalitarian
prejudices. His admirers, on the other hand, are inclined to praise
him for being bold enough to dismiss what they see as the myth that
everyone is of equal value.

Anti-feminist
Nietzsche’s anti-egalitarianism is perhaps most obvious in his
misogynistic comments and attacks on the idea that the sexes should
be treated equally. For Nietzsche the attempt to give women equality
with men is a sign of shallowness. In contrast with, for example, his
predecessor John Stuart Mill, who in his The Subjection of Women
made a passionate case for equality of treatment between men and
women, Nietzsche simply asserts some rather unpleasant prejudices
and suggests that it would be good if women stopped asserting their
rights to equality. Comments like these reveal what is so often
smoothed over: Nietzsche’s work is uneven and lurches between
comments of great philosophical insight and vituperative general-
isations that can fuel the thought of the worst deniers of human
equality and freedom.

Vagueness
Nietzsche’s styles of writing in this book and elsewhere leave the
reader with substantial interpretive work to do. It is rarely clear what
Nietzsche is arguing for, whether he is being ironic or earnest, for
example. Nietzsche scholars dispute at length about the interpreta-
tion of his work often generating new philosophical positions in
the process. Even Nietzsche’s basic position on truth is unclear:
is he a consistent perspectivist, or does his position collapse into
subjectivism?

The grand sweep of Nietzsche’s ideas can be exhilarating, and
inspiring. Yet the collage of thoughts that he presents is so open to
different interpretations and emphases that it is likely to frustrate
anyone looking for a simple straightforward understanding of his
major theses.

It is true that Nietzsche rarely writes with the precision or
clarity of David Hume or John Stuart Mill. But this same point
can, however, be taken as a positive one rather than a criticism.
Nietzsche’s work has a similar merit to imaginative literature, and
as such gains force from the multiplicity of possible interpretations.
His is a poetic philosophy, similar in many ways to Kierkegaard’s.
Like a work of art, Nietzsche’s books are open rather than closed:
they have the power to stimulate the reader to thoughts of his or her
own – either in support of or in reaction against the ideas they
entertain.
