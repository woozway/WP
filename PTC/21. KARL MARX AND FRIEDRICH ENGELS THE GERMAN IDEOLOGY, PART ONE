KARL MARX AND
FRIEDRICH ENGELS
THE GERMAN
IDEOLOGY, PART ONE

We are what we are as a result of our position in the economic
situation of our time; in particular, our relation to the means of
material production shapes our lives and thoughts. There is no
timeless, unchanging human nature. We are products of the historical
period in which we find ourselves. This is the message at the heart
of the first part of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels’ The German
Ideology, a book which sets out the theory of historical materialism.
Most of the book is negative, attacking almost line by line the work
of some German reinterpreters of Hegel’s philosophy, the so-called
Young Hegelians. Much of it is devoted to a discussion of Ludwig
Feuerbach, a writer who, together with Georg Hegel, exercised a
powerful influence on Marx’s intellectual development.

Most present-day readers of The German Ideology concentrate on
the positive theories set out in the first part of the book, before the
authors get immersed in the minutiae of their opponents’ work. Isaiah
Berlin’s assess ment of the book as a whole acknowledges its more
tedious aspects while justifying its status as a classic: ‘This verbose,
ill-organised and ponderous work, which deals with authors and views
long dead and justly forgotten, contains in its lengthy introduction
the most sustained, imaginative and impressive exposition of Marx’s
theory of history.’

When reading The German Ideology it is important to recognise
the radical approach that Marx and Engels advocated, an approach
encapsulated in the last of Marx’s ‘Theses on Feuerbach’, which he
wrote around the time that he was working on The German Ideology:
‘The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways;
the point is to change it.’ It is not good enough simply to recognise
that capitalism traps many people in a life of meaningless work and
impoverished home life. What is needed is a revolution: a complete
overturning of the status quo. No one can deny that Marx and Engels
succeeded in their aim of changing the world. Unlike many of the
writers discussed so far, these two managed to have a profound effect
not just on academics, but on the world at large. Almost miraculously,
their writings inspired successful revolutions, the after-effects of
which are still being felt today.

HISTORICAL MATERIALISM
Marx and Engels’ theory of historical materialism, or ‘the materialist
conception of history’, as they prefer to call it, is the theory that your
material circumstances shape what you are. ‘Materialism’ has several
uses in philosophy. In the philosophy of mind, for instance, it is the
view that the mind can be explained in purely physical terms. This
is not how Marx and Engels use it. Rather for them ‘materialism’
refers to our relationship with materials of production: at its most
basic, this amounts to the labour that we have to do in order to feed
and clothe ourselves and our dependants. In more complex societies
it takes in the property that we may or may not own and our
relationship to the means of producing wealth.

Materialism in this sense is directly opposed to the kind of
philosophy that forgets the nature of real human life and hovers
in a world of abstract generalisations. It concentrates on the harsh
realities of most human life, which perhaps explains its wide appeal.
This materialism is historical in the sense that it recognises that
material circumstances change over time, and that, for example, the
impact of a new technology can completely transform a society,
and thus the individuals who compose it. For instance, the abolition
of slavery was made possible by the invention of the steam engine,
a machine which could work harder and longer than a hundred
slaves.

DIVISION OF LABOUR
As soon as human beings begin to produce what they need to survive,
they set themselves apart from animals. The particular demands
of what they produce and how they produce it shape their lives. As
societies grow, so the social relations necessary for successful
production become more complex; the more developed a society, the
greater division of labour that occurs.

Division of labour is simply the allocation of different jobs to
different people. For example, in a very simple society each individual
might farm, hunt and build for him or herself. In a more developed
one each of these roles would be likely to be carried out by different
people.

Marx and Engels saw the extreme division of labour character-
istic of capitalist economies as a powerful negative influence on what
human life can be. It gives rise to alienation, the distancing of an
individual’s labour from his or her life. The division of labour renders
individuals powerless victims of a system that enslaves and dehuman -
ises them. This is particularly damaging when the division of physical
and intellectual labour occurs, since it reduces the chances of those
who only do harsh and tedious physical work of achieving a fulfilled
existence. More importantly, for Marx and Engels, it goes against the
common interest. The vision that Marx and Engels put in its place is
of a world in which private property has been abolished and each
individual is free to take on a number of roles in the course of a
working day. As they put it, in such a society it would be possible
for me ‘to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the
morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise
after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter,
fisher man, herdsman or critic’. This is a vision of work as a freely
chosen and fulfilling activity rather than as an enforced treadmill the
only alternative to which is starvation. Marx and Engels’ sympathies
always lie with the working-class labourer trapped in a job which is
unsatisfying; a victim of a faceless economic system.

IDEOLOGY
All religious, moral and metaphysical beliefs are as much a product
of our material relations as are any other aspects of our lives. The
dominant ideas of an age, which have traditionally been treated as
independent of class interest, are in fact nothing more than the
interests of the ruling classes writ large and rationalised. ‘Ideology’
is the word Marx and Engels use to refer to these ideas which are the
by-product of a particular economic and social system. Those who
are in the grip of ideology typically see their conclusions as being the
outcome of pure thought. In this they are simply mistaken: their ideas
are the outcome of their historical and social circumstances.

REVOLUTION
When the proletariat, that is, the class of workers who own no
property but their own labour, become sufficiently disgruntled with
their condition and with the ideologies used to suppress them,
revolution is possible. Marx and Engels were fervent advocates of
revolution: they saw it as inevitable and praiseworthy. When the
conditions of the proletariat become sufficiently impoverished and
precarious, this is the time for them to rise up and rebel against the
system that enslaves them. After the revolution, private property
would be banned, leaving the way open for communal ownership.
This vision of the future was, according to Marx and Engels, a
prediction based on hard empirical evidence about the patterns of
history and the effects of alienation. It follows directly from their
historical materialism: the way to change people’s ideas is to change
the system of material production that gives rise to them.

CRITICISMS OF THE GERMAN IDEOLOGY

Deterministic
One criticism often levelled at Marx and Engels’ historical materialism
is that it is deterministic. It does not leave any room for free will
since what we do is entirely shaped by our roles in a complex web
of causes and effects. The causes are to do with the individual’s socio-
economic position. Who and what you are is outside your control.
You are a product of the situation in which you find yourself.

This sort of criticism only makes sense if you hold that human
beings do genuinely have free will of some kind, and not just the
illusion that they have it. Marx and Engels might have been happy
to have had their theory labelled ‘determinist’, provided that it is
recognised that determinism can be a matter of degree, rather than
an ‘all or nothing’ concept. Marx and Engels clearly believed that you
could choose to revolt against an oppressive system, and that human
choices could accelerate the turning of the wheels of history. To this
extent, then, they were not complete determinists about human
behaviour.

Unrealistic vision of work
A further criticism of The German Ideology is that it paints too rosy
a picture of work in the future and fails to recognise the importance
of division of labour to the state. The idea that you could pick and
choose jobs as you felt like it in a true communist society is absurd.
Division of labour is often based on a division of skills: some people
just are better at woodwork than others, so it makes sense to let those
who are good become carpenters, and to steer the botchers into some
other task.

If I were to try to make a dining table, this could well take me
five or six times as long as it would take a carpenter to do the same
job; and anyone employing me or relying on me to produce a table
would run the risk of getting a badly made piece of furniture. The
carpenter works with wood every day and has acquired the skills
needed to make tables. I only occasionally work with wood, and never
produce anything of worth. So of course it makes sense to divide jobs
up amongst those who are best suited to them. It would be absurd
to suggest that you could be a surgeon in the morning, a train driver
in the afternoon and a professional footballer in the evening.

It is ideological itself
Marx and Engels’ theory cannot escape being ideological. If the theory
is correct, then the theory itself must be a product of the system of
material production in which it arose. It might seem as if the theory
is purely the outcome of rational thought about the nature of history
and of work, but this is an illusion. It is the consequence of an
industrial economy in which large numbers of people were employed
on low wages doing jobs which gave them little control over their
lives.

Marx and Engels would no doubt happily accept that their own
theories were ideological, so drawing attention to their ideological
nature doesn’t necessarily undermine their approach. Presumably
what distinguishes their work from the bourgeois ideologies they were
so keen to expose is that theirs is an expression of a proletariat
ideology. Their views serve the interests of the working class and so
redress the balance.

Nevertheless, if we accept that the views expressed in The German
Ideology are themselves ideological, this does have the con sequence
that it would be a mistake to expect them to hold for all human beings
in all material circumstances. As societies, and in particular the modes
of material production, change, so must philosophical theories about
human nature and society.

Incites revolution
The German Ideology, like many works by Marx and Engels, did not
stop short of advocating revolution. It was intended to change the
world, not simply describe it. Some critics see this as a step too far.
You can recognise the deficiencies of the current system without
suggesting that it needs to be overthrown by force. Revolution causes
bloodshed. The cost of revolution in human terms can outweigh any
benefits that would ensue from its having taken place. Add to this
the very high risk of failure, and the revolutionary aspects of Marx
and Engels’ thought can seem irresponsible.

This criticism does not undermine their arguments so much as
question the morality of advocating revolution. Only if the com-
munist ideal could genuinely be achieved would the human cost of
a revolution be worth paying. The historical evidence of recent decades
is that the ideal is not so easy to achieve, let alone maintain, as many
of its admirers believe.
