JOHN STUART MILL
ON LIBERTY

My freedom to swing my fist ends where your face begins. That, in
essence, is the message of Mill’s On Liberty. The only ground for
preventing me from doing what I want to do, or forcing me to do
something against my will, is that someone else would be harmed by
my actions. My private life is my business, and as long as I don’t
actually harm anyone else by what I do, then it is not for the state
or society to interfere. Anyone who has reached adulthood and is
capable of making informed decisions should be free to pursue their
version of the good life without any interference. Even if I harm
myself through my actions, this isn’t sufficient grounds for state
intervention. I can, for example, decide to neglect my physical health
and degenerate into a couch potato, and should be free to do this.
Paternalism, that is, controlling what people do on the grounds that
you know better than they do what is good for them, is only justified
towards children and those who, because of mental illness, are
incapable of making responsible decisions for themselves. Mill also,
more controversially, believes that paternalism is justified towards
‘uncivilised’ peoples who are incapable of judging what is best for
them. The rest of us, however, should be given a free rein because
that’s the best way of increasing the overall level of happiness in the
world.

AUTHORSHIP
Although On Liberty is always referred to as by John Stuart Mill, in
his introduction to the book and in his autobiography he em-
phasises that it was in fact co-written with his wife, Harriet Taylor,
who died before it was finished. Historians of philosophy dispute the
degree of influence she had on the content of the finished book, but
it is clear that Mill himself saw her role as co-author (though he didn’t
go so far as to include her name on the title page).

THE HARM PRINCIPLE
In his autobiography Mill describes On Liberty as ‘a kind of
philosophic textbook of a single truth’. The single truth is usually
known as the Harm Principle or the Liberty Principle. This is the idea
outlined above that potential harm to other people is the only
acceptable ground for preventing me from doing whatever I want to
do. This is very different from arguing for unlimited freedom. Mill
thought that life in society would be impossible without imposing
some restrictions on freedom: the question he addressed was where
to draw the line between what should and should not be tolerated.

The Harm Principle is underpinned by Mill’s commitment to
utilitarianism, the view that the right action in any circumstances is
determined by assessing its consequences: whatever is likely to give
rise to the greatest happiness just is the morally right thing to do
(though not all types of happiness are given equal weight in Mill’s
calculation). Mill argues that if individuals are allowed space to
pursue what interests them, the whole society benefits. I know
better than other people the sort of life that is best for me. Even if
I’m mistaken about this, choosing for myself is probably preferable
to being forced to accept someone else’s conception of the good
life ‘off the peg’. Mill believes that a situation in which individuals
are allowed to pursue a wide range of incompatible lifestyles is
far preferable to one in which they are coerced into a pattern of
social conformity. He is an empiricist, and as such believes that the
way to discover the truth on most matters is by experiment. Only
by trying out different solutions to the human predicament will
a society flourish; this was the route to social improvement. He
approved of what he called ‘experiments of living’. In contrast,
unthinking conformity leads to stagnation and a cramping of choice,
the net result of which is misery and a stunting of human potential.
It is important to realise that Mill is not arguing that we all have a
natural right to liberty: he does not believe that the idea of natural
rights makes sense at all. For convenience we might talk about a ‘right’
to freedom, but, for Mill, this must always be translatable into a
generalisation about what is most likely to promote happiness.
Utilitarianism rather than a natural rights theory underpins the
policies of On Liberty.

On Liberty is partly directed at those who want to impose laws to
restrict what consenting adults do in private (and consequently it
has in recent years provided intellectual support for law reform on
such issues as film censorship and homosexuality). But it is also
directed at what Mill called ‘the tyranny of the majority’, the way
that social pressures imposed by majority views can prevent some
people from carrying out experiments of living even though there is
no law which prohibits them from doing so. If my neighbours are
affronted by the eccentric way I choose to live, even if nothing I do
directly harms them, they may well make my life intolerable and
thereby effectively prevent me from exercising the freedom I have
within the law. The social pressure to conform can, Mill believed,
undermine freedom and level everyone down to an unthinking
mediocrity that is in the end worse for all.

This brings out clearly a point that some people who want to use
Mill’s Harm Principle find convenient to ignore, namely that merely
causing offence to other people doesn’t count as harming them. If
you are offended by the knowledge that I choose to live in an
unconventional way, with several homosexual partners, or as a nudist,
perhaps, or maybe as a transvestite, then that doesn’t provide sufficient
grounds for coercing me by law or by social pressure to behave
otherwise. Mill’s principle would have been completely implausible
if it had allowed offence to count as harm since almost every style
of life is found offensive by someone or other. What exactly Mill
does mean by ‘harm’ is not always clear and has been the focus of
much discussion; but he is explicit in rejecting the idea that causing
offence to others counts as harm. The sort of toleration that Mill
advocates does not mean that you have to approve of other people’s
eccentric life choices. You are entitled to be disgusted by how
others live. You can try to educate them into making better choices;
and the state is justified in imposing an education system on children
that will make them less likely to pursue self-destructive lives as
adults. But your disgust at the way other adults have chosen to
live is never on its own enough to justify any intervention forcing
them to behave differently. A mark of a civilised society is that it can
tolerate diversity.

Mill’s principle is not meant to be an abstract philosophical ideal
with no relevance to real life. He wants to change the world for the
better. To that end he focuses on applications of the principle. The
most important of these is his discussion of freedom of thought and
discussion, usually known as freedom of speech.

FREEDOM OF SPEECH
Mill is a passionate defender of free speech. He argues that thought,
speech and writing should only ever be censored when there is a
clear risk of incitement to violence. The context in which words are
uttered or written can affect their dangerousness. As Mill pointed
out, it would be acceptable to print in a newspaper the view that corn-
dealers starve the poor. However, if the same words were spoken to
an angry mob outside a corn-dealer’s house then we would have good
grounds for silencing the speaker. The high risk of inciting a riot would
justify the intervention. Today’s debates about freedom of speech
often focus on pornography or on racism; for Mill, writing in the
nineteenth century, the central concern was with writing or speech
which criticised orthodox views in religion, morality or polit-
ics. He thinks that greater damage is caused by suppressing a view,
even if that view is false, than by allowing it to be freely expressed.
In On Liberty he gives a detailed justification of this stance.

If someone expresses a controversial opinion, there are two basic
possibilities: that the view is true, or that it is false. There is also
a less obvious third possibility: that, though false, it contains an
element of truth. Mill considered each of these possibilities. If the
view is true, then suppressing it involves denying us the opportun-
ity of ridding ourselves of error. His assumption is that truth is
better than falsehood. If the view is false, then to silence it without
giving it a hearing undermines the possibility of providing a public
refutation of the view in which, he believes, truth would be seen to
be victor in its collision with error. So, for example, Mill would
tolerate the expression of racist opinions, provided that they did
not incite violence, because they can then receive a public refutation
and be demonstrated to be false (assuming that the views were
indeed false).

If the view expressed contains an element of truth, silencing it can
prevent the true part becoming known. For example, a racist might
point to the fact that members of a particular ethnic group on average
left school with fewer qualifications than the norm. The racist might
take this as evidence that members of that ethnic group were innately
inferior. However, even though this view is very probably false, the
evidence might contain some truth: the truth here might be that
members of this ethnic group do actually leave school with fewer
qualifications. The true explanation of the evidence might be that they
are discriminated against by the education system, not that they are
innately inferior. Mill thinks that by silencing opinions that you are
convinced are false you run the risk of overlooking the fact that even
false opinions can contain elements of truth.

In order to silence a view you must be confident of your own
infallibility (inability to make mistakes). But none of us can have
complete confidence in this respect. No human being is immune from
mistakes about what is true. History is brimming with examples
of truth being suppressed by people who genuinely believed the
suppressed view to be misguided nonsense. Think of the suppression
by the Church of the view that the earth goes round the sun rather
than vice versa. Galileo and his followers were persecuted for their
beliefs; their persecutors were convinced that their own views were
correct.

But surely censors are justified in making judgements on the basis
of probability? They may not be infallible, but in some cases surely
they can be almost certain that they are right? There are very few
issues on which we can achieve absolute certainty: won’t a demand
for certainty paralyse us into inaction? Mill’s response to this is that
allowing others the freedom to contradict us is one of the principal
ways in which we gain confidence in our judgements. We can be more
confident about a view which survives scrutiny and criticism than
one which has never been challenged. Besides, even if a view is
obviously true, the act of defending it against false views keeps the
true view alive and prevents it from becoming a dead dogma incapable
of stirring anyone to action.

CRITICISMS OF ON LIBERTY

Religious objections
Despite the fact that Mill was very keen to promote religious
toleration, his views on liberty are sometimes attacked on religious
grounds. Some religions teach that part of the state’s role is to enforce
the God-given moral code. For members of such religions it may be
inconceivable that they could be misled about their religious duty.
If, for example, you are a member of a religion which dictates that
all homosexual activity is a sin, and your religion is the official state
religion, then you may believe that the state should prohibit all
homosexual activity despite the fact that it does no direct harm to
anyone. Whether or not this prohibition would be conducive to
happiness is irrelevant, you might think. In contrast, Mill would argue
that because this prohibition would tend to decrease happiness and
restrict human potential it should not be imposed. The two views are
in such direct contradiction that there is no obvious compromise
between them.

Vague notion of harm
The Harm Principle provides the core of On Liberty, but Mill is
vague about what he means by harm. He rules out being offended
as not counting as being harmed. However, at one point in the
book he allows that some acts which are permissible and harmless in
private (presumably he is thinking of sexual acts) should be prevented
from taking place in public. This seems inconsistent with what he
says elsewhere in the book, since he argues there that only if an action
causes harm is there any justification for intervention. And in the
example mentioned the only possible harm that can occur would be
that members of the public find it offensive. Furthermore, it is not
clear, even with physical harms, what threshold of harm needs to be
reached before intervention becomes justified.

In Mill’s defence, his On Liberty was not intended as the last word
on the subject.

Private immorality harms society
One alleged justification for state intervention to prevent some
activities which are carried out in private and harm no one or else
only consenting adult participants is that a society only exists in virtue
of a common underlying set of moral principles. If these principles
are undermined, whether in public or private, then the society’s
continued existence may be threatened. So intervention may be
necessary, for the preservation of society, which is the basis of the
possibility of individual happiness.

The assumption that this last sort of criticism is based on is
controversial. There is a great deal of evidence that societies can
tolerate moral diversity without disintegrating.

Not utilitarian
Mill is explicit about the theoretical justification of the doctrines
of On Liberty: utilitarianism provides the ultimate justification for
the Harm Principle. However, a number of critics have pointed out
that, at times, Mill seems to be arguing for freedom as something
having intrinsic value whether or not it contributes to overall
happiness. Intrinsic value is usually contrasted with instrumental
value. Intrinsic value is the value that something has in itself;
instrumental value is the value that it has because it can be used to
get something else (money, for example, has instrumental value
because its value to us lies in its use rather than in the coins or notes
themselves). A utilitarian believes that the only thing that has intrinsic
value is human happiness: everything else which is of value is of
instrumental value in bringing about human happiness. So, we would
expect a utilitarian to say that the only value in freedom is that it is
conducive to happiness. But such a view does not obviously lead
to Mill’s conclusion that we should always preserve individual free-
dom except in cases where harm to others is likely. Indeed, a strict
utilitarian might claim that, for example, regarding freedom of speech,
in certain specific cases there might be good grounds for silencing
some true views because happiness would thereby be increased. If I
have reliable information that the whole of humanity will be destroyed
by a comet which will collide with our planet in the next few weeks,
you might have good utilitarian grounds for suppressing my freedom
of speech. If it were generally known that our species was about to
be wiped out it is fairly obvious that the overall level of human
unhappiness would increase significantly as compared with a situation
of ignorant bliss.

Mill suggests that freedom of speech is always for the best
except in the situation where there is a serious risk of direct harm as
a result. It is not obvious that utilitarianism provides a theoretical
justification for such a strong position. This sort of objection doesn’t
necessarily undermine Mill’s conclusions, but just points to the
fact that he has not provided a convincing utilitarian justification
for them.

Over-optimistic
Many of Mill’s views about freedom and its consequences are
optimistic, some, perhaps, over-optimistic. For example, he assumes
that adults are generally in the best position to know what is likely
to promote their own happiness. But is this obviously so? Many of
us are experts at self-deception and easily seduced into short-term
gratification at the expense of the chance of long-term happiness. We
tell ourselves stories about what will make our lives go well which,
on sober reflection, often turn out to be convenient fictions. If this
is so, it’s possible that someone else, who is not so involved in the
matter, might be better suited to assessing how I should live. But, of
course, any benefits which might ensue from letting other people
choose how I live will have to be offset against the accompanying
loss of my own self-direction.

Another area in which Mill is perhaps over-optimistic is that of
freedom of speech. He assumes that in the collision between truth
and error, truth will triumph. But this may not be the case. He
underestimates the power of irrationality in human life. Many of us
are strongly motivated to believe things which aren’t true. Allowing
false views to circulate freely may actually allow them to take root
amongst the gullible in a way that they would not have done had
they been silenced. Also, changes in technology have resulted in a
much wider dissemination of views. There is no evidence whatsoever
that amongst the diverse and widely disseminated views there has
been a strong tendency for truth to triumph over error. In the
circumstances, some people might think that there are good grounds
for censorship. However, any would-be censor will have to face up
to Mill’s point that if you suppress someone else’s opinion this
involves an assumption that you are infallible and that the beneficial
effects of silencing the view outweigh the detrimental ones.

Positive freedom
A further criticism of Mill’s account of freedom is that, by
concentrating on freedom from interference and by making the case
for tolerance, he missed a more important sense of the term ‘freedom’.
Mill provided an account of what is usually known as negative
freedom, or freedom from; what is needed, some of his critics believe,
is an account of positive freedom or freedom to. Those who defend
positive freedom argue that since society is imperfect, simply allowing
people space to get on with their lives isn’t sufficient to guarantee
them freedom. There are numerous obstacles to achieving freedom,
ranging from lack of material and educational resources to
psychological obstacles to success. Those who argue for the positive
sense of freedom believe that in order to fulfil your potential as a
human being and thereby be genuinely free, all kinds of state
intervention may be necessary, and at times this may result in
individuals having their range of activity curtailed, even though it
does not directly harm anyone else. Some of the more extreme
defenders of positive freedom even believe that it is acceptable to force
people to be free, and that there is no contradiction involved in this
notion. In contrast, in Mill’s terminology, if you are forced to do
something then you cannot, by definition, have done it freely.

  tions is that they are otherwise likely to harm someone else.
  Sometimes known as the Liberty Principle.
negative freedom: freedom from constraints. The principal kind of
  freedom advocated by Mill.
paternalism: forcing someone to do or refrain from something for
  their own good.
positive freedom: freedom actually to do what you really want
  to do. Obstacles to positive freedom can be internal as well as
external: for instance, weakness of will can prevent you from being
  free in this sense.
toleration: allowing people to conduct their lives as they wish, even
  though you disapprove of the choices they have made for
  themselves.
utilitarianism: the moral theory which declares that the morally right
  action in any circumstances is the one which is most likely to

utility: for Mill ‘utility’ is a technical term meaning happiness rather
  than usefulness. If an action increases utility, this simply means
