JOHN STUART MILL
UTILITARIANISM

Maximise happiness. That is a caricature of utilitarianism, but it does
capture something true and central to the theory. John Stuart Mill
is the most famous utilitarian philosopher; in his book Utilitarianism
he develops and refines the cruder version of the theory which had
been put forward by his mentor Jeremy Bentham. In order to
understand Mill’s approach it is important to see how it differs from
Bentham’s.

BENTHAM’S UTILITARIANISM
For Bentham, the morally right action in any circumstances is the
one that will tend to maximise total happiness. He conceives of happi-
ness as a blissful mental state: pleasure and the absence of pain. The
more of this that occurs in the world, the better. It doesn’t matter
how the pleasure is produced: Bentham famously declared that
pushpin (a pub game) was as worthwhile as poetry provided that they
produced equal amounts of pleasure. Each individual counts equally
in the calculation of how much pleasure is produced by an action,
and the total of pleasurable states is summed to determine how we
should act. This is utilitarian ism in its most straightforward form.

So, for instance, if a utilitarian wanted to decide whether to
leave her money to one poor relative or divide it between twenty
reasonably well-off friends, she would calculate how much total
pleasure would be produced by each. Although the inheritance might
make the poor relative very happy, the total amount of happi-
ness may still be less than making twenty reasonably well-off friends
moderately happy. If this were true, the woman should leave the
money to the friends rather than the relative.

Mill shared many of Bentham’s beliefs. Mill’s Greatest Happiness
Principle, for example, is simply ‘actions are right in proportion as
they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the
reverse of happiness’. Both Bentham and Mill were hedonists in
the sense that their approach to ethics was founded upon the pursuit
of pleasure (not, however, merely the pursuit of individuals’ own
pleasure, but rather the pursuit of the greatest overall pleasure).
Actions for both philosophers were to be judged according to their
probable consequences, not according to any religious code or set of
binding principles to be followed whatever consequences ensued.

The phrase ‘the greatest happiness of the greatest number’ is
sometimes used to describe the utilitarian approach to ethics, but
this can be misleading. What both Bentham and Mill were interested
in was achieving the greatest aggregate happiness (that is, the largest
total sum of happiness) irrespective of how that happiness was
distributed. It would be consistent with this approach to think that it
would be better to make a few people extremely happy than to make
a much larger number slightly happier, provided that the sum of
happiness in the first case was larger than the sum in the second.

Mill’s utilitarianism differs from Bentham’s in that he gives a more
sophisticated account of happiness. For Mill, there are qualita-
tively different sorts of pleasure: higher and lower pleasures. Higher
pleasures are to be preferred to lower ones. Bentham, in contrast,
treats all pleasures as on a par.

MILL ON HIGHER AND LOWER PLEASURES
One common criticism of simple versions of utilitarianism, such as
Bentham’s, is that they reduce the subtleties of human life to a stark
calculation of animal-like pleasures, with no concern for how these
pleasures are produced. Utilitarianism of this kind was ridiculed as a
doctrine only worthy of swine.

Mill meets such criticisms with his distinction between higher and
lower pleasures. As he puts it, it is better to be a dissatisfied human
being than a satisfied pig; and better to be a dissatisfied Socrates
than a satisfied fool. Human beings are capable of intellectual pleasures
as well as the brute physical ones; pigs cannot have intellectual
pleasures. Mill argues that the intellectual pleasures, those he calls
higher pleasures, are intrinsically more valuable than the physical
lower ones. His argument in support of this is that those who have
felt both kinds of pleasure will certainly prefer the intellectual kind.
This leaves him with the awkward fact that some people who are
capable of experiencing sublime intellectual pleasures nevertheless
throw themselves into lives of debauchery and sensual gratification.
His response to this sort of case is that they are led astray by the
temptation of immediate sensual gratification; they know full well
that the higher pleasures are more worthwhile.

THE ‘PROOF’ OF UTILITARIANISM
The obvious question to ask is ‘Why maximise happiness?’ Mill’s
answer is controversial, though it is important to realise that he never
claims that it provides a conclusive justification for his theory: he
does not believe that a theory such as utilitarianism can be proved to
be true.

Happiness, he says, is pursued as an end in itself. The ultimate
end of all human activity is happiness and the avoidance of pain.
Everything else which is desirable is desirable because it contributes
to such a life. If you spend your life collecting beautiful works of art,
this activity is a way of getting pleasure. If someone, for example,
argues against Mill by claiming that they pursue virtue as an end in
itself independently of any happiness that might arise from it, Mill
answers that virtue is then an ingredient in their happy life; it becomes
part of that person’s happiness.

The Greatest Happiness Principle claims that the end or purpose
of all human life is happiness and the avoidance of pain. These are
the only things that are desirable as ends; everything else desirable
is desirable as a means to these ends. So the question ‘Why maximise
happiness?’ is really just a question about what makes happiness
desirable. Mill suggests an analogy to answer this question. The only
way that we can prove that an object is visible is by demonstrating
that people actually can see it. Analogously, he claims, the only evi-
dence we can give that happiness is desirable is that people actually
do desire it. Each person finds his or her own happiness desirable, so
general happiness is the sum of the individual happiness, and itself
desirable.

CRITICISMS OF UTILITARIANISM

‘Proof’ is based on bad arguments
Mill’s attempt to justify the belief that we ought to maximise
happiness contains some allegedly bad arguments. Most of these were
pointed out by Henry Sidgwick. First, the move from what is visible
to what is desirable is misleading. Mill suggests that because we can
tell what is visible by identifying what is seen, it follows that we
can tell what is desirable by identifying what people actually do
desire. But on closer inspection the analogy between ‘visible’ and
‘desirable’ does not hold. ‘Visible’ means ‘can be seen’, but ‘desirable’
doesn’t usually mean ‘can be desired’; what it usually means is ‘should
be desired’ or ‘is worthy of being desired’, and that is certainly the
sense in which Mill employs it in his argument. Once the weakness
of the analogy between the two words has been pointed out, it is
difficult to see how describing what people actually do desire is likely
to reveal anything about what people should desire.

But even if Mill had established that happiness is desirable in
the appropriate sense, this would lead logically to a form of egoism,
each person pursuing his or her own happiness, rather than the more
benevolent approach of utilitarianism which makes the greatest
happiness possible its aim. Mill thinks that because each individual
wants his or her own happiness, the total of all the individual happi-
nesses can simply be added up to give an aggregate which would then
itself be desirable. But this does not follow at all. He needs a far stronger
argument to prove that the general happiness, rather than just our
own individual happiness, is something that we all ought to pursue.

Difficulties of calculation
Even if Mill had established that there were good grounds for adopting
a utilitarian approach to ethics, there are still some objections to the
theory and its application which he would need to meet. One practical
difficulty is that of calculating which of the many possible actions is
most likely to produce the most happiness overall. This might be a
particularly vexing issue when you had to make a moral decision
quickly – for instance, if you were faced with a dilemma about whom
to save from a burning building, given that you could only save one
person and there were three people trapped inside. In such a situation
you just would not have time to sit down and calculate probable
consequences.

Mill’s response to this sort of objection was that throughout
human history people have been learning from their experience
about the probable courses of different sorts of action. The solution
is to come up with some general principles about which sorts of actions
tend to maximise happiness, rather than to go back to the Greatest
Happiness Principle whenever you are faced with a moral decision.
Mill, then, suggests that the rational approach to life involves
adopting such general principles rather than forever calculating
possible consequences. Thus his utilitarianism has two stages: the
derivation of general principles on utilitarian grounds, and then the
application of those principles to particular cases.

Higher/lower pleasures
Mill’s division of pleasures into two categories creates problems
of several sorts. Because these pleasures are different in kind rather
than just degree it makes the calculation and comparison of conse-
quences of actions far more complex. Higher and lower pleasures
are incommensurable: that is, there is no common currency in which
both can be measured and compared. So it is not at all clear how we
are to apply Mill’s version of utilitarianism in circumstances where
both higher and lower pleasures enter into the calculation.

Furthermore, the higher/lower pleasure distinction looks like
a self-serving one. It is no surprise to find an intellectual defending
the idea that intellectual activity produces pleasures of a more
satisfying kind than merely physical ones. This in itself doesn’t prove
the theory is false; it just reveals the fact that Mill might have had
a vested interest in the intellectual pleasures being intrinsically more
valuable than others.

Unpalatable consequences
The strict application of utilitarian principles in some cases has
consequences which many people would find unacceptable. For
example, if there had been a gruesome murder, and the police had
found a suspect who they knew hadn’t committed the murder, there
might be utilitarian grounds for framing him and punishing him
accordingly. Presumably most members of the public would be very
happy that the culprit had been caught and punished; they would
remain happy just as long as no one found out that he was in fact
innocent. The innocent man’s suffering would be great for him,
but in the calculation of consequences would be far outweighed
by the sum of pleasure that many millions of people would feel at
seeing what they believe to be justice to have been done. Yet, this
consequence of utilitarian morality would be unpalatable for most of
us: our intuitions are that punishing the innocent is unjust and should
not be permitted whatever the beneficial consequences of this practice.

One response to this sort of criticism is to modify utilitarianism
into what is known as rule utilitarianism. Here general principles
of conduct are worked out on utilitarian grounds, such as that in
general punishing innocent people produces more unhappiness than
happiness. These general principles are then adhered to even in the
few particular cases in which, for example, punishing an innocent
person would in fact produce the greatest sum of happiness possible
from available options. Some have claimed that Mill is himself a rule
utilitarian. However, it is more plausible that what Mill says about
working out general guidelines of behaviour before you are faced with
a situation in which you must act quickly (rather than having to do
a calculation on the spot) is only intended to produce rules of thumb,
generalisations which can be broken in particular cases and are not
binding principles of conduct.

  more selfish motivation.
egoism: acting solely from one’s own interests.
Greatest Happiness Principle: the basic tenet of utilitarianism, namely
  that the morally right action in any circumstances is the one which
  is most likely to maximise happiness.
hedonism: pursuit of pleasure.
higher pleasures: the more intellectual pleasures of thought and
  artistic appreciation. Mill assigns these much higher value than
  the lower physical pleasures.
lower pleasures: the physical pleasures which animals as well as
  humans can experience, such as those which come from eating,
  or from sex.
rule utilitarianism: a variety of utilitarianism which, instead of focus -
  ing on particular actions, looks at the kinds of action which tend
  to maximise happiness.
utilitarianism: the moral theory which declares that the morally right
  action in any circumstances is the one which is most likely to
  maximise happiness.
utility: for Mill ‘utility’ is a technical term meaning happiness rather
  than usefulness. If an action increases utility, this simply means
  that it increases happiness.
