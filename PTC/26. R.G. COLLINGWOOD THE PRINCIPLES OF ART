R.G. COLLINGWOOD
THE PRINCIPLES
OF ART

What is art? That’s not an easy question to answer. There are so
many different things that we call art, but some of them probably
don’t merit the name. Most people would acknowledge that a
Rembrandt self-portrait and a fugue by J.S. Bach are art, but there
are many cases that are likely to be contentious. There isn’t even
agreement about Marcel Duchamp’s famous ‘Fountain’, a porcelain
urinal that he signed ‘R. Mutt’ and displayed in an open art exhibition
in New York in 1917: to some this is a central example of twentieth-
century art, whereas to others it is just a sensationalist gesture that
was more like a critical comment about art exhibitions, or even a joke,
than a work of art itself.

When people ask the question ‘What is art?’ they are rarely just
asking about how a word is used. That’s why a dictionary definition
won’t resolve the issue. When they ask this question they are more
often seeking enlightenment on questions about what makes
something worthy of being called art, and believe that to call
something a work of art implies that it has a certain value, or at least
potential value, to us. R.G. Collingwood, an Oxford philosopher most
active in the interwar years, in his book The Principles of Art (1938)
drew a distinction between the things that we happen to call art and
the things that deserve to be called art. Many of the things we call
art don’t deserve the term: they are not ‘art proper’, they are only
‘art so-called.’ Art proper involves a particular kind of expression of
emotion that in the process of expression clarifies the precise nature
of the emotion being expressed. Although Plato, Aristotle, Augustine,
Hegel, Hume, Nietzsche and many other great philosophers had
written about the arts, when Collingwood was writing his book in
the 1930s this was an unusual topic for a British philosopher to
address – he drew some of his inspiration from an Italian philosopher
Benedetto Croce.

WHO WAS R.G. COLLINGWOOD?
R.G. Collingwood was an unusual philosopher with very wide
interests. As well as writing The Principles of Art, he wrote an
influential book about the philosophy of history and spent much of
his time working on Roman archaeology in Britain. His father had
been a successful watercolour painter, and Collingwood himself drew
and painted and knew about the practicalities of making art as well
as the theory. His understanding of how visual artists work informs
his approach in The Principles of Art: much of the book focuses on
the artist’s creative processes, rather than, for example, the experience
of a viewer, although that is discussed. Collingwood is also unusual
in that he believed that some sorts of so-called art can be morally
corrupting, and that ‘moral salvation’ can be achieved through art
proper.

THE TECHNICAL THEORY OF ART
Collingwood attacked what he labelled the Technical Theory of Art.
This is his name for the idea that art is simply a series of techniques
for transforming raw materials in particular ways to elicit certain sorts
of response. The Technical Theory treats art as a kind of craft: in this
view the artist transforms its ingredients into something which
matches a pre-conceived blueprint. A carpenter makes a table by
designing it, then converting materials such as wood, nails, varnish
and glue into a table that matches his or her design. Similarly, some
people think of an artist as a person who shapes raw materials – which
might include canvas and paint, words, or sounds – into works of art
by means of artistic technique.

BUT DOESN’T ART INVOLVE CRAFT?
Collingwood is often saddled with a view that he didn’t actually hold,
namely that art proper never involves craft or planning. That would
obviously be an absurd position open to numerous counterexamples.
Michaelangelo, for example, when painting the ceiling of the Sistine
Chapel, certainly planned the execution before he climbed his
scaffolding, and used techniques to manipulate his raw materials
of paint and plaster into a pre-conceived configuration. If he hadn’t
done that the result would probably have been a mess rather than a
great work of art. Collingwood’s point, however, is that craft of this
sort cannot be the essence of art, since much art doesn’t involve
it. In principle many works of art can be composed entirely in the
mind. So craft can’t be at the heart of what makes an object or other
creation a work of art. More typical of an artist, though, in his view,
was the sculptor who plays with a piece of clay between his fingers,
gradually turning it into a figure of a dancing man, but doing this
by designing while making rather than following any pre-conceived
plan to turn the raw material into a specific figure with specific
characteristics.

Although artists sometimes do know precisely what they are going
to make before they make it, that isn’t relevant to their work as artists,
whereas it is essential to the work of a craftsperson that he or she
knows what the finished item will be before constructing it. A
carpenter knows when a table is finished; an artist will usually feel
that still more work could be done. Someone setting out to make a
table will know its precise dimensions, the materials needed to put it
together and how the various parts will be joined. According to the
Technical Theory of Art artists do the same sort of thing as
craftspeople. Collingwood rejects that theory, maintaining that artists
are born not made, and that art is not simply a matter of technique,
despite the fact that many, perhaps even all, great artists had very
refined techniques in their chosen field. His point is that it wasn’t
their technique that made them artists, and it wasn’t the process of
turning raw material into pre-conceived objects that made their
creations art.

ART SO-CALLED

Magic Art
Collingwood is keen to distinguish so-called art from art proper. Two
categories of art so-called are ‘Magic Art’ and ‘Entertainment Art’.
Magic Art is the kind of art produced to be used in rituals that involve
the arousal of emotion that is to be channelled into practical or
religious effect. This category includes not just the ritually significant
art of other cultures, but also of our own: patriotic music, such as
‘Rule Britannia’ or ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’ would be considered
magic art in his terms. But magic art isn’t art proper since it is
principally a means to an end, a way of discharging emotions in a
socially appropriate way with a view to motivating action, and has
been constructed with this end in mind. Its worth lies largely in its
instrumental value. This is very different from art proper.

Entertainment Art
Again, the category of Entertainment Art may to many people seem
like a form of art proper, but Collingwood rejects this view.
Entertainment art, art that has been created simply to entertain us,
is not art proper. Collingwood warned of its corrupting effects: such
art stimulates specific sorts of emotional responses, laughter, pleasure
or amusement. But it does this by triggering a response. In contrast,
art proper requires, as we will see, that the audience goes through
much the same process as the artist has gone through in creating the
work of art. Such art, Collingwood believes, can be corrupting. It is
morally corrupting because it draws people away from life, and makes
them believe that their own amusement is the chief good in the world,
whereas art proper requires a kind of engagement from its audience
that raises their levels of self-knowledge and awareness.

Both Magic Art and Entertainment Art are forms of craft in
Collingwood’s view: neither is a form of art, despite their superficial
resemblances to art.

ART PROPER

Clarifying emotions by expressing them
Collingwood’s aims aren’t just destructive: he gives a positive account
of what art proper is – art that deserves to be called art – as well as
pointing out the types of so-called art that aren’t worthy of the name.
Rather than beginning with a pre-conceived aim or blueprint, the artist
typically starts with what Collingwood describes as an ‘inchoate’
emotion that he or she wants to get clear. ‘Inchoate’ simply means
‘not fully formed’. The process of creating an artwork is, for
Collingwood, principally one of grappling with a barely understood
feeling or emotion and through a process which may involve
manipulation of a medium such as paint or clay, gradually getting
clearer about that precise emotion. This is the process known as
expressing an emotion. Expressing an emotion is different from
betraying an emotion. If I’m angry, my red face and loud voice may
reveal to others that I am angry, perhaps even before I’m aware of
this myself. These are symptoms of my anger. But that is not what
Collingwood means by the expression of an emotion. In other words,
artistic creation is a kind of self-understanding: the process of
‘designing while making’ that is characteristic of artistic work is one
of refining our understanding of the emotion that is being expressed,
a way of learning in a more precise way what that emotion is. Until
the emotion is expressed artistically, the artist won’t really know it:
the emotion will be vague and imprecise. Artistic creation is, then, a
process of the bringing to consciousness of something of which the
artist is, until the work has been made, only pre-consciously aware.

Experiencing art
When a viewer looks at a painting he or she undergoes something
like the experience of the artist creating the work. The viewer’s
experience of the work of art is itself emotional expression, a kind of
receptivity to the very emotion that the artist expressed in the work.

CRITICISMS OF COLLINGWOOD’S THEORY
OF ART

Narrow essentialism
One criticism of Collingwood’s approach to the definition of art
is that it is essentialist. He assumes that all art has an essence, a
shared common feature which he identifies as a particular kind of
expression of emotion. Some subsequent philosophers of art have
argued that art is best understood as what Ludwig Wittgenstein called
a family resemblance term: that is, there is a pattern of overlapping
resemblances between those things that we recognise as art, but no
single essential defining feature, no quality that makes them all
worthy of being called art. On this view Collingwood’s mistake was
to focus so much on the expression of emotion. This led him to exclude
many things which should be recognised as art from his category of
art proper. Art need not always be expression, even if it often is.
Collingwood’s mistake was to assume that all art has features in
common.

Over-optimistic moralising
For Collingwood art is not a trivial matter: art is part of what allows
a culture to make progress by revealing to audiences the secrets of
their own hearts, and allowing them to recapitulate the process
of expression through their engagement with the work of art. At
various points in The Principles of Art Collingwood adopts a scathing
tone towards, for example, the distracting and in his view morally
corrupting effects of art so-called. Cinema and radio come in for attack
from him: this aspect of the book now seems remarkably dated and,
indeed, it would be extremely controversial to claim today that there
is no such thing as cinematic art. In the final line of the book
Collingwood declares that art is the medicine for ‘the worst disease
of the mind’: the corruption of consciousness. Art is not just a valuable
aspect of life, but in his view a kind of panacea. Many readers will
find aspects of his account of the nature of art plausible but will be
alienated by this tendency to make art a kind of transformative moral
therapy for its audiences, a therapy that is capable of rescuing a culture
from moral and psychological disaster. Collingwood was writing in
the 1930s before the atrocities of the Holocaust. Some of these
atrocities were committed by Nazis who were sophisticated readers
of Goethe who regularly attended classical concerts by Mozart and
Beethoven. The idea that art acts as a moral safeguard is hard to
maintain in the light of this fact.

GLOSSARY
art so-called: Collingwood’s term for those things which may be
  called art yet which do not merit the name.
art proper: the term Collingwood uses to distinguish art from art so-
  called.
betraying an emotion: showing an emotion through, for example,
  action or tone of voice. This is very different from expressing an
  emotion, which involves a more sophisticated kind of dawning self-
  consciousness in Collingwood’s view.
craft: a process of turning raw materials into a finished pre-conceived
  object through following some kind of blueprint or plan. Such craft
  usually requires skills which can be taught and improved.
expression: the process of clarifying an inchoate emotion.
inchoate emotion: an emotion that has yet to be made precise through
  expression. Collingwood believed that artists typically begin with
  an inchoate emotion that they clarify and make precise through
  engagement with a medium that allows them to express that
  emotion and thereby facilitate the process of the audience
  expressing that same emotion.
Technical Theory of Art: the theory that equates art with craft.
