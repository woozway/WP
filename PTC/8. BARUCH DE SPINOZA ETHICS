BARUCH DE SPINOZA
ETHICS

Baruch de Spinoza’s Ethics is a strange book. It bristles with all
the jargon of Euclidian geometry: definitions, axioms, numbered
propositions, corollaries and scholia. Yet, if you get beyond this
intimidating technical apparatus, you will find a fascinating and, in
places, profound attempt to understand our place in the universe.

The full title of the book is Ethics Demon strated in a Geometrical
Manner. Why, you might ask, would anyone attempt to write a
philosophical treatise in the form of a geometry textbook? One answer
is that Spinoza was impressed by the way in which Euclid deduced
his conclusions logically from the various explicit assumptions that
he made. The conclusions followed inexorably from the premises and
were derived with transparency and elegance. Spinoza’s conclusions
spell out what the true implications of various definitions are. If you
accept his premises, then you must accept his conclusions, provided
that his reasoning is good.

Despite the jargon of geometry with which this book is liberally
sprinkled, Spinoza’s arguments never quite achieve the purity of
those found in geometrical treatises. Within the pages of this dif-
ficult book, however, are philosophical and psychological insights of
great power.

Spinoza is usually described as a rationalist. He believed that
knowledge about our place in the universe could be achieved by the
power of reason alone. In this his emphasis was very different from
empiricists who believed that the basic source of knowledge is
experience and observation. Spinoza believed not only that reason
could discover the nature of the universe, but also that this was
because the universe was arranged in a rational order. The structure
of the universe is no accident; it is necessarily as it is. Sense experience,
which is imperfect, could never give us an adequate understanding
of the universe. This is not to say that Spinoza denigrated scientific
research: he earned his living as a lens-grinder, work which depended
on the science of optics. The lenses he made would have been used
in microscopes and telescopes, instruments used to increase scientific
knowledge.

THE TITLE
It is accurate, as we have seen, to describe this book as ‘Demonstrated
in a Geometrical Manner’. However, not all of the contents of
the book discuss what we would now think of as ethics. Much of the
first part of the book is about substance and God, which turn out to
be the same thing. We would now classify this discussion as
metaphysics. Spinoza’s theme is the universe and our place in it –
the nature of reality. For him metaphysics and ethics were not
separable. The nature of reality determines how we ought to live.

GOD AND PANTHEISM
In the early sections of Ethics Spinoza sets out to prove from his
definition of substance that there can only be one substance (a pos -
ition known as monism) and that this substance is God. The
consequence of this is that everything that exists is somehow in God.
God didn’t create nature, He is nature. Spinoza writes of ‘God or
Nature’, apparently equating the two. Thought and extension (the
occupying of physical space) are simply two of God’s infinite
attributes, the two attributes that we have access to. Spinoza’s
argument for this position is complex. His conclusion that everything
is somehow in God is often taken to be a species of pantheism. More
subtle interpreters stress that Spinoza is only saying that all God’s
attributes are expressed in the world, not that God is nothing more
than the world. So if Spinoza is a pantheist, his is not the crude
pantheism which declares that the world simply is identical with God.

Whatever the correct interpretation of Spinoza’s theological
position, it is evident that it was very far from Christian and Jewish
orthodoxy about the nature of God. Of Portuguese descent, Spinoza
was born in Amsterdam in 1632 and raised as a Jew. He was
excommunicated in 1656 because he had abandoned orthodox Jewish
beliefs. It is easy to see why he could only have his Ethics published
posthumously and why some of his contemporaries were convinced
that he had ceased to believe in God at all.

MIND AND BODY
Spinoza had an interesting solution to the mind/body problem, the
problem of explaining the relationship between the mental and
the physical aspects of our existence. He knew his contemporary
Descartes’ work well and even published a book about his philosophy.
Much of Spinoza’s philosophy specifically opposes Descartes’ views.
Unlike Descartes, who argued that mind and body were entirely
distinct, Spinoza maintained that the mental and the physical were
inseparable aspects of the same thing. The mind is the same thing as
the body. We can conceive this thing as either physical or mental.
Mind is not itself a substance but rather a mode of substance. Mind
and body do not interact in the way that Descartes described: they
are just two aspects of the same thing. A consequence of this view,
that Spinoza accepts, is that all physical things can have mental
aspects.

FREEDOM AND HUMAN BONDAGE
The idea of freedom lies at the heart of Spinoza’s moral teaching. Yet
he denies that we can ever be free from chains of cause and effect.
All our actions, and everything that happens in the universe, are
determined by prior causes. You picked up this book and are reading
it, but on Spinoza’s account your decision was determined by prior
decisions, physical events and so on. Your decision did not arise
spontaneously from nowhere, even if it felt that way. Only God can
be truly free in the sense that God’s actions do not have prior causes.

So in the sense of being outside of the chain of cause and effect,
there is no hope of human freedom. Yet Spinoza does argue that we
can save ourselves from enslavement to the passions. This will make
us free in the only sense in which we can be free, which is acting
from internal rather than external causes. Moral action is acting for
oneself rather than being in the grip of passions. The passions are
forces which push us one way or another leaving us as helpless
victims. When we can liberate ourselves from the passivity of being
the vehicles of such passions and come to understand our actions we
become free.

Human bondage is the condition of those who are ignorant of the
causes of their actions. People in this condition are moved by external
causes alone: they are incapable of acting freely in the sense just
described. They are like stones pushed around by forces they don’t
comprehend. It is only by forming an adequate idea of the causes of
our behaviour that we can escape this bondage, and make the causes
of our action internal rather than external. Once we recognise the
causes of an emotion it ceases to hold us in its grip as a passion. The
Ethics is designed in part to teach the reader to attain this kind of
agency, to become more fully human.

In this respect, then, Spinoza’s thought recommends a kind of
psychotherapy. To achieve freedom from the passions we must
understand the true causes of our actions. Yet this doesn’t mean that
free decisions cease to have causes. When understanding is achieved
these causes are internalised. They are transformed by being
understood. But the actions they give rise to remain determined. So
Spinoza sees human free will in this particular sense as compatible
with our actions being causally determined.

LOVE OF GOD
In the later sections of the Ethics Spinoza presents an almost myst-
ical picture of the wise way to live. We should strive to make
sense of ourselves and our place in the universe. That is the path to
wisdom. It is also the path to joy as the mind becomes more active
and attains a higher degree of perfection. Although Spinoza makes
the intel lectual love of God a central aspect of his philosophy, this
is not the love of any personal God concerned with our well-being.
Indeed, Spinoza’s philosophy has no room for the God described in
traditional Chris tianity and Judaism: Spinoza’s God is as impersonal
as the geometrical arguments he uses to deduce God’s existence and
scope.

CRITICISMS OF ETHICS

No need for God
Once Spinoza had dispensed with the idea of a personal God and had,
as far as he was concerned, proved that the natural world somehow
expressed God’s attributes, he could have taken a further step and
embraced an atheistic philosophy. The God he describes is so different
from the God of orthodox Christianity and Judaism, that it scarcely
merits the name ‘God’ at all. Indeed, some of Spinoza’s contemporaries
believed that his philosophy was tantamount to atheism. Yet he was
convinced that he had proved God’s existence, and that the good life
was a life expressing love of God.

Denies genuine freedom
The picture of the human condition that Spinoza paints in the Ethics
leaves no room for the spontaneity of uncaused choice that some
philosophers, such as Jean-Paul Sartre, see as the essence of free will.
The best that we can achieve is that our actions be brought about by
internal rather than external causes according to Spinoza. And yet
the bleaker account of human freedom that Spinoza provides is
persuasive, and may be more accurate. Perhaps it is just wishful
thinking to believe that we can make uncaused choices about what
we think and do. Spinoza saw himself as exposing the delusion of
free will.

Over-optimistic about reason
Spinoza, like many philosophers before and since, saw the human
capacity for reason as the path to wisdom and happiness. The
intellectual contemplation of God was for him the highest form of
happiness possible and brought its own rewards. This sounds like the
convenient conclusion of an intellectual who happened to find solace
in his own thought. Perhaps he was over-optimistic about reason and
its capacity to bring us happiness. And yet he is surely right that by
coming to understand some of the causes of our states of mind we
can gain greater control over our lives.

GLOSSARY
monism: the view that there is only one type of substance in the
  world.
pantheism: the view that God is everything. It is debatable whether
  or not Spinoza really was a pantheist.
rationalism: the belief that knowledge can be acquired through the
  power of reasoning. This contrasts with the empiricists’ view that
  knowledge comes from observation.
