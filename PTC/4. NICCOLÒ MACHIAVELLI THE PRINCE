NICCOLÒ MACHIAVELLI
THE PRINCE

Most readers of The Prince expect it to be a self-help manual for the
ruthless. But the book is far subtler than that. Although Niccolò
Machiavelli does advocate dissimulation and cruelty at times, he
reserves his praise for those who know how and when to use force
and guile. He explains how a strong and effective ruler can best serve
the interests of the state. His advice is not meant for just anyone: it
is advice for princes – rulers whose actions determine the fate of their
subjects. Such people, he suggests should not be squeamish. They
need to act swiftly and effectively to do what is best. And what is
best for the state may be to ignore conventional morality.

Machiavelli had a successful career as a statesman in his native
Florence. In 1513, however, he was accused of plotting against the
powerful Medici family. He was imprisoned, tortured, and then sent
into exile just outside the city. It seems that he wrote The Prince in
order to demonstrate his suitability as an adviser to new princes. It
was a kind of calling card intended to help him re-enter the fray of
political life. In this respect it failed. He did not get the position
he hoped for. First published in 1532, shortly after Machiavelli’s death,
The Prince has always been a controversial book. Today it is frequently
cited in discussions of the alleged inevitability of ‘dirty hands’ in
politics and the adjective ‘machiavellian’ is used, misleadingly, to
describe cunning pursuit of self-interest.

The Prince is written in the genre of ‘mirrors for princes’ – short
tracts advising and inspiring rulers. These were popular in the
Renaissance. Typically they would counsel such virtues as courage
and compassion. In complete contrast, Machiavelli’s advice was that
a successful prince needs to learn how not to be good, to take swift
and sometimes cruel action when this is necessary. A successful prince
will only honour his word when it suits him to do so, though it usually
pays him to appear honest. He needs to act like a fox in order to
recognise and avoid the traps others set for him, but also, sometimes
as a lion to frighten off the wolves that surround him. The message
is that a prince needs to know how to act like a beast: a challenge to
the humanistic tradition in which princes were expected to act as moral
exemplars to their people.

HUMAN NATURE
Machiavelli has a low view of human nature. Based on his own
observation, and his knowledge of Florentine history and classical
texts, he declares that people behave in predictably bad ways. They
are fickle, they lie, they shun danger, and they are greedy. In these
circumstances, a prince needs to use fear to achieve effective rule:
being loved isn’t a reliable source of power, since people break bonds
of gratitude when it suits them to do so. If you have a choice it is
best to be both loved and feared; but if you have to choose one above
the other, choose to be feared.

Machiavelli is interested in how people actually behave rather than
in how they ought to behave. His point is that unless a prince
recognises how fickle human beings really are and always have
been, he is likely to come to grief. It is no use trusting people to keep
their promises if they are in fact likely to break them. And the prince
should not feel bound to keep his promises in such circumstances:
that would be foolhardy. Machiavelli argues that the successful
prince should follow a very different code from that advocated by
traditional morality, whether that comes from a classical or Christian
source.

Appearance is everything for a prince. People react to superficial
characteristics and rarely, if ever, perceive a prince as he really is.
Consequently a prince must manipulate the way he appears, even if,
behind the mask, he is something quite different.

VIRTÙ
The key concept in understanding The Prince is, in Italian, virtù,
usually translated as ‘prowess’. Although it comes from the Latin
word for virtue (virtus), it has, for Machiavelli, a very different
meaning. Throughout the book Machiavelli’s aim is to explain how
a prince can display this quality of virtù. Virtù is the ability to act
swiftly and effectively to do whatever will secure the safety and
continuing prosperity of the state. This may mean making false
promises, murdering those who threaten you, even, where necessary,
butchering your own supporters.

Virtù will increase his chances of success as a ruler, but even a
virtuoso ruler (one who displays virtù) won’t necessarily flourish.
Machiavelli believes that half of our lives are governed by chance
events over which we have no control: no matter how well-prepared
he may be, a prince’s projects can still be thwarted by misfortune.
Fortune is like a river which floods its banks: once it is in full flood,
there is nothing anyone can do to control it. But this doesn’t stop us
from taking action before the river floods, so that the damage caused
will be less severe. Chance events usually cause most damage where
no precautions have been taken. Machiavelli does, however, believe
that fortune favours the young and the bold. In a disturbing metaphor,
fortune is a woman who responds to the advances of an audacious
young man who beats and coerces her. Virtù is the manly quality he
uses to subdue her.

Machiavelli’s model of a prince who demonstrated virtù was Cesare
Borgia. His prowess involved tricking the Orsini into coming to
Sinigaglia where he had them murdered. However, the move of
Borgia’s which Machiavelli seems to appreciate most was taken against
one of his own employees. Once Borgia had taken control of Romagna
he placed a cruel henchman, Remirro de Orco, in charge, who quickly
pacified the region through violence. Borgia decided that such cruelties
could grow intolerable, and in order to expunge the hatred that was
beginning to be directed at him, Borgia had Remirro de Orco
murdered, and his body left hacked in two halves in a public piazza.
With this single brutal spectacle he kept the people of Romagna both
appeased and stupefied. Machiavelli applauds Borgia’s actions as skilful
uses of cruelty. He contrasts Borgia’s approach with that of the
ruthless tyrant Agathocles who was little more than a thug and whose
actions failed to display virtù.

CESARE BORGIA VERSUS AGATHOCLES
Agathocles became king of Syracuse by crime: he slaughtered the
senators and richest citizens of Syracuse and simply seized power.
He ruled and defended his country, but did so with cruelty and
inhumanity. In Machiavelli’s eyes his actions should not be confused
with virtù. What distinguished Borgia from Agathocles? Machiavelli
is not completely clear about what sets them apart; however, the most
plausible interpretation is this. They both used cruelty effectively and
economically. Borgia’s actions, however, had they achieved their
end, would have brought about a situation that was in the common
interest (despite being almost certainly inspired by a lust for power).
Agathocles, in contrast, was a brutal tyrant whose actions left Syracuse
in a worse situation than before: his actions were nothing more than
criminal. Hence Borgia demonstrated virtù; Agathocles did not.

The fact that Machiavelli condemns Agathocles’ actions should
silence those who claim that Machiavelli simply approves of immor-
ality. It is true that he approves of some actions which conventional
morality would label ‘immoral’, such as Borgia’s treatment of Remirro
de Orco; and it is certainly true that he had no respect whatsoever
for what we would now see as basic human rights. He even seems to
take delight in descriptions of bloodshed. However, there are actions,
such as those of Agathocles, of which he disapproves.

INTERPRETATIONS OF THE PRINCE

Satirical?
Some commentators have found Machiavelli’s approach to politics so
extreme that they have assumed he must be satirising tyrannical
princes. Surely, they argue, he can’t have seriously held up Cesare
Borgia as a model of a good prince. By ironically championing the
immoral actions of a ruthless prince, they claim, he was really criti-
cising rather than endorsing that approach to statecraft. This seems
to have been Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s view of The Prince.

There is very little evidence in support of such an interpret ation
apart from the fact that in his later book, Discourses on Livy,
Machiavelli reveals his republican sympathies: a fact which might
lend support to the view that he was fundamentally opposed to the
idea that Florence should be ruled by a prince. The consensus of critical
opinion, however, is that Machiavelli was writing in earnest in The
Prince, and this explains why the work is so challenging.

Amoral?
An alternative interpretation of The Prince is that Machiavelli
was giving instructions for those who wanted to retain power and
didn’t care in the slightest about morality. On this interpretation
Machiavelli is amoral, completely outside morality, and simply giving
guidance to those who are prepared to act like psychopaths. This
interpretation is implausible. As the comparison of Cesare Borgia and
Agathocles shows, Machiavelli does not approve of unlimited cruelty
exercised for purely selfish motives and without beneficial effect
for the state. Nor is the book an uncritical ‘how to’ manual. In
Machiavelli’s discussions cruelty always has a point, a moral point:
it is to prevent even more cruel actions being taken later on; it is for
the common good. The Prince, then, is far from an amoral book. It
may advocate policies which are immoral by conventional standards,
but these policies are themselves given moral and political justifi-
cations. It is, then, far more than a manual providing techniques by
which the unscrupulous can become powerful.

Machiavelli’s originality
The historian of ideas, Isaiah Berlin (1909–1997) gives a far more
subtle picture of Machiavelli’s contribution to political thought. On
his interpretation, Machiavelli’s great originality and appeal lies in
the fact that he recognised the shortcomings of classical and Christian
morality when applied to the situation of a prince. A prince who
displays the traditional virtues, such as honesty and compassion,
is likely to play into the hands of his enemies, who are unlikely
to be so scrupulous. Berlin’s point is that, far from being amoral,
Machiavelli, perhaps unwittingly, introduced the notion that there
could be more than one morality and that these moralities might not
be compatible with one another. It’s not that one morality is the true
one and all others false. Rather there are genuinely incompatible
moralities that are each consistent from within.

Berlin defends a position known as value pluralism, the idea that
there can be many incompatible moral systems and no principles for
deciding between the systems (though some systems can be
recognisably superior to others). He sees a precursor of his own views
in Machiavelli’s writings.

Dirty hands in politics
One way in which Machiavelli’s ideas still inform present-day debate
is in the area of ‘dirty hands’ in politics, the idea that some sorts of
apparently immoral behaviour are an inevitable consequence of the
role of being a political leader. Machiavelli’s account in The Prince
seems to imply that any effective ruler will, necessarily, have to learn
to be cruel, and, on occasion, to go directly against the dictates of
conventional morality. This is not to say that behaviour such as
telling lies or half-truths, breaking promises and so on, are for him
genuinely immoral when done by political leaders with the interests
of their people at heart. On Machiavelli’s account princes must follow
a different, and (for them) a more appropriate moral code from the
rest of humanity.

CRITICISMS OF THE PRINCE

Advocates immorality
Machiavelli shows no respect for what we would now call human
rights. For him, individuals can be sacrificed (literally if appropriate)
in the interests of the state. State torture and murder are sometimes
necessary; indeed he suggests that a ruler who is reluctant to use such
methods swiftly and effectively when the occasion arises is in some
sense a bad prince, since his squeamishness will very likely lead to
more extensive bloodshed later.

Recent history has shown the dangers of unleashing tyrants on
unsuspecting populations. The consequences of giving such tyrants
an apparent intellectual justification for their behaviour are likely to
include intense suffering for at least some of their subjects. Given
the human capacity for self-deception, it is easy to imagine such
leaders telling themselves that what they are doing is really neces-
sary if their country is to thrive. In fact this may be a self-serving
rationalisation of appalling violence and far too high a price to pay
for political stability. Machiavelli’s response to such a criticism would
be that the effectiveness of such violence is always to be judged by
its results: did the state become richer, more stable, more powerful,
or didn’t it? For him there are no other relevant considerations.

Too cynical
Machiavelli has a very low view of human motives. Perhaps he is
wrong about this. Many people are far more optimistic about the
potential of human beings to care about one another’s plight than he
is. If he is wrong about human fickleness, then rule by fear and
clinically effective cruelty may not be necessary. If he is right, how-
ever, political leaders who unswervingly display the conventional
virtues may be placing their people in jeopardy.
