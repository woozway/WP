MICHEL EYQUEM DE
MONTA IGNE ESSAYS

Michel Eyquem de Montaigne invented the essay. Or, rather, he
invented the ‘essai’ – the word in French means something a little
different from what it means in English. In French it suggests trying
something out, an attempt, a trial; whereas in English an ‘essay’, for
most students at least, is a piece of writing with a clearly stated
conclusion and arguments and evidence given in support of that
conclusion. Usually such essays are for assessment purposes, a test
of what you know and how well you can organise that material. For
Montaigne, in contrast, the essay was an experimental form, and
not necessarily conclusive. He wrote to explore ideas, combining
references to classical authors with descriptions of quirky aspects of
his day-to-day life. Unlike most student essay-writers he was happy
to reveal how little he knew, as well as to describe with disconcerting
honesty features of his life, including his sexual life, that few of his
day would openly share. 107 of these essays survive on topics as
diverse as death, skepticism and cannibalism. Some argue to a
conclusion, others meander and digress.

In contrast to the later philosopher Immanuel Kant, who in his
famous Critique of Pure Reason (see Chapter 14) arranged his ideas
in a highly systematic way, according to what he called his
‘architectonic’, Montaigne was open about the lack of plan, the
eccentricity of his book’s arrangement: such tidiness did not reflect
how life is lived, nor the style of Montaigne’s thought. If you want
to understand and celebrate the messiness of life, the accumulation
of details and apparently unconnected events, then Montaigne is
likely to appeal to you. Where Kant presents himself as one who
knows the answers and proceeds to tell you what they are more or
less impersonally, Montaigne’s essays open a window on a remarkable
man searching for answers, playing with questions and revealing the
seemingly trivial aspects of his existence, not always reaching a
conclusion, and not being unduly concerned by that.

Montaigne’s essays include asides, many quotations (usually in
Latin), references, and sometimes seem to imply completely contra-
dictory views, even within a single essay. They often focus on some-
thing quite different from the stated topic – a digression can evolve
into the main topic. Nevertheless they have inspired many generations
of readers most of whom have felt that through his writing Montaigne
was almost present in their lives, even when reading his essays
centuries after his death. His open and perceptive self-revelations, no
matter how specific, point at profound truths about the human
condition that echo with the present. His essays were autobiograph-
ical in a time when autobiography was not a recognised and popular
form: this was not how you were supposed to write philosophy.
Montaigne thought that in a sense his essays were him – they revealed
who he was, and were the place where he discovered that in the process
of writing. The act of writing, the self-observation that it involved,
made him live differently, and, he thought, better. He became more
attentive to what was happening around him, more reflective.

When he discusses philosophy directly Montaigne is not particu -
larly original, drawing as he does on ancient stoicism and scepticism,
mostly quoting from authors who wrote in the Roman period
such as Plutarch and Seneca, thinkers who themselves owed a great
deal to Greek philosophers who had written centuries before them.
Montaigne’s originality lies in his distinctive style, his percep tive
remarks, his use of autobiography, and particularly his openness
about aspects of life most keep private, such as his preferences in sex,
and his mention of the fact that kings, philosophers and ladies all
defecate. Ultimately his writing is driven by a desire to throw himself
into the question of what it means to be human. Like Socrates he
takes seriously the ancient injunction ‘know thyself’ and thinks hard
about how to live and how to prepare for death.

WHO WAS MONTAIGNE?
Montaigne was a sixteenth-century French nobleman who lived in
South Western France near Bordeaux. He was from a wealthy family
who owned large vineyards and he lived in a huge chateau. When he
retired from public life, he would spend most of his time in a tower
of this chateau writing and thinking. Indeed he used his writing as a
way to focus his thinking.

SCEPTICISM
Influenced by Phyrro, Montaigne embraced scepticism, believing that
the only certainty is that nothing is certain – even reason itself may
be unreliable. A favourite phrase of his was ‘What do I know?’
suggesting the answer ‘next to nothing, or possibly nothing at all’.
Human beings know little or nothing. In an act of imagination he
took on the perspective of his cat: ‘How do I know when I’m playing
with my cat that my cat isn’t playing with me?’ he asked. He tried
to understand what it would be like to be his dog, with its heightened
sense of smell, too, thinking through the different perspectives these
animals had on the ‘reality’ that Montaigne experienced. Montaigne’s
own viewpoint was, then, one of uncertainty, and, unlike René
Descartes (see Chapter 6) who although he engaged with the argu -
ments for scepticism, was driven to find something certain, Montaigne
embraced the lack of certainty that he believed to be characteristic of
the human condition.

STOICISM
His desire to conquer himself, given that the world was resistant to
human control, reflects what he took from stoicism: the philosophical
position that emphasises that we are able to decide what we make
of the misfortunes that happen to us, and that a true philosopher
will be able to maintain a calm mind whatever the circumstances by
detaching mentally from the pain and disturbance that most of us
feel when things go wrong. The severest test for a Stoic is the question
of how to approach death and the pain that often accompanies the
process of dying. This was a subject that vexed Montaigne, and is a
recurrent theme in his essays.

ON DEATH
Four out of five of Montaigne’s children died in childhood, his best
friend died of plague, and his younger brother died from an accident
when a tennis ball struck his head behind his ear – he died several
hours later. Montaigne himself suffered a very severe fall from a horse
after a collision with a servant on horseback at full gallop – the impact
almost killed him. The theme of death occurs in a number of his
essays, picking up from the ancient philosophers’ belief that to
philosophise involves learning how to cope with death, or at least
to distract the individual enough not to be worried any more about
the inevitable end to come. It is central in the essay ‘That to study
philosophy is to learn to die.’

Although Montaigne acknowledged fear of death, and suffered
from it himself, his own experience led him to worry less about this.
Death, he felt, is a natural phenomenon, and when the time comes,
nature will take over. Rather than hide the fact of death from
ourselves, we should think about it often, we should reflect on the
brevity of life and the difficulty of knowing when our own death will
arrive, and the uncertainty about the form it will take. Montaigne
cites approvingly the Ancient Egyptian habit of bringing in a dried
skeleton at the height of a feast as a memento mori. Not openly atheist,
Montaigne nevertheless wrote as if death was final. Echoing Seneca,
he declares that what matters is not how long you live, but what
you do with your time on Earth. He suggested that one of the best
ways of dealing with fear of our own death was to think about death
every day. The process of reflecting on the possibility of our own
death at any moment would, he believed, prepare us well for living
and enjoying the time that we are lucky enough to have alive. He
also described his own experience of near-death, and reflected that
his fear of death itself was substantially less when it seemed imminent
than when it seemed unlikely.

OTHER THEMES
Montaigne’s essays cover such a wide range of topics including
cowardice, fear, cannibalism, prayer, solitude, drunkenness, cruelty
and the resemblance of children to their fathers, that they defy simple
summary. The common thread through them all is Montaigne’s
presence, his willingness to explore the topic in question with hon-
esty, drawing on quotations from ancient writers and his own
experience.

CRITICISM OF MONTAIGNE’S ESSAYS

Too subjective
Montaigne doesn’t always feature on philosophy syllabuses: his essays
are more likely to be on the reading lists of those studying French
literature. One reason for this is that, in comparison with, say David
Hume, or Bertrand Russell, his writing is always intensely subjective:
he begins from his own position and the minutiae of his actual
existence. As he put it, when considering the fact that he changed his
views, sometimes within an essay, ‘I may contradict myself, but the
truth I never contradict.’ This emphasis on truth to the experience
of the particularities of his own life, together with his quirky focus
on the apparently trivial detail, can lead some to dismiss his essays
as interesting and entertaining to read, but not really philosophical
in any important sense. This sort of criticism misses the point and
stems from a narrow viewpoint that treats philosophy as a quasi-
scientific discipline that is always aiming at generality and objectivity

Lack philosophical originality
Another criticism of Montaigne is that there is very little in his writing
that has not been said before by other philosophers. Montaigne drew
heavily from the work of Stoics and the Sceptics and his writings are
interspersed with Latin quotations. Many of his ideas, such as his
views on scepticism and on death were derived directly from ancient
philosophy. Because of this his work may seem to lack philosophical
originality. However, his peculiar style of thinking, his willingness
to illustrate his thought with examples from his own life and
experience, and his frank and open writing style are all highly
distinctive and original. His real originality lies in the way he took
his own individual existence and experience as the subject of his
investigations and derived a general picture of human life and what
matters from that: as he makes clear in the book’s note ‘To the
Reader’, his main subject is Montaigne himself.

GLOSSARY
essay: a translation of the French word ‘essai’ which has connotations
  of ‘an attempt’. For Montaigne the essay was an exploratory
  literary form, a way of finding out what he thought.
scepticism: the philosophical stance of doubting, such as doubting
  the reliability of sensory evidence. Phyrronic sceptics doubted even
  the reliability of reason.
