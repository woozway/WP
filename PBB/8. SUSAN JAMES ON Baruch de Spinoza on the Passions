Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Back

SUSAN JAMES ON
Baruch de Spinoza on the Passions

David Edmonds: Baruch de Spinoza died in 1677—the cause was a lung
illness, probably due to his breathing in of glass dust: he’d spent much of
his life as a lens grinder. Only after his death was his masterpiece, the
Ethics, published. And so it was only posthumously that he earned a
reputation as one of the great rationalists of the age. In the Ethics —a
book written with the formal apparatus of geometry—definitions, axioms,
and so on—he discusses a key concept in his philosophy—what he calls
‘the passions’. What does Spinoza mean by the passions? Sue James is a
Spinoza scholar and professor of philosophy at Birkbeck College.

Nigel Warburton: The topic I want to focus on is Spinoza on the passions.
But before we get on to that, could you say a little bit about who Spinoza
was?

Susan James: The Dutch say that Spinoza is their top philosopher.
He was the son of two Portuguese Jewish immigrants, who had come
to Amsterdam a few years before Spinoza himself was born to
escape religious persecution from the inquisition. They established
themselves within the Amsterdam Jewish community, and that was
the milieu in which Spinoza grew up. When he was in his early
twenties, his father and older brother died. So Spinoza took over his
father’s business and became a merchant, trading with Portugal in
olive oil and dried fruit. However, around this time he began to
express philosophical views that alarmed the rabbis of the
Amsterdam synagogue. He also started to broaden his education,
attending a school run by a colourful ex-Jesuit called Franciscus van
den Enden. V an den Enden taught Spinoza Latin, and introduced him
to a circle of radical intellectuals including merchants, the director
of the Amsterdam theatre, and professionals of various kinds,
several of whom became his friends. Shortly after, for reasons that
we don’t fully understand, Spinoza was excommunicated from the
Amsterdam synagogue and forbidden to associate with other
members of the Jewish community. At the age of twenty-three he
gave up his business and began to live as an independent
philosopher with no religious affiliation. He learned to grind the
delicate lenses needed by Dutch scientists for their telescopes and
microscopes, and started to write philosophy.

NW: So what did he write?

SJ: He began with some relatively brief works in which he tried
out various philosophical ideas that he would develop later on. At
this stage he was deeply influenced by the work of Descartes, whose
philosophy had created a great stir in the United Provinces, and had
given rise to a major split between defenders of an orthodox
Aristotelian approach and advocates of the new Cartesianism.
Spinoza publicly aligned himself with the Dutch Cartesians when he
wrote an exposition of the first section of Descartes’ major work
The Principles of Philosophy, and added an Appendix expounding
some of his own views. That was the first thing he published. So he
became known as a philosopher broadly sympathetic to Descartes,
and began to acquire an international reputation as someone who had
really interesting and wide-ranging ideas about God, nature, human
beings, and how we should live.

NW: But it’s his book, the Ethics, that’s most studied now. It was written
in this bizarre geometrical style. Why do you think he used that style?

SJ: The geometrical style, which was modelled on Euclid’s
geometry, posited a series of axioms and postulates, and used them
to deduce a sequence of theorems, each with its own consequences.
This mode of demonstration was thought to have a unique
epistemological status because it proved its conclusions with
complete certainty, and this is partly why Spinoza uses it. But he is
also drawing attention to the fact that—in the Ethics —he is doing
Philosophy with a capital P. In his view, the geometrical method
delivers incontrovertible conclusions of a sort that can only be
arrived at in philosophy and mathematics. So it’s quite distinct from
the methods used in other types of enquiry such as history or
theology.

NW: Now he had really interesting things to say about the passions. But
what does he mean by ‘passions’?

SJ: To understand that, we need to go back a bit to one of his most
central ideas: that any individual thing, whether a stone or a human
being, has the capacity to maintain itself as the thing it is. Spinoza
calls this its conatus. The conatus of a relatively simple thing will be
rather limited; for example, a stone has some power to resist being
smashed when other things collide with it, but that’s about all. By
contrast, complex entities such as human beings can maintain
themselves in all sorts of physiological and psychological ways—by
breathing, training themselves to sleep better, fighting to the death,
making friends, and so on. These are all ways of holding ourselves
together or, as Spinoza puts it, of making ourselves more powerful.
So the world, as he sees it, is full of individual things, each striving
to persevere in its being; and when a particular individual interacts
with another it may become more powerful, less powerful, or stay
about the same. Spinoza claims that when human beings interact with
other things they experience the resulting changes in their power as
passions. Our fundamental striving to maintain ourselves manifests
itself in our desires. W e experience increases in our power as
feelings of joy, and decreases as feelings of sadness. Within this
basic schema, Spinoza then goes on to explain more specific
passions. But his main claim is that, as we interact with other things,
we’re always striving to make ourselves more joyful and avoid
sadness.

NW: But the word ‘passion’ suggests something passive that happens to
us rather than an action. Is that right?

SJ: Yes it is. Spinoza maintains the classical idea that our passions
register the ways that external things act on us. Here I am,
surrounded by lots of other things that are causing various effects in
me. For example, I am perceiving you, Nigel, sensing the warmth of
the room, and so on. But these perceptions and sensations come with
passions attached. As well as seeing you, I experience you as
increasing or decreasing my power to maintain myself. So, if I
experience you as acting on me in a way that increases my power,
I’ll feel some sort of joy; if the opposite, some sort of sadness.

NW: In what sense, though, are they passive?

SJ: The passivity lies in the idea that you’re being acted on by
something. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that sitting in this room
is making me joyful. My passion or affect is partly the result of what
the things in the room are like. But it’s also partly the result of what
I’m like and how I respond to the things around me. Spinoza thinks
that the way we respond is partly determined by psychological
processes of which we’re largely unconscious, and over which we
have very little control. For example, if this room is a bit like a
different room where I once had a very enjoyable conversation, I’ll
associate the room I’m in now with a pleasant idea of the previous
room, and this will cause me to feel pleasure now. But the whole
associative process may well occur without my being conscious of
the way it is affecting me. So, in this sense, I’m passive in the face of
it. One of the ways Spinoza tries to capture this element of passivity
is by describing the kind of idea that I have of an external thing, such
as this room, as an inadequate idea. Part of what he means is that,
because my idea of the room is the fruit of a particular interaction
between it and me, it doesn’t give me an accurate idea of what the
room is really like. I only get an idea of the way it affects me. For
that reason, passions tend to give us distorted or, as Spinoza
sometimes says, mutilated ideas, and because they are mutilated or
incomplete they may prompt us to act in self-destructive ways. W e
strive to empower ourselves; but when we do this on the basis of
inadequate ideas we often fail.

NW: That’s intriguing because it sounds almost like psychoanalysis: the
sense that I might be projecting things onto my relationship which may or
may not be there in real life.

SJ: That’s right. Freud was very interested in Spinoza, and although
they have completely different theories of the mind, they are trying to
explain some of the same phenomena.

NW: So if the passions just happen to us, could they ever be considered
rational?

SJ: Our passions both are and are not rational, depending on the
standard you use to assess them. Judged by everyday standards,
some passions are rational in the sense that they enable us to act in
ways that maintain or increase our power. For example, it’s not
irrational to feel afraid of a tsunami and try to escape it. However,
judged by these same standards, other passions are irrational. As
we’ve seen, they often give us deeply confused ideas of ourselves
and external things, and prompt us to pursue disempowering courses
of action. So, if we use these everyday criteria, passions may either
be rational or irrational. At the same time, Spinoza also appeals to a
different standard of rationality, in relation to which all passions
count as irrational. As we’ve seen, passions are inadequate ideas.
They’re incomplete and distorted, and don’t give us a true
understanding of what we and the world are like. To correct the
errors that our inadequate ideas embody, Spinoza claims, we need to
stand back from them and get a fuller grasp of their causes. Rather
than just taking our loves and hatreds at face value, we need to work
out how they arise. What causes me to feel joy at this moment? What
causes it to seem that the room is the cause of the joy? And so on. As
we extend our knowledge of the causes of our passions, our ideas of
them become, as Spinoza puts it, increasingly reliable or adequate.
And the more adequate our ideas become, the more we’re able to
think critically about the inadequate ideas from which we started.
W e become able to think about our passions in a new way, and are
better placed to avoid the mistakes to which they would otherwise
give rise. In Spinoza’s view, learning to think in this more
penetrating fashion amounts to becoming increasingly rational. To
reason, he says, is just to think with adequate ideas. But since our
passions are inadequate ideas, they are by definition irrational when
judged by this standard.

NW: Am I right to think that his philosophy is about coming to
understand ourselves as much as the world?

SJ: Yes. Those two have to go together. W e have to understand
ourselves in order to understand the world because we have to
understand the way the world interacts with us. While Spinoza is
interested in the scientific knowledge of the world that so
preoccupies his contemporaries, he’s much more concerned to
discover how we can acquire the kind of moral knowledge that
enables us to live well. That’s really what he’s all about. And that’s
why his magnum opus is called the Ethics.

NW: And a major theme for him was freedom. How do the passions or
emotions relate to freedom for him?

SJ: Spinoza thinks that, in so far as you’re passionate, you’re in
bondage and are unfree. Why, though, does he equate being
passionate with being unfree? Here we come back to the passivity of
the passions. The problem is that passionate people are continually
being acted on in ways they cannot control. They are subject to the
arbitrary effects of other things. The level of their power depends on
how other things act on them. And this, according to Spinoza, is what
it is to be unfree or enslaved. The project of becoming more free is
then a matter of putting oneself in a position where one’s capacity to
maintain and increase one’s power is less dependent on the arbitrary
effects of other things, because one has more control over the way
they affect one. For example, we can increase our freedom by
learning to deal with passions such as grief or fear, rather than
simply finding them overwhelming. At one level, this is a political
project—a matter of creating circumstances in which people are
protected from their own passions. But for Spinoza it is ultimately a
matter of cultivating what he calls reasoning. As we just saw,
reasoning is the process of acquiring more adequate ideas and using
them to gain a true understanding of the causes and effects of things.
It is, Spinoza says, a matter of becoming active by acquiring the
ability to direct the course of one’s own thoughts and actions. The
more active you become, the less your ideas are determined by the
way that things act on you. Or, to put the point another way, you
become less enslaved and more free. By getting a better
understanding of yourself and the world, you extend your power to
deal actively with the situations in which you find yourself. And by
empowering yourself in this way, you generate a sense of pleasure in
your own activity which is, according to Spinoza, a source of
unparalleled joy. So he has this fundamentally Stoic idea that
understanding the world, understanding the causes of your own
passions, understanding what sort of creature you are and what sort
of environment you live in, will be a source of the most tremendous
satisfaction and make you supremely happy.

NW: This seems like an individualistic philosophy, but you alluded to the
fact that he’s got a view about how this relates to politics.

SJ: It isn’t really an individualistic philosophy, because becoming
free is a collective project. Spinoza thinks of each human being as an
extremely tiny part of nature, and thinks that each of us individually
has an insignificant amount of power. So, although I can improve my
lot by extending my rational understanding in the way I described, I
won’t get very far on my own. The only way we can effectively
protect ourselves against the exigencies of our passions is by
tackling the problem as a community, and Spinoza explores this task
in two different registers. In the Ethics he talks about it as a project
undertaken by a community of wise and virtuous people, who
understand the importance of cultivating understanding and
cooperate for this purpose. But in a different work, the Tractatus
Theologico-Politicus, he discusses it as a project that can be
undertaken by ordinary people who are mostly motivated by their
passions. If people of this kind are to effectively increase their
power, they first need to live in moderately propitious political
circumstances. How, then, do you build a political community that
will foster the growth of understanding, thus generating the greatest
pleasure of which human beings are capable? Ideally, Spinoza
argues, such a political community would be a democracy in which
everyone plays a part in the cultivation of reason and becomes as
free as they are able to. It has to be admitted that democracy, as
Spinoza understands it, is by modern standards a very limited affair
in which women, servants, the poor, and a number of other groups
have no voice in political affairs. But, I think, nonetheless, that there
is in Spinoza’s philosophy a kind of urge or aspiration towards a
maximally inclusive democracy. And in both his accounts, becoming
more rational and learning to live well is a collective enterprise.

NW: And what part does God play in all this?

SJ: For Spinoza, God is everything there is. He eschews the idea
that God exists apart from nature, as the creator of nature or anything
of that sort. At one point in the Ethics he talks about ‘God or nature’,
seeming to say that they’re really the same thing. That isn’t exactly
right. But it is roughly right. If you think of all the causal power there
is, that’s the power of God. It follows that we are in some sense ‘in’
God, and our power is part of His power. I think Spinoza believes
that, as we become more rational and active, we become better
integrated into nature and a little more divine.

NW: But, coming back to the passions, is there an appropriate emotional
attitude that we should have towards God or nature?

SJ: Yes, one that Spinoza describes as ‘love’, though love of a
rather rarefied kind, very different from the erotic love or friendship
that we feel for other people. Once we get a proper philosophical
understanding of God we come to realize that He is the immanent
cause of everything that exists, and that all our rational knowledge is
knowledge of God. This knowledge is empowering; and love,
Spinoza says in the Ethics, is a kind of joy that we feel when we
experience things other than ourselves as empowering. So it’s
appropriate to love God, not merely in the sense of feeling a certain
way about Him, but also in the more practical sense of devoting
ourselves to knowing and loving Him better. That’s what a wise or
rational person does.

NW: What do you think is the lasting impact of Spinoza’ s view of the
passions?

SJ: Spinoza is one of the first philosophers who really construed
the passions as an integral part of social and political life. For many
philosophers before him, the passions were dangerous states of mind
that an individual had to learn to moderate and control for himself or
herself. Spinoza not only defines passions as an aspect of our
interactions with other people and things, thus making them
fundamentally social. He also recognizes that the task of modifying
them and limiting the damage they can do is largely a collective one,
and is something that political communities have to grapple with.
Surely, this is an important insight, relevant to contemporary
political philosophers and moral psychologists, and, more broadly,
to all of us.
