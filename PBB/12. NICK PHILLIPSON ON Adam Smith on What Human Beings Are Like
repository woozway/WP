Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Back

NICK PHILLIPSON ON
Adam Smith on What Human Beings Are Like

David Edmonds: Adam Smith is the most famous of all economists. His
contribution to philosophy is less well known. A key figure of the
eighteenth-century Scottish Enlightenment, Smith taught moral philosophy
at Glasgow University, and was a close friend of David Hume. His first
book, The Theory of Moral Sentiments, is now rarely read by philosophers,
but perhaps it should be. We would know much more about Smith if he
hadn’t ordered his executors to destroy his papers. But Nick Phillipson,
now retired from the University of Edinburgh, pieced together the
remaining evidence to write an acclaimed life of Smith. Who better, then,
to give an account of Smith, the philosopher of sympathy, than his
sympathetic biographer?

Nigel Warburton: We’re talking about Adam Smith and his ideas about
what human beings are like. Smith is world renowned as an economist, but
he’s not generally known as a philosopher. Yet you think he was a great
philosopher.

Nick Phillipson: He was a great philosopher, but his philosophy
has sunk to the bottom of the pool, and he has become, over the
years, a one-book man: the author of The Wealth of Nations and the
author of a particular economic theory. Actually, at the end of his
life, he said he preferred his first book, his Theory of Moral
Sentiments, to The Wealth of Nations.

NW: In that book, Smith took a similar approach to David Hume, a great
friend of his.

NP: Yes, he did. Hume and Smith met in the late 1740s when Smith
was in his 20s. Smith laid out his philosophical stall in the next ten
years in lecture courses on rhetoric, moral philosophy, and
jurisprudence. He also tagged his first thoughts about economics on
to the jurisprudence course. The question for historians is: what’s he
up to, what’s the game?

NW: So what is the game?

NP: Well, the game was about the biggest game in the
Enlightenment league: it was to construct a science of man—a
science which would explain how human beings come to be the
people they are, how civilizations have taken the shape that they
have, and how human beings and their governments ought to behave
in the circumstances in which they found themselves. To answer all
this you had to start by defining what human beings are.

NW: His philosophical predecessors saw human beings as pushy, selfish,
egotistical entities, atomized individuals in a society where they tear each
other apart. Thomas Hobbes, for instance, was famous for taking such a
view. What did Smith think?

NP: Smith wasn’t worried about human beings tearing each other
apart; he was worried about human beings been torn apart by the
wild beasts at the dawn of creation. In the notes that his students took
of his lectures there is a fascinating account of the beginnings of
human society. It’s a speculative, or what he called a ‘conjectural’,
account. Human beings are the weakest of all animals, Smith said.
They are physically weak; as individuals, they can’t compete with
any of the other animals: they can’t run, they can’t fight, they have no
hair (he’s wrong about that, actually), so they will freeze. To put it
bluntly, they will die unless they learn to cooperate. In his early
account of where human beings come from, there’s the notion that to
cooperate you have to exchange, and that means inventing some sort
of language. To start with, this was probably a matter of using signs
and sounds—warning someone that there was a tiger behind the tree.
In time, it becomes more sophisticated. Out of this, Smith develops a
theory of language to explain how we have come to be language
users, using a language and a grammar capable of expressing
complex abstract thoughts. And this matters, because the more we
use language and the more we increase our language skills, the
easier it is to communicate and cooperate with others, and the more
sociable we become. And so his account continues: a closely
intermeshed study of how human beings exchange goods, services,
sentiments with each other.

NW: Hobbes in his ‘state of nature’ has people giving up their natural
rights for security. Hobbes recognized the fragility of life in the state of
nature: as soon as you go to sleep, no matter how strong you are, some
weak person could come along and kill you. How different is Smith’s
account of the state of nature from that?

NP: Smith doesn’t think that human beings are necessarily as
predatory as that: wild beasts are more fearsome than other human
beings. However, it is undoubtedly true that there are predatory
human beings, and some human beings have to be treated with great
caution. We are likely to learn this lesson when we start to tamper
with other people’s possessions. In other words, it’s not likely that
someone is going to try and kill me for the love of killing me—let’s
forget about the psychopaths in the primitive world. What’s much
more likely is that they are going to try and pinch my spear. This may
not matter too much in primitive societies in which so many goods
are shared in common. What does matter is when we find that we are
living in a world in which there is scarcity and competition for the
things around us. That’s when we start to think of things like a piece
of land as ‘mine’. Once this happens, we become aggressive and the
reason we become aggressive, in protecting what we feel is ‘my
property’, is not necessarily because of its utility value. It’s because
we now start to see an attempt to seize ‘my property’ as an attack on
me. In this world of exchange and in a world in which the supply of
goods is restricted, the notions of property and person have become
identified.

And what is being knit together is a world in which people engage
in complicated deals—partly to do with honour, partly to do with
things—about rights to property. And when that happens, you
immediately think of that right as something that needs to be
protected. And this calls for a governor of some sort who will
enforce that right. Political society is born.

NW: One of Smith’s and Hume’s contemporaries, Jean-Jacques
Rousseau, saw the process of civilization as corrupting something pure
that had existed in the natural world. Is that how Smith saw it?

NP: Yes, it is. This is one of the most fascinating aspects of Smith’s
moral philosophy. The story goes back to his student days at
Glasgow University in 1736–1740 when he was introduced to the
work of the British philosopher Bernard Mandeville (1670–1733),
one of the most hilarious philosophers you could read and someone
who had a big influence on Rousseau. Mandeville wanted to explain
how human beings, who were the naturally most selfish of animals,
were turned into docile, tractable social animals. He had wonderful
fun talking about educational processes and the tricks our nurses,
teachers, and governors play in order to flatter and bully us into a
state of sociable servility. Smith read Rousseau when he was
working on the text of the Theory of Moral Sentiments, and was
struck by the way in which Rousseau had tweaked Mandeville’s
theory by starting off from the premise that human beings were
naturally a simple and pure species who were corrupted by society
and turned into creatures who had become quite unrecognizable to
themselves. Smith didn’t dispute that the effects of the civilizing
process would change us out of all recognition, but he didn’t agree
with Rousseau that this was a form of corruption—and I regard his
Theory of Moral Sentiments as a sustained reply to Rousseau.

He thinks Rousseau is absolutely right to say that social education
does have the effect of turning us into someone else. But that isn’t the
end of the story. Socialization is a much more complex process than
Rousseau and Mandeville realize. Of course, it begins by us doing
the pretty contemptible thing of trying to behave in ways that will
please others, but it doesn’t take long to realize that we can’t please
everyone all the time. So what happens then? We do something very
simple and natural, but something that no one has thought about
theoretically. We turn away from the crowd. We turn inwards on
ourselves and have interior conversations with ourselves. Smith
describes this as having a conversation with a fictitious person—a
fictitious person he calls an impartial spectator. In fact, in time, our
respect for the opinions of this fictitious man in the breast is likely to
become so powerful that we fear his disapproval more than the
disapproval of real people. Smith thinks that this everyday practice
is of immense importance in shaping our personalities. It’s a practice
that becomes habitual, which teaches us self-reliance, and gives us a
conscience. It’s a self-reliance we come to value for its own sake as
well as for the admiration other people often have for it. And so the
paradox is that we do become unrecognizable to our former selves,
as Rousseau said, but we become the person we think we would like
to be.

NW: Does Smith actually have a story about where this impartial
spectator comes from? Because it seems mysterious. Does our conscience
come from a God-given soul?

NP: No. Smith is, after all, the closest disciple that Hume ever had,
and Hume was one of the most famous infidels in Europe, and
determined to produce a philosophy which didn’t depend at any
point on religious hypotheses. Hume and Smith were both convinced
that all scientific and philosophical systems, all human thought in
fact, has its roots in the imagination. In the last resort, the impartial
spectator is a figment of the imagination, a fiction, and the paradox is
that we come to value the approval and disapproval of this fictional
entity more than that of real people.

NW: Now, my limited knowledge of Smith’s economic theory is all about
the hidden hand, the way that capitalism provides the best solution to all
kinds of complex negotiations. We should let selfish individuals fight out
the best price in the marketplace and that will benefit all of us more than
any organized system.

NP: That is the take that we all have. The idea of an invisible hand
which reconciles private and public interest is always said to be the
most powerful of Smith’s ideas—and it certainly is polemically
powerful. This is a boring thing to say, but it isn’t actually peculiar
to Smith as a theorist of trade. Smith the economist should be seen in
his historical context as a man arguing against a whole culture of
restricting the workings of the land, labour, and capital markets in
the belief that this was the best way of increasing the wealth and
security of a kingdom. Smith wanted to prove that this system
wouldn’t increase the GDP or work in the long-term interest of land
owners, merchants, and workers. What people often forget is that
Smith was a realist in matters concerning the liberalization of the
market. He knew perfectly well that many vested interests would see
liberalization as harmful to their interests, and he knew better than
most that this could lead to serious and dangerous political trouble.
What he wanted was cautious, piecemeal liberalizing improvements.
In fact, it’s worth remembering that Smith may have been a great
philosopher but he was also a very modest one. He didn’t think that
economics or philosophy could ever be an exact science because no
science can be. On the other hand, that’s not what his disciples felt.
And one of the sad stories about the fate of The Wealth of Nations is
the attempt to turn his principles into the basis of a hard science.

NW: But would it be fair to say that Smith saw commerce as a civilizing
force?

NP: Yes. Commerce allowed you to deploy your goods and
resources to increase what he called your individual ‘comfort and
conveniences’. This was a liberalizing process, which would
increase communication between people. The more people were
encouraged to exchange goods, services, and sentiments, the more
they would come to trust each other and the better place society
would be. So, overall, commerce has an ameliorating effect on
social behaviour. But he didn’t deny that commerce would turn up
some pretty ghastly people who think that greed is good. Indeed, one
of the things that’s often forgotten about Smith is that he thought that
one of the tasks of the governments of his day was to keep an eye on
the ‘greed is good’ brigade. In those days, this brigade was made up
not so much of bankers as merchants. He didn’t doubt that we need
these people: but they certainly needed to be watched.

NW: Everybody knows there are things to be learned from Adam Smith’s
economic theory, but what should we take away from his philosophy?

NP: That’s a very interesting question, and not one I’ve ever been
asked before. My students consistently get more out of The Theory of
Moral Sentiments than The Wealth of Nations. I think the reason is
that human behaviour is inherently interesting. Smith encourages us
to think about the ways in which people interact in society, about the
way in which they judge other people, and about the ways in which
we judge themselves. He wants us to think that ethics and social
psychology go hand in hand, and that it’s all a matter of thinking
carefully about the things that we all do anyway. He’s bringing
philosophy to common life. He’s giving us a complicated but
convincing account of how we try to live decently at ease with
ourselves and with those around us. He’s making us all philosophers.
