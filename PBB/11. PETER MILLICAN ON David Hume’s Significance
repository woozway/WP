Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Back

PETER MILLICAN ON
David Hume’s Significance

David Edmonds: As David Hume lay dying, he distressed James Boswell
by awaiting his death calmly while refusing to embrace either God or
immortality. Hume is widely regarded as the most significant English-
speaking philosopher of all time: philosophers still grapple with his ideas
on causation, on induction, on morality. Whether he was an atheist, or
merely an agnostic, is debatable. Peter Millican, a Hume specialist,
believes that he toned down his critique of religion for reasons of prudence
and so as not to alienate his friends. His views on religion, Millican
argues, fit into a wider critique of human reason more generally. And it’s in
what Hume says about the limits of reason that his real significance lies.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we’re focusing on is the significance of David
Hume. For many people, he is the greatest philosopher. Could you say a bit
about who he was and why his work is so significant?

Peter Millican: David Hume was one of the great philosophers of
the Early Modern period, the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
He’s standardly thought of as one of the big three British empiricists,
along with Locke and Berkeley. But I think Hume has a significance
greater than that. He stands apart from all of the philosophers of the
period as the first really modern thinker who developed a view of
human reason which belongs far more naturally with Darwin than
with Descartes or Aristotle, or any of the previous thinkers.

NW: What did come before Hume and what was he reacting against?

PM: What you had in the whole Early Modern period was a
reaction against the medieval world, which had been largely built on
Aristotle. Aristotle’s theory of the world was based on the idea that
everything that happens is fundamentally intelligible in terms of
purposes. You can understand the way that things work in the world
in not only God’s purposes, but purposes within things as well. So, if
you ask why a stone falls to the ground when you let it go, the answer
is that it’s striving to reach the centre of the universe. Why do
heavenly bodies move in circles? They strive to move in circles to
imitate as closely as possible the divine perfection and so forth.

Now, what happened in the Early Modern period as science
developed, and in particular as the theory of the heavens that was
associated with Aristotle got overthrown (Galileo’s telescopic
observations played a major role here), this picture became
displaced by a view of the world based on mechanical science.
People like Galileo and Descartes, instead of seeing the way things
behaved as being determined by purposes or strivings, saw nature as
fundamentally causal, and mechanically causal. Why does
something move? W ell, because it is caused to move by something
else bashing into it, or pushing it, or whatever.

That was taken further in Britain by people like Robert Boyle,
John Locke, and Isaac Newton. They saw this as a huge advance on
Aristotle because, instead of having occult interactions between
things—the mysterious idea that matter might strive to reach a certain
position or anything like that—nature becomes intelligible in terms
of mechanical laws.

NW: So, where does Hume come in here?

PM: What Hume did was to take this notion of intelligibility and
say, ‘Actually, guys, you don’t really understand why anything works
the way it does.’ At the time, people used to point to things like
gravity and say, ‘Gravity is a real problem. How do we explain how
things can attract each other from a distance? Mechanical causation,
billiard balls—that’s fine, but gravity’s far more problematic. How
can a planet be attracted to the sun? It would have to know where the
sun was in order to accelerate in the right direction, and that looks
suspiciously like the sort of occult striving that everyone now
rejects.’ So people considered gravity a real puzzle.

Now, what Hume did was to say, ‘No, actually, the same kind of
puzzle that you have about that, you ought to have even about the
interaction of billiard balls. When one billiard ball bashes into
another, you think you understand why it causes the other one to
move. You think it’s intelligible, but really it isn’t.’

NW: Ok, let’s take that example of billiard balls colliding. I hit the white
one, it hits the red one, the red one moves: the motion is somehow
transferred from one to the other. I can see the cause of the effect.

PM: It is very hard to pull yourself away from this natural way of
looking at things. Hume has a lovely thought experiment for making
his point clear. He asks us to imagine Adam, the first man, created by
God with perfect human cognitive faculties: he’s got perfect sight,
his senses all work well, etc. So suppose that God’s just created
Adam, and in front of him, Adam sees one billiard ball moving
towards another. God says to him, ‘Adam, what do you think is going
to happen when that ball reaches the other one?’

How could Adam even start to work out what was going to
happen? Maybe the ball will stop, maybe the second one will move,
maybe the first one will bounce off it in some direction, maybe the
second one will turn into a frog. How can he know, without prior
experience to call on, what’s going to happen when the two balls
collide? He can’t. And the message is that whenever we make an
inference like that about what’s going to happen, we are always
drawing on past experience. Then the big question is, what right do
we have to do that?

NW: What right do we have to do that? It seems quite reasonable to think
about what’s happened in the past and assume it will carry on along
similar lines in the future.

PM: Hume wouldn’t deny that, in a sense, it’s perfectly reasonable.
But the point he wants to focus on is this: we have no insight into the
nature of things that leads us to make that supposition. It’s a very
natural supposition to make—we do naturally take for granted that
what’s happened in the past will broadly continue in the future. But,
again, Hume has a very nice argument. He asks: ‘What ground could
we give for extrapolating from the past to the future?’ It’s not self-
evident: you can coherently imagine it not continuing into the future
in the same way. Likewise, you can’t give any sort of deductive
proof that it will continue because it’s perfectly coherent that it
shouldn’t continue. And nothing that you sense about objects—for
example, when you perceive the billiard ball—nothing that you learn
directly through your senses tells you about how it will behave in the
future, as we’ve seen in the case of Adam. So what other recourse
do we have? The only other recourse is an appeal to experience. But
appealing to experience is what we’re trying to justify. So when you
try to produce any justification, any argument, any reason for
extrapolating from the past to the future, you can’t.

NW: So you’re saying that, for Hume, trying to justify the idea that the
future will be like the past (by saying that the future has always been like
the past in the past) is almost like pulling yourself up by your bootstraps:
it’s not a satisfactory way of justifying what’s known as induction.

PM: Exactly. That sort of justification would only work if you’re
already persuaded that induction is a rational method of inference.

NW: Presumably, Hume is going to say that we are just relying on some
kind of natural tendency to see the future as carrying on in the same way
as the past.

PM: Yes, that’s right. Again, Hume doesn’t want to say that it’s
wrong that we should do that. The point he’s making is that when we
do extrapolate in that way, we are relying on this brute animal
instinct that leads us to expect the same in the future as we’ve
experienced in the past. He’s not saying we shouldn’t do that, but let
us be aware that its basis is an assumption, an animal instinct; it’s
not founded on any kind of God-like insight into why things behave
as they do.

NW: That idea that we have to see human beings as part of the animal
kingdom must have been quite radical in the eighteenth century.

PM: V ery much so. W e were talking earlier about how the
mechanical view of the world became very popular in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. But man was always excluded.
So Descartes, for example, thought of animals as just material
machines, but he famously drew a very radical distinction between
mind and matter. And a very prominent bogey in the seventeenth
century was the materialist Thomas Hobbes, who denied that there
was an immaterial world; he said that everything was material,
which was anathema in the seventeenth century. People were even
criticized for denying the existence of witches and such things
because it was very important to the world view that, although the
physical world could be understood causally and mechanically, there
was also another world, a spiritual world, a world of mind, which is
quite distinct from the physical world, and we humans partake in
that.

NW: Another important related aspect of Hume’s work is his attack—I
can’t put it any other way—on some of the standard arguments for God’ s
existence.

PM: Yes, although for many years people actually thought of this as
not being central to Hume’s philosophical mission, I think that’s
quite wrong; indeed, Hume wrote more on philosophy of religion
than any other area of philosophy. In the early stuff, he tended
towards self-censorship; he removed from the Treatise of Human
Nature his discussion of miracles, for example. Then in his later
work in the Enquiry, he comes back to religion and is very critical
about it, arguing that it doesn’t stand up to rational scrutiny. Now it
can actually seem very puzzling that Hume takes this line because
many people think of him as an irrationalist. As we’ve seen, he is
indeed sceptical about the pretensions of reason, but in fact, he is at
the same time very pro-science and anti-superstition, which is quite
a delicate balance. W e’ve seen that Hume reduces the basis of
scientific reasoning to an animal instinct—the instinct for expecting
the future to resemble the past. But then he wants to advocate such
reasoning and say that this is how we ought to reason about the
world because it provides the only basis we have for learning from
experience.

NW: How does that apply to particular arguments about God’ s
existence?

PM: Perhaps the clearest example, and it’s a very elegant example,
is the discussion of miracles in Hume’s Enquiry concerning Human
Understanding. Imagine that you’re a religious believer who founds
his belief on stories of miracles. Imagine that you say, ‘So and so
told me a miracle and I believe it.’ What Hume does is to reply,
‘Hang on a minute, why do you believe what they say?’ The answer
has to be that you believe what so and so says because they tend to
tell the truth. Then Hume points out here that you yourself are relying
on induction, you yourself are relying on the assumption that because
so and so has generally told the truth in the past, that’s good reason
for supposing that they will tell the truth in the future. But, in that
case, you ought to be consistent. If you’re going to use induction as
your basis for belief, then you ought to apply induction also to your
understanding of how things behave.

But you’ve never experienced (let’s say) a statue crying. So, if
this person told you that they saw a statue crying, you’ve got a
conflict. On the one hand, you’ve got inductive evidence that they
tend to report the truth, which tells in favour of the statue crying. On
the other hand, you’ve got your own experience of statues which tells
you they don’t cry. So, the religious believer ends up in a conflict
between two inductive arguments, and what Hume says—roughly—
is that the argument based on the uniformity of nature about the statue
will always beat the other one because we know from experience
that people do make mistakes, they are subject to illusion, and they
also lie.

NW: Is there any place for God in Hume’s account of the world?

PM: No, I think that Hume is to all intents and purposes an atheist.

NW: That’s interesting because a lot of people have read his work closely
and think of him not as an atheist but as a very sceptical agnostic.

PM: Hume is quite difficult to pin down on the question of God’s
existence. That’s entirely understandable, given the time in which he
wrote—you could be prosecuted for infidelity at the time and it
certainly would have alienated a lot of his friends if he’d come out
explicitly as an atheist. So, it requires some reading between the
lines of Hume’s texts. He tends, for example, to write pieces in
which the first and/or the last paragraph imply that he’s a believer.
But then when you look at all the arguments in between, they point in
the opposite direction. This was actually a very common trick at that
time; it’s been called ‘theological lying’. Hume’s essay on the
immortality of the soul is a perfect example, but even though its first
and last paragraphs appeal to faith to justify life after death, it was
considered too dangerous to publish during his lifetime. When he
was dying, he told James Boswell that he thought the belief in
immortality ridiculous, and Boswell’s dismay illustrates why Hume
had to be so careful.

NW: To sum up: Hume’s significance is that he attacked the idea that we
have this faculty of reason that allows the world to be intelligible to us in
a transparent way, and also that he removed God from the picture.

PM: Yes, that’s right. These are two sides of the same coin. Prior to
Hume, people thought of the world as designed by a divine
intelligence and saw our own intelligence, our minds, as given by
God so as to enable us to understand the intricacy of his creation. So
the two somewhat go together. What Hume does is to take out the
divine creator, and he says we’ve got no reason to suppose that the
world was created by a perfect being. He also, perhaps inevitably,
displaces us from any ambition of being above nature, so that we
shouldn’t think of our reason as being some faint copy of a divine
faculty, and instead ought to see it as an augmented and very
powerful instance of an animal faculty. Rather than aspiring to any
sort of God-like point of view, we should accept that we’re just
clever animals, and adjust our expectations accordingly. W e can still
aspire to find out how the world works—by observation and
experiment—but we can’t expect any ultimate insight into why it
works that way. And exactly the same lesson applies to our
understanding of ourselves: we too are fully part of the empirical
world, not some separate world of spirits.
