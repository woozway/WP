Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Back

BARRY C. SMITH ON
Ludwig Wittgenstein

David Edmonds: Gardener, primary school teacher, architect, engineer,
war hero, millionaire who gave away most of his money, hospital porter—
and arguably the most significant philosopher of the twentieth century,
Ludwig Wittgenstein was born in Vienna in 1889, the youngest child of a
wealthy steel magnate. He moved to Cambridge in 1911 to study under
Bertrand Russell and to pursue his interest in logic. Russell would write
the forward to the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, the only philosophy
book Wittgenstein published in his lifetime, completed in the trenches of
World War I. The Tractatus, Wittgenstein initially believed, solved all the
fundamental problems of philosophy. But by the time he returned to
Cambridge in 1929 he was having second thoughts. His legendary
charisma, his frenetic mental energy, his beguiling prose, his deep
originality—all helped ensure that a new generation of disciples would
absorb, adopt, and transmit his ideas. Barry Smith is a Wittgenstein expert
and the director of the Institute of Philosophy.

Nigel Warburton: We’re talking today about Ludwig Wittgenstein’ s view
about what philosophy is. He’s often described as a philosopher’s
philosopher.

Barry C. Smith: I think he is a philosopher’s philosopher because,
as well as giving us philosophical ideas, theses, and positions for us
to explore, he’s actually interested in the activity of philosophy.
What is philosophy about? What’s its subject matter? Unlike science,
there is no automatically demarcated domain of enquiry or set of
facts that we’re studying. So, he’s self-conscious, all the time when
he’s doing philosophy, and he’s wondering what he is up to.

NW: In order to make sense of how he got to his later philosophical
views about what philosophy is, we need to fill in some details about his
philosophical background. He began as a student of engineering, came to
England before W orld W ar I to study with Bertrand Russell. What was his
view of philosophy at that point?

BCS: As an engineer, he was interested in rather abstract problems:
he was into aeronautical engineering. But to do that, you had to have
a concern with mathematics and this was where he really began to
have his first philosophical thoughts. What was mathematics about?
What made mathematical statements true? W e don’t doubt that 2 + 2
= 4, but when we arrive at these undoubted truths, what is the subject
matter? W e don’t trip over numbers in the world, we don’t spill our
coffee on them, and yet we seem to be talking about something that’s
absolutely sure and certain. The subject matter of both mathematics
and logic became a central preoccupation, and he found out that in
Cambridge there was a philosopher, Bertrand Russell, who was
interested in the nature of logic, and who had got these questions
going.

NW: But his interest was not just in the philosophy of mathematics; he
was interested in how our thoughts relate to the world.

BCS: All our thinking, if it is in good order, is logically correct
thinking. But what are the truths of logic truths of? What actually
gives us some grip on the idea that there are some things that are
logically right and logically wrong? And again, rather like
mathematics, logic doesn’t seem to describe the world. And yet, if
logic describes something beyond the world, something more
mysterious and transcendental, how does it apply to us in our
thinking and in our lives? So, really, his quest is to find a way in
which logic is in the world and is actually the structure and the
boundary of our thinking.

NW: But how can logic, which is essentially the structure of arguments,
relate to the world at all?

BCS: Well, we come to hold many beliefs about the world, and we
hope our beliefs are true, and we can’t necessarily tell, we have to
go around and find out and check, and look for evidence, and so on.
But if we know to begin with the fact that our beliefs are
contradictory, that we both believe something and believe its
opposite, then we know these beliefs can’t both be true at the same
time. So, unless our thinking is at least consistent, there’s no chance
of it fitting the world, there’s no chance of us getting things right.

NW: So, I can’t believe that I’m in London and in Cambridge
simultaneously.

BCS: Exactly. If you tried to believe that, we would doubt that you
had one or other of these beliefs.

NW: Logic, then, structures the limits of what I can think. And that
presumably was what interested Wittgenstein. He wasn’t just interested in
mathematics per se, he wanted to know about our relationship to reality.

BCS: We want to describe reality. W e want to figure all the ways
reality can be, not just as it is, but as it could be. Logic seems to
provide us with some limits to the way things could be. It could have
been raining today; you could have been in Oxford instead of in
London; but it’s not the case that you could have been both in Oxford
and not in Oxford at the same time. So, what is it that provides this
logical boundary or logical constraint on the way reality could be?

NW: One aspect of his answer was what’s come to be known as the
picture theory of language.

BCS: Yes. If you think that language can describe states of affairs, it
can describe situations. W e’re sitting in a room just now recording
this podcast, but if we think of all the ways we can describe the
world, and if we could do that exhaustively, then we could use that
very language through rearrangement of parts of the sentences into
new sentences to describe not just the way it is, but the ways it could
be, alternative versions of the world. If you have sentences which
work to describe reality correctly, Wittgenstein thought they were in
some sense pictures of reality—just as a picture of reality, like a
painting, needn’t be of an actual scene, it’s of a possible scene.

NW: At that stage, what did he think the activity of philosophy should
be?

BCS: He wanted to see how philosophy should describe the limits
of language as the limits of how things could be in reality. The job of
the philosopher is not to describe reality; perhaps that’s the job of
scientists. But, instead, what we should say is, ‘Here is how
language can actively be used to describe how things might be, and
here are the limits on what we can think or describe as the way
reality could be.’ The limits of language for Wittgenstein were the
limits of reality.

NW: So, if I’ve got this straight, part of what Wittgenstein was trying to
do was distinguish what we can talk about and make sense of from mere
nonsense.

BCS: Yes. But there are two types of nonsense, for Wittgenstein. If
you put words in any order, ‘the man of of the on’, for example, that
doesn’t make any sense. But Wittgenstein was also interested in
statements which purport to describe reality but (he thought) didn’t
do so. They might nevertheless show us something important about
reality. When you say that a proposition cannot be both true and false
at the same time, you’re not describing a fact purporting to picture
some part of reality, but it’s nevertheless showing you some of the
limits and boundaries on how we can describe reality, or on how
reality could be. So, for Wittgenstein, some of these nonsensical
statements were actually quite illuminating. The laws of logic, the
limits of intelligibility are the ways of showing what those limits are
without stating them.

NW: Wittgenstein thought he’d solved the problems of philosophy. He left
Cambridge; during W orld W ar I, he was in the trenches with the Austrian
army; but he gradually came to realize that there were some things that he
needed to get straight still, and came back to Cambridge in 1929. Then he
developed a new conception of language. Instead of thinking of language
in terms of a picture of the world, he put forward this notion of meaning as
use.

BCS: Yes, I think he comes back to philosophy because, although he thinks
he has solved the problems of philosophy in the Tractatus, stating what the
limits of intelligible thought and language are, he realizes that philosophers
still hanker after some form of explanation and he wonders what we want
when we want explanations. What are we trying to explain? He comes to
diagnose our problem in philosophy as the search for explanations where
none can be given. He recommends instead a way of avoiding explaining and
returning just to describing how things actually are. So, now his view of
language is, ‘Don’t try to explain how language would work if it were in
perfect order. Try to describe how it really works; just see how we use
language.’ So, philosophers who thought of revising language to make it fit
for the job of describing science or mathematics, wanted a revision to our
ordinary practice. But, as Wittgenstein pointed out, we don’t have any
problems with our ordinary practice: we use language as second nature,
we’re comfortable with it. If we’re going to understand how it actually
works, as opposed to how philosophers think it should work, we ought to just
describe it. But to do that you have to attend to it very carefully and get it
right.

NW: That makes him sound more like a sociologist describing how we
happen to use language. That’s not a traditional picture of what a
philosopher does.

BCS: The philosophy is in trying to persuade you that you don’t
need explanations: you just need description and you need a lot of
philosophy to persuade other philosophers to accept that. But in
terms of describing language, he wants to describe language as it is
actually used, look at how it is put to work by ordinary folk, and yet
he knows there is such a thing as using language correctly or
incorrectly. If a word is to have any meaning, it has to have a definite
application; we can’t use a word to name just anything we like and
suppose the word still has some significance. W e use the word ‘red’
for red things, and if we didn’t use it selectively, that way it
wouldn’t have that meaning. So, now, he’s interested in what it is
that makes the difference between the correct and the incorrect use of
a word. He thinks that, when we use a word correctly, we seem to be
following a rule for its correct use. But now he’s left with the
terrible philosophical problem of explaining what it is to follow
rules, and to follow them correctly.

NW: On that question, we’re in danger of going down a completely
different track. I want to pull this back to the role of philosophy. He said
philosophy begins when language goes on holiday. I wonder if you might
give us a gloss on what this means.

BCS: He thought philosophy was in trouble when language went on
holiday: in other words, when we start using language in a
philosophically prescribed way, instead of using it in its normal
way. People are not puzzled by their use of language; they use these
words and they listen to these sounds, and they hear them as
immediately meaningful. And yet philosophers make this seem a
puzzling activity. How could these mere sounds, these mere noises,
manage to convey something about the inner contents of my mind?
How could they make it available to you, another mind, who doesn’t
have the ability to scrutinize my thinking. Now, Wittgenstein saw
those philosophical puzzles as only arising because people had
misconceived the relationship between language and thought, and the
relationship between language and other people. In the Tractatus,
he’s worried about the relationship between language and reality.
How does language capture reality? What are the limits of language
that show us the limits of reality? By the second period of his
philosophical life he’s interested in the relationship between
language and us. W e seem only to become creatures capable of
wondering, thinking, discussing, philosophizing when we’re already
in the midst of a language, when we already speak language and use
it to communicate our thoughts to one another. And he wanted to
show that language not only involves a relation to other people,
without which you couldn’t have meaningful significance for your
own words, but that language also ties you to the world. There is no
predicament of the sort the Cartesian philosopher envisaged, of us
sitting by ourselves in our own library, wondering if anybody else
existed and if we were the only thinkers. That picture was deeply
flawed, because even to have the materials to start thinking and
asking those questions you’re already immersed in a practice of
using words in exchange with others in a way in which you all
jointly maintain the significance of that language.

NW: So that’s what he means by ‘meaning as use’. Part of that is a
reaction against a view of philosophy which comes down through Plato
where we have Socrates—the character in Plato’ s dialogues—challenging
people to define key concepts such as ‘justice’: and the people he asks
prove incapable of actually explaining it. What Socrates is trying to do is
get someone to give necessary and sufficient conditions for something
being justice. But Wittgenstein challenges the notion that a definition in
use is anything like that.

BCS: Yes, he does and he uses a rather good and a rather famous
example. W e all know what it is for something to be a game. W e play
games with one another in teams, sometimes by ourselves, and the
question is, what are the conditions for something to be called a
game? How do we use the word ‘game’, how do we define it? And
Wittgenstein points out that any set of conditions that you come up
with which are supposed to define the meaning of the word ‘game’
will fail to cover some cases that we happily recognize as cases of
games. So, what is it that all of these cases have in common that
makes them all equally covered by that term? And his answer is not
going to be a single set of necessary and sufficient conditions; rather,
there is going to be a family resemblance between the activities of
one game and another, as in the way that members of a family might
resemble each other and have more or less distant resemblance to
other members of the family. W e don’t all have our father’s nose, but
there is some way in which we become grouped together by
resemblances between members of that family. Similarly, in the
activities we call games, they are enough alike, they are enough
overlapping, for us to think of this as a family resemblance.

NW: So, football is a game with winners and losers, teams, and a ball. So
is baseball. Lots of similarities there. But a game may be just one person
throwing a ball against a wall and catching it: with no winning or losing.
So there are lots of different features in things we call games. There is no
single essence, no essence of gameness that makes all these things games.

BCS: Yes, that’s right. Ring-a-ring-a-roses played by children is a
kind of game but it doesn’t have winning or losing. It’s not even
about getting better at doing it. It seems to be just about the repetition
of a certain activity over and over again. Now, the idea that there’s
no essence to a game, there’s no single thing it has, is, as usual with
Wittgenstein’s philosophy, going to illustrate a much bigger moral.
Because the moral he’s interested in is the fact that there’s no
essence to language. In the Tractatus, he had seen language as a
logically, perfectly ordered, functioning system doing a very precise
job. Here we see a number of different uses that language is put to,
but there’s no single thing they have in common, there’s no
underlying essence to language. He also has a very nice metaphor of
how language is an organic entity. He talks about being in a city and
starting in a square and moving into different districts and coming to
know some of them and re-encountering them from different
directions. And realizing that the city doesn’t have buildings of all
the same period but that it’s been laid upon again and again with new
architectural styles and finding one’s way into these different periods
of time and space is one way in which we see the organic growth
and outgrowth of language.

NW: There’s also the image of different levers that look the same but you
find they’re pulling different strings, different mechanisms. These images
are characteristic of the unusual way in which Wittgenstein did
philosophy.

BCS: It’s very unusual. He tends to work by example more than
anything else. But the real philosophical work is trying to understand
what the example is doing. He thinks that we have to be reminded of
how language works instead of how we believe it works. Bertrand
Russell and perhaps his earlier self thought that the real essence of a
language was that words stood for objects, the naming relation, the
relation between the name and the thing—this was the foundation of
all language. But when we get the Philosophical Investigations,
which is published posthumously in 1953, we realize that a word has
more uses than just standing for an object, it could also describe an
activity. He imagines at the very beginning of the Investigations, a
builder and an assistant, and the builder is asking the assistant to
bring more materials and he says ‘slab’. Now ‘slab’ can either be
the name of the piece of concrete he wants, it can be a request to
bring the slab towards him, it can be a gesture suggesting there are
no more slabs left and the assistant will have to get them. The very
same word can perform different functions. That’s one side of the
story. The other side of the story is not to think time and time again
that because, on its surface, language looks the same that it’s actually
performing the same function. Sometimes we have sentences that
describe the way reality is—it might describe the number of books
in this room or the arrangement of the furniture. But we have
sentences which look equally fact-stating but are not actually
descriptions of a state of affairs.

NW: Can you give me an example?

BCS: Yes. When we use psychological predicates to describe our
mental states—I have a headache, I’m in pain, I’m wondering
whether Nicolas Sarkozy will be elected in the next French election
—these look like fact-stating sentences, like the way we might
describe the railway timetable, the weather, the arrangement of
furniture. But for Wittgenstein, they’re not doing any such thing.
These sentences are not describing a state of affairs as though it was
an object I could scrutinize and then comment on. They actually
express my state of mind. He thinks that by uttering this sentence I
literally speak my mind and I put it into public view for others rather
than report on it by observing it myself.

NW: This was all in the Philosophical Investigations. And in that book,
Wittgenstein delivers a completely novel view of philosophy, where the
point of philosophy is to dissolve problems that people get into by
misusing language, by pushing language too far. So philosophy has
become a kind of therapy, he talks about showing the fly the way out of the
fly-bottle.

BCS: I think the idea of therapy is supposed to be to help those who
need help, and who are already in trouble. And Wittgenstein’s idea
of philosophy as therapy is first of all to coax people into the
problems to see why it’s tempting to think in the way we do as
philosophers, and then to try to explain to them why these ways of
thinking are actually setting up spurious problems. And if they
understand the situation properly and what they’re doing and the
activities they’re engaged in, they’ll no longer find them puzzling.
But you’ve got to be first tempted to fall into the mistakes, and to
make those mistakes. And he invites us, by his writing, and by his
style—usually by engaging with an imaginary interlocutor who’s
putting problems and puzzles and questions to him—to fall into those
mistakes, to feel ourselves in the grip of those problems. Because
only then, when you see that they’re tempting, can you exorcize them,
can you do real philosophy to get yourself out of there.

NW: So have you got an example of how philosophers get bewitched by
words?

BCS: There’s a nice example Wittgenstein gives when he’s dealing
with a question from his philosophy student and literary executor
Elizabeth Anscombe. Anscombe says to Wittgenstein, ‘You can see
why people thought the sun went round the earth.’ ‘Really? Why?’,
he says. And Anscombe replies, ‘well it looks that way’. And
Wittgenstein remarks, ‘And how would it look if the earth went
round the sun?’ There we can see very nicely the way our thinking
can mislead us if we don’t see the whole picture. And by effecting a
change in the way of seeing, not a change in the facts, the problem
goes away.

NW: We’re in the twenty-first century. Wittgenstein was very much a
philosopher of the twentieth century. What was his impact on philosophers
who’ve come since?

BCS: Many philosophers have regarded Wittgenstein as creating
some really rather good problems, some very haunting problems that
we are still exercised by. And even though it may have been the
official Wittgenstein moral to see these problems as things we
should resist or that needed to be dissolved, philosophers have
continued to find them important and troubling, and gone on working
on them. I think one of his lasting legacies, though, perhaps beyond
philosophy, is the idea of trying to give up the need to explain
everything. Now, we’re convinced that science will find
explanations of so many things, states of the brain, our emotions, and
so on. And Wittgenstein very poetically and very aptly reminds us
that sometimes explanations are not needed or won’t help. In his
remarks on J. G. Frazer’s book, The Golden Bough, he says ‘to the
man who has lost in love, what will help him, an explanation?’ It’s a
question clearly inviting an answer ‘no, not an explanation. That’s
not needed and it won’t help.’
