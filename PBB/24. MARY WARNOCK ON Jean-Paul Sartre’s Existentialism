Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Back

MARY WARNOCK ON
Jean-Paul Sartre’s Existentialism

David Edmonds: Jean-Paul Sartre, the twentieth-century French novelist
and philosopher, was one of the founders of existentialism. He rejected
God and the Nobel Prize for literature; he opposed the Vietnam war and
French involvement in Algeria; he embraced Marxist ideas, but later
changed his mind. Perhaps his longest commitment was to his life-long
companion, Simone de Beauvoir—his relationship to her is usually
described as ‘unconventional’. Mary Warnock is a philosopher who now
sits in the House of Lords; she’s also the author of a book on Sartre.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we’re focusing on is Jean-Paul Sartre’s
existentialism. Obviously, Sartre is one of the best known philosophers of
the twentieth century, not least because of his novels and plays, but he’s
also the quintessential ‘existentialist’. What do you understand by the term
existentialism?

Mary Warnock: I think of existentialism, of which, as you say,
Sartre was one of the founding fathers, as a minor offshoot of mainly
German phenomenology, which Sartre had gone to Germany to study
in 1939. Sartre was not an original thinker, but like our Samuel
Taylor Coleridge, a picker-up of other people’s ideas, sometimes
misunderstanding them, but with a genius for using them at the right
time, just when they will catch and enhance the spirit of the age. So,
existentialism now seems to me as much a sociological as a
philosophical movement; indeed, philosophically it is all but
forgotten.

After the unique mixture of humiliation and courage that marked
France during the war, Paris needed a philosophy that would give to
individuals a belief in themselves and their own powers to see
through humbug and make their own decisions. And this is a large
part of what Sartre gave them, in the kind of flamboyant, essentially
Germanic, metaphysical wrappings so dear to the French.

NW: Sartre described existentialism as the idea that for human beings
existence precedes essence.

MW: Whatever that means! You need to unpack what he meant by
that. I think he meant that there was no given human nature: we all
make our own lives by the choices that we make. That was a very
important thought for him because he argued that everything is a
matter of choice, and if you say that you are bound to do this, or have
to do that, whether you mean you are morally bound to do it or
whether you mean your childhood influences determine you to do
that, whatever you mean, you’re wrong—because actually you could
do otherwise.

NW: And he used this famous example of a student who came to see him
in wartime with a dilemma: should he stay at home with his mother, or
should he join the free French and fight the Nazis?

MW: Yes, that was a wonderfully vivid example of there being a
genuine choice for the student and nobody could make it for him. The
great thing that Sartre brought, certainly to British philosophy, when
he eventually crossed the channel, was his brilliant real examples.
Sartre was a storyteller and dramatist through and through, and his
stories, embedded in the philosophical text, served as proof of the
theories. This was something English moral philosophers were very
bad at doing, and Germans, for that matter. In England there was an
obscure but influential philosopher, H. A. Prichard (1871–1947)
who, in writing on moral theory used absurd, trivial, and highly
unrealistic examples, and that was the tradition. Sartre was like a
breath of fresh air. In his big book Being and Nothingness he had a
story to show what he meant by ‘bad faith’ where a waiter pretended
that he had to get up at 5 o’clock in the morning, he had to attend to
his customers; he’d created a situation in which these duties had to
be fulfilled if he were to fill the role of the waiter properly. But it
was a role, a part he was playing and even overplaying. And once he
had created these duties and obligations, as Sartre said, they sprang
up like partridges all round his feet. He had duties all over the place.
Reading this story, you suddenly recognized that there were lots of
people who were in bad faith in that way: people who wouldn’t
think beyond the fact that they had to get up in the morning and catch
the 8.30 train or whatever it was, and their life was dominated by
these false necessities and the part they had decided to play.

NW: This notion of bad faith is obviously central for Sartre in Being and
Nothingness. Can you say a little bit more about what it is?

MW: Bad faith is pretending to yourself something which if you
thought about it for 5 minutes you would realize was not true. It’s
acting or overacting a part. The waiter, who pretended that he was
really bound by duty, was acting the part—and overacting the part—
of a conscientious waiter. When I read this, I suddenly recognized all
kinds of people I knew who seemed to me to be playing the part of
an Oxford philosopher, or playing the part of a committed mother of
five—and you took on this persona and you pursued it, and actually
you were an actress. And I found this fascinating.

NW: So what is actually wrong with being in bad faith? We’re pretending
to ourselves—but maybe that’s just a condition of interacting socially—we
have to tell ourselves stories like this.

MW: It is true that we have to tell ourselves stories and we do have
to have a narrative of our own life. But bad faith is probably
objectionable only if it is carried too far—to the extent that you may
suspect yourself or even other people—more often other people—of
being insincere, of having no real self, of just being hollow, playing
one part after another. So it was wonderful to have all that blown
away and to be told that you could do anything you like.

NW: But surely Sartre was wrong when he said that we’re completely free
—we're free to choose whatever we want. There are influences upon us
that are overwhelming.

MW: Well, I think he was wrong in two ways. First of all, he was
wrong to discount all the influences from one’s childhood or past
and equally from one’s genetic make-up. But he was more
importantly wrong in saying there was no such thing as actual moral
right and wrong, and that only thinking makes it so. This relativism in
moral philosophy was a very pernicious influence and is actually
itself morally wrong.

NW: That’s interesting because in ‘Existentialism and Humanism’, a
1945 public lecture, subsequently published as a short book, he did say
that when you choose for yourself you choose for everyone, his philosophy
had that universalizable aspect. Sartre was saying that when I make a
choice, say, I choose to marry, that’s not just an idiosyncratic personal
thing: I’m saying that human beings in my epoch should marry, and maybe
have certain kinds of family relationship. I must be choosing the best
choice, otherwise I’m being insincere in some way. And so I act as if
everybody’s acting in the same way.

MW: Of course, one has to distinguish between choices. If you
choose to have a boiled egg rather than a scrambled egg for lunch—
that has no general implications for humanity as a whole. But if you
make a moral choice that you’re going to keep a promise on this
occasion though it’s to your own hindrance, then you are choosing
for humanity as a whole. Now that is what he said in that essay, in
that lecture, but he never said it either before or later. He was
presumably trying to defend his moral theory against the widespread
criticism that it was destructive of morality and essentially self-
indulgent; he was quite capable of stealing an idea from Kant and
using it for his own purposes, and then discarding it. So, it was
probably produced out of some kind of pressure not to be so
relativist, egocentric, in his view of morality as he was at that time
inclined to be. But, of course, later, in the second phase of his life
when he was struggling to reconcile Marxism with existentialism,
then he had to be making choices for the whole of humanity, and he
changed gear completely in the middle of his career. So his second
enormous book (Critique of Dialectical Reason, 1960) really had
little relationship to his original existentialism days.

NW: I find Sartre’s later work incomprehensible. A lot of his later work
was written when he was taking speed and it seemed to have quite a bad
effect on his writing. And perhaps he’d reached the stage when he wasn’t
edited in the way that he might have been as a younger philosopher. Do
you have any thoughts about the style in which he came to write?

MW: It was appalling—absolutely ghastly. I didn’t like the style in
Being and Nothingness, though I enjoyed the anecdotal part of it,
and I enjoyed the huge metaphysical structure that it was all built
around. But it appalled me when I first read it. However, it was
nothing compared to the incomprehensible and really shoddy way
that the Critique of Dialectical Reason was written. But I don’t
think it was caused by a failure of proper editing. I think Sartre
himself was in bad faith. He was playing the part of a French
intellectual, specifically a great philosopher with a vast theory of
history that would change the world, and he hardly knew, in his
befuddled state, the difference between reality and pretence.
However, we must remember that, when the Critique came out in
1960, we hadn’t yet had the benefit of yet more incomprehensible—
deliberately incomprehensible—French philosophers such as
Jacques Derrida, who really are unreadable, and meant to be so.

NW: Meant to be so? Why would they want to be incomprehensible?

MW: Because they wanted to be profound. They were unduly
influenced by the German philosopher Martin Heidegger, who
thought philosophy had to have a whole special vocabulary and a
way of going about things that nobody could possibly understand.
From Hegel onwards, one branch of philosophy did delight in
obscurity and I think that’s a totally mistaken view of what
philosophy should be about.

NW: Going back to Sartre, what would you say is his enduring legacy?
You began by saying he’s more or less been forgotten.

MW: He has been forgotten and probably rightly so. But what he
did, historically, was to open our eyes to the fact that moral
philosophy could be an exciting and totally relevant subject,
involved not only in intellectual questions but in emotional questions
as well. I admire him most for his having embraced the philosophy
of Edmund Husserl and the German phenomenologists who thought
you couldn’t separate the intellect from the emotions and who
preceded Wittgenstein in breaking down the distinction between the
inner and the outer. What’s going on in your head is not completely
separate from what is going on in the outside world. When he was
very young Sartre went to Germany to discover what was going on
with the phenomenologists and he introduced Husserl to France, and
wrote a wonderful, terribly overexcited article saying, now at last
we are free from Descartes and Descartes’ dualism, and he saw that,
he understood that, and he emotionally adopted this huge step which
was taken by the phenomenologists and was later explored by
Wittgenstein.
