Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Back

MARY MARGARET McCABE ON
Socrates and the Socratic Method

David Edmonds: According to the dictionary, a question is an expression
of inquiry that invites a reply. No figure in the history of ideas has been
more associated with the question than Socrates—one of the founders of
western philosophy. He gives his name to a type of investigation through
dialogue—the so-called Socratic method. His questions and truth seeking
so annoyed the Athenians that he was tried and found guilty of corrupting
young minds. His punishment—in 399 BC—was death through drinking
hemlock. Professor M. M. McCabe of King’ s College London, submitted
herself to a rigorous questioning by Philosophy Bites.

Nigel Warburton: We’re going to talk about Socratic method; that’s the
method of Socrates. But who was Socrates?

M. M. McCabe: Socrates lived in Athens in the fifth century BC. He
was ugly and disreputable to look at, but a striking and compelling
character—so much so that when he asked, people answered: he
commanded attention all the time from his interlocutors. But this
caused some difficulty in Athens because the questions he asked
were uncomfortable aones—deep questions about why they did what
they did, both individually and collectively—and the Athenians
didn’t like that much. They thought that somehow he was responsible
for subversive elements in the state and in particular for some of the
political difficulties in which Athens was embroiled at the end of the
fifth century. So at the age of 70, in 399 BC, Socrates was executed:
given hemlock to drink. He left a huge legacy to the rest of western
philosophy.

NW: And part of his legacy is the portrayal of Socrates in Plato’ s
writing. Plato was one of his pupils and wrote superbly about Socrates.

MMM: That’s right. There are in fact several different sources for
Socrates’ life. There’s a ribald play by Aristophanes, the Clouds;
there’s some rather hagiographic material by Xenophon; and there
are other Socratic works. But the most important Socratic material is
the collection of dialogues that Plato wrote in which Socrates was
the main speaker: works about his life, his death, and his
conversations with those luckless people who were trying to live
their ordinary lives when Socrates called them to account.

NW: But it’s very important that we have these, because Socrates himself
didn’t write anything down.

MMM: He wrote nothing; he was probably too busy talking. He
supposed that what we should be doing is all the time asking
questions of others and of ourselves about what it is we think, about
what we’re doing, and what it is to think about what we’re doing:
questions, that is to say, both about matters ethical and about matters
epistemological. Let me give you an example: there was an Athenian
called Euthyphro who was an expert on religion. Socrates meets him
when they are both on their way to court: Socrates to defend himself
against the charge of which he was convicted, Euthyphro to
prosecute his own father for the manslaughter of one of his own
slaves. Socrates says to Euthyphro: ‘hang on a minute, are you sure
you know what you’re doing?’ and Euthyphro says: ‘yes, of course I
know what I’m doing, I am an expert’. Socrates’ investigation is in
part about whether Euthyphro is right to think that what he’s doing is
right. But the most significant thing about his discussion with
Euthyphro is his investigation about what it would be to know such a
thing, what sorts of claims you make when you say, ‘I know that
prosecuting my father is the right thing to do’. So the discussion
always works at that double level, both an account of the particular
question at hand, and an account of what conditions there would be
on answering it.

NW: This kind of discussion is actually an example of what we call the
Socratic method—where Socrates meets somebody, challenges their
assumptions, and through asking difficult questions teases out just how
little they know.

MMM: Exactly. What he’s trying to explain to us is not only how
little they know but how little they understand about what it would
be to know something. What we understand as the Socratic method is
this business of continuous questioning; but we need to notice how
complex that turns out to be. One has to think about the logic of the
Socratic method as well; when he considers somebody’s position in
this sort of question and answer, what he is looking at is a collection
of views that they hold, rather than investigating some single
proposition and working out whether it’s true or false. So Socrates is
trying to see how everything that a person believes fits together. You
can see how this makes the Socratic method a very complicated and
deeply controversial process, because you’re asking people the most
extraordinarily impertinent questions about what they really think,
and forcing them to face the exceedingly uncomfortable thought that
what they think is somehow incoherent or inconsistent, or dismally
incomplete.

NW: And a lot of people found him intensely irritating because of that.

MMM: Well they killed him; they had had enough of all of this, and
so they bumped him off.

NW: The person engaged in the Socratic method is not a thoughtful
individual in a library: he’s someone scrutinizing ideas in the marketplace,
talking to people.

MMM: That’s exactly right; Socrates thinks that you can have a
conversation with no holds barred and find things out that way.
There’s no suggestion that somehow or other we’re stuck inside our
own heads and can’t do things collaboratively or collectively; he
doesn’t start from a position of scepticism about whether there are
other minds, or suppose that I’m limited to my own subjective
experience. Instead, Socrates thinks (or Plato shows us a Socrates
who thinks) that these conversations are genuinely collaborative
activities, that it is really possible to find things out together. And
from our modern perspective we’re inclined to think that’s a bit
overstated, that he’s being ironical. People often say about Socrates:
‘Oh, well, he says he wants to talk with his friends, but he doesn’t
really mean it, because he knows he’s a clever-clogs and they’re
really stupid—all he is really doing is showing them up.’ That seems
to me to assume something about the tone of these discussions which
may not be there. I think one should read what Plato has him say at
face value and take Socrates to think that these question and answer
sessions are mutually illuminating, both about the question in hand,
and about what it would be to answer it.

NW: Are these conversations good because they lead to knowledge or are
they somehow intrinsically good because they’re conversations?

MMM: The first thing to remember here is that even when the
conversations themselves end in impasse, in aporia, they don’t fail
to make any progress at all: often both the reader and the
interlocutors find out a great deal en route about how thought and
explanation and knowledge ought to work. Then, second, one might
reflect a bit on what Socrates might be committed to in asking all of
these questions: why it is worth doing at all? Why is this sort of
uncomfortable conversation something we should care about, let
alone die for? Some think that Socrates’ interest in knowledge is
practical—that we want to know so that we shall be good at getting
things right, making accurate decisions, getting hold of whatever we
need or want, arriving at satisfying our best interests. On such an
account, Socrates would think that knowledge is worth having for
instrumental reasons—for whatever goods it can provide us with,
not for any value it might have in itself. But this picture of Socrates
as seeking to calculate the best outcome, or to assemble the
maximum amount of goods, sits ill, I think, both with the portrait we
are given of a man careless of fame and fortune, and with his
obsessive questioning, his constant interest in knowledge itself.
Instead, the way to think about Socrates is by means of his own
dictum—that the unexamined life is not worth living.

NW: What does Socrates mean when he says the ‘unexamined life is not
worth living’?

MMM: First of all think about it as a life. What Socrates is asking
us to consider is a whole life, not a collection of goods that we might
gather together one day or the next. So the focus is away from
individual pieces of practical reasoning or the acquisition of
particular goods, or even from the amassing of fortune, the searching
for fame, and towards something that might have both the continuity
and the structure of a life, centred on the person who lives it, rather
than the things they acquire along the way. Secondly, think about
what might be the objection to the unexamined life, or what might be
the demand that we examine it. There might be two ways of
understanding that demand: that we examine the life; or that we
recommend the life of examining itself. If I am right that the Socratic
method is as interested in the conditions for knowledge and
understanding as it is in the answers to particular ethical questions,
then we might conclude that what Socrates is interested in is the life
of examining itself. So it would be that process of constant
questioning, of making sure that your principles of reasoning and
your processes of reasoning are honest and consistent, fit together
and are things for which you’re willing to be responsible, that
characterizes, and even creates, the life that is worth living.

NW: Does that then mean that all we need to do is go around questioning
all the time to lead a good life?

MMM: It might be depressing, mightn’t it? Perhaps you would end
up alone and friendless (not to mention the hemlock). And perhaps
you would then be someone for whom the lives of others were
nothing but the instruments to your own reflection, and the features of
the lives that we think are ordinary would be of no account at all—
all that would matter would be this sort of austere intellectualism:
that would be all there is to life, morality, and everything. This goes
down in the tradition as the question of whether the wise man (or the
virtuous man) is happy on the rack. But it doesn’t follow from what
Socrates says about the examined life that the examination is all
there is to a life; the examined life could be the central explanation
or condition of what makes this a good life, without the
examination’s being all there is to it. So you can have friends, and
love, and even do all sorts of frivolous things, and the life still
counts as examined, if indeed you have the examination at its core.
Socrates doesn’t need to be committed to saying that the wise man is
happy on the rack—he just needs to be committed to the view that if
you’ve got two chaps on the rack, one wise and one not wise, the
wise one’s going to be better off.

NW: That’s really interesting because of this ancient injunction ‘know
thyself’. Y ou might think the implication is you have to introspect, go into
the wilderness, and think about your life away from other people. But for
Socrates it’s an essentially social activity.

MMM: That’s right. Supposing you try to work out what it is to be
reflective; you might think, ‘being reflective requires me to wander
off into the wilderness, and worry’. I think that Socrates thinks being
reflective is having a perspective on what you think that is detached
—looking at, reflecting on the things that you think, as it were, from
outside. But one of the ways in which you can do that best is in
conversation, because what conversations do is to provide you with
differences of perspective. And he might think, further, that one of the
reasons to care about working out our lives like this, is that doing
things together just matters, that social engagement is itself
important, both for love and for knowledge.

NW: Socrates claimed that he had nothing to teach; nevertheless, is
there something we can learn from Socrates today?

MMM: If Socrates thought we’d learnt something he would still not
have thought he’d taught us. But I think he was right about something
important. It seems to me that if we are involved in education—
whether we’re being educated or doing the educating, or, best of all,
both at once—the Socratic method is a fundamental feature of the
whole business. It doesn’t constitute the whole of education, but it
constitutes something at the core of what we might think education
properly is: to discuss with others in this open-minded, open-ended
way that allows them to reflect on what they think and us to reflect
on what we think, without dictating, without dogma, without
insistence, and without imperative. And what the interlocutors are
asked to do, if you like, is to be true to themselves: to be sincere
about their beliefs and to be honest about how their beliefs fit
together and to have some respect for their companion. All of that, I
think, is a lesson that we do rightly learn from Socrates.

NW: What are the implications then for you as somebody inspired by
Socrates’ teaching within quite a constraining university curriculum?

MMM: The standard ways that we have of teaching in universities
are ways that Socrates wouldn’t acknowledge as proper methods of
coming to understand. For example, the lecture: it’s actually
impossible to lecture Socratically, since there is no conversation—
Socrates complained all the time about ‘long speeches’, I think,
because they just fail to engage with the other person in the right
way. Socrates certainly wouldn’t approve of examinations in the
contemporary sense, because they suggest that there is a right answer
and a wrong answer, and he wouldn’t think about things in those
terms. Although he doesn’t deny that there is truth and falsehood, he
thinks that knowledge and understanding don’t come piecemeal like
that, and are not checked by that kind of test. He wouldn’t like bite-
sized courses, modules, whatever one likes to call them. He
wouldn’t think you can start here and finish there, and get it right
about metaphysics, for example—because he thinks that there are no
lines of demarcation between one question and another. The Socratic
method is demanding and extreme; but we can see that it is a model
that one needs to bear in mind all the time. It keeps you honest just a
little bit; it stops you from thinking, ‘oh yeah it’s easy, you know, I
can go and give a few lectures and then I’ve done my job’. That’s not
what doing your job should look like—especially in philosophy.

NW: W ould you describe yourself as Socratic?

MMM: I wish I could. I’d like to be. But it’s very hard!
