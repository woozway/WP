Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Back

CLARE CARLISLE ON
Søren Kierkegaard’s Fear and Trembling

David Edmonds: God tells you to kill your son. Should you obey His will?
Søren Kierkegaard was a nineteenth-century Danish philosopher and
Christian theologian. He had a prolific but short life: he died in 1855 aged
42. In his book, Fear and Trembling, written, like several of his works,
under a pseudonym and in different voices, Kierkegaard focuses on the
biblical story of God’ s call on Abraham to sacrifice Isaac—and on the
anguished choice Abraham then faces. Fear and Trembling is one reason
why Kierkegaard is credited with being, among other things, a father of
existentialism. Clare Carlisle is a Kierkegaard scholar at King’ s College,
London.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we’re considering is Søren Kierkegaard’ s
book Fear and Trembling. It’s a book that focuses on a particular biblical
story.

Clare Carlisle: It focuses on the story of Abraham and Isaac from
the Hebrew Bible. God commands Abraham to take his only son
Isaac up to Mount Moriah and to sacrifice him there. Abraham
embarks on a three-day journey, takes Isaac to the summit, prepares
the altar. Isaac is lying there on the altar and Abraham raises his
knife and then as he does so, an angel says, ‘You don’t need to
sacrifice Isaac, you can sacrifice a ram instead.’

NW: Kierkegaard turns this story into philosophy, by exploring some of
its implications.

CC: Yes, that’s right. Kierkegaard uses the story to make several
points about Christian faith. Abraham is often described as the father
of faith. So, Kierkegaard offers an interpretation of the story that
raises questions about the nature of religious faith and, specifically,
Christian faith because that’s the tradition that Kierkegaard himself
is thinking and writing within.

NW: But he does it not in his own voice but through the voice of a
pseudonym.

CC: The book is written under a pseudonym who’s called Johannes
de Silentio, or, in translation, John of Silence. When the book was
first published in 1843, Kierkegaard’s name didn’t appear anywhere.
So, on the face of it, the book is written by this character called
Johannes de Silentio. He’s not just a pseudonym, he’s not just a name
that Kierkegaard adopts: he’s a character in his own right. He has his
own perspective, and this is all part of Kierkegaard’s literary
strategy, because he wants to get the reader to reflect and to ask
questions.

NW: Encouraging the reader to think things through from the perspective
of a pseudonymous author is something that he does in much of his work.

CC: Kierkegaard’s authorship splits into what’s called the aesthetic, or
pseudonymous, literature and those texts that Kierkegaard signed with his
own name: the latter are usually explicitly religious in tone. But there are
many pseudonymous works, and many different pseudonyms, and they often
reflect, indirectly, on religious questions.

NW: In Fear and Trembling, Johannes de Silentio explores the story; he
takes us through some possible scenarios.

CC: The book has several different sections, but one of the earliest
sections is called ‘Atunement’, and there several different versions
of the story are told. In one of these interpretations, Abraham
despairs; in another interpretation, he refuses to sacrifice Isaac; and
so on. This offering of different interpretations serves a few
purposes. One is to emphasise that there are various ways in which
Abraham might have responded to God’s command. This helps the
reader to focus on Abraham’s response itself: in particular, on the
existential situation that Abraham was being put in, and the fact that,
when he was faced with this command, there were several possible
ways of responding to it. His response was his choice; he chose one
possibility, which was to respond with faith—but of course there
were different options open to him.

It also gets the reader to focus on the journey that Abraham makes.
Kierkegaard thinks that people often go straight to the conclusion and
say, ‘It was alright in the end, he didn’t have to sacrifice Isaac.’ But
Kierkegaard wants to remind the reader of Abraham’s journey, the
fact that he had to walk for three days. He wants to emphasise the
anguish that Abraham must have felt. He also wants to emphasise
that each physical step that Abraham takes expresses and symbolizes
his repeated commitment to the decision that he’d made; and this is a
model of existence in general: the fact that we’re always in the
process of becoming, we’re temporal. So, at each moment, we are
renewing our actions, choosing again in whatever situation we find
ourselves.

NW: From a rationalist perspective, just because you hear or receive a
message that you ought to sacrifice your son, it doesn’t follow that you
should sacrifice your son. Most of us, put in that position, would question
very hard the source of the message.

CC: That’s right. This is something that Kierkegaard wants to
accentuate in Fear and Trembling. It’s emphasised very strongly that
Abraham’s actions and decisions can’t be understood through
reason; they’re not rational. They can’t be justified on any ethical
basis: they’re immoral. Kierkegaard wants to highlight the fact that
Abraham’s faith appears to be paradoxical—it appears to be morally
abhorrent.

NW: So it’s morally abhorrent but yet conventionally approved of
because the obvious reading of the Bible is that Abraham was a good guy:
he did the right thing.

CC: That’s right, and that’s precisely what Kierkegaard wants his
readers to question—because Kierkegaard perceived among his
fellow Christians a kind of complacency, an assumption that faith
was something easy. It was something that one is simply born into by
virtue of growing up in a nominally Christian society, and involves
going to church, going through the motions of being a Christian.
Kierkegaard wants to challenge that kind of complacency, the
assumption that people have that they are already Christians.
Kierkegaard thinks that this assumption is something that blocks the
project of becoming a Christian.

If you think you’re a Christian already you don’t think it’s any kind
of existential task. So Kierkegaard is trying to unsettle people who
might have had a fairly uncritical, unquestioning acceptance of the
story of Abraham, that Abraham is the father of faith. Kierkegaard is
saying, ‘If Abraham is the father of faith, then what is faith? What
does it require of us?’ It seems to be a terrible thing that cannot be
rationalized, that can’t be based on any ethical grounds. So what is
it?’ Other questions that Kierkegaard wants to accentuate are: ‘What
if Abraham was wrong, what if he was mistaken?’, ‘What if it
wasn’t God’s voice that he heard?’, ‘What if it was some kind of 
hallucination?’ Kierkegaard relates this possibility of doubt to the
situation of Jesus’ disciples. His disciples could’ve been mistaken;
they could’ve doubted who Jesus was. They didn’t have the outcome
to fall back on, the outcome of the success of Christianity.
Historically, in that situation, they didn’t know what the future held,
just as Abraham didn’t know that Isaac was going to be given back
to him.

NW: So it’s a bit like the Socratic method. Socrates would take something
which people took for granted and actually reveal to people that they
didn’t know what they thought they knew. Here, faith seems to be central to
Christian teaching. But God’ s putting a very strange demand upon
believers—to have faith in the absence of evidence.

CC: Kierkegaard saw himself as a kind of Socrates of
Christendom; he was interested in Socrates and inspired by
Socrates. He wrote his doctoral dissertation on Socrates, and there
are very clear parallels. Just as Socrates thinks that people assume
that they possess knowledge and that assumption means that they
don’t bother seeking it again, Kierkegaard thinks that people assume
that they’re Christians, and this assumption prevents them from
seeking to become Christians. So there’s a clear parallel with
Socratic philosophy that Kierkegaard himself was very conscious of.

NW: It’s still hard to see how Abraham’s actions are admirable at all.

CC: For Kierkegaard, Abraham is a solitary figure who can’t be
understood, and can’t be admired, on the basis of any socially
acceptable notion of morality. Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice
Isaac doesn’t benefit any other human being: it doesn’t benefit Isaac,
of course, but there’s no benefit to anybody else either. It’s not that
he’s sacrificing Isaac for the sake of some greater social good.
Moreover, Isaac symbolizes society because he’s Abraham’s only
son and Isaac is the future tribe of Israel. Abraham is going to be the
father of a nation, and so that nation is symbolically, as Johannes de
Silentio puts it, contained in Isaac’s loins. So in sacrificing Isaac, he
is in fact sacrificing society as well.

NW: One of the difficult aspects of reading Kierkegaard is knowing what
Kierkegaard actually thought. What do you think Kierkegaard’ s message is
here?

CC: He wants the reader of the text to think for him- or herself, to
raise questions. Somewhere he writes that his texts are a mirror that
offers an aid to self-reflection, self-understanding, self-examination.
Just as the story of Abraham is open to endless interpretations, so
Fear and Trembling is also open to interpretation. My own
understanding of the book has changed over the years. Now I think
that Kierkegaard’s message is in the form of a question, and it’s the
question of whether the Christian ideal, the ideal of faith, is in fact
even attainable, whether it’s even possible. Could any of us really
have acted as Abraham acted? I think that’s the question he wants
readers to ask themselves. Then another question would follow from
this: if Abraham is the father of faith and if I could not have acted as
Abraham acted, then do I have faith, can I have faith, is it even
possible to have the kind of faith that Abraham demonstrates?

NW: Fear and Trembling appealed particularly to a number of existential
thinkers, notably Jean-Paul Sartre. What is it about the book that they
found so relevant to their interests?

CC: There are several aspects of the book. One is the way in which
it raises the question of the relationship between faith and reason,
and more broadly, the question of the relationship between human
existence, human subjectivity itself, and reason. A message that can
be taken from the book is that the truth of human existence can’t be
adequately grasped or expressed in terms of rational thought.

Another aspect is the theme of choice, of responding to a
particular situation, of being in an ethical dilemma—which several
of Kierkegaard’s heroes find themselves in—and not having any
grounds on which to make a choice between two alternatives.
Precisely because what Abraham does is irrational—in a sense he’s
left the sphere of reason—he’s faced with his own freedom, and that,
of course, is an experience of anguish which Kierkegaard
emphasises. Of course, the anguish of freedom is one of the central
themes of Sartre’s own existentialism.

NW: Why should anybody read Fear and Trembling today?

CC: If the reader is a Christian, then they’ll probably find some
kind of inspiration from reading the book. If the reader is a
philosopher, then they’ll find a challenge to their own faith perhaps
in philosophy. In this book, as in several of his other books, he’s
critical of academic philosophers who don’t necessarily reflect on
their own existence. They might ask abstract questions in order to
avoid reflecting on more pressing questions, as Kierkegaard would
see it, about what we are to do, what we are to commit to, and so on.

But Fear and Trembling is one of those books that doesn’t just
appeal to academic and religious readers. One of the reasons for this
is that it addresses themes that are universal human themes, such as
love, and suffering, and loss. At the centre of the book are a father
and a son: a father who’s faced with the prospect of losing his son
and generally of losing, or having to give up, what is most precious
to him. This is a human situation that we’re all likely to find
ourselves in at some point. So, the book has an emotional resonance
that is one of the reasons why it continues to be read and talked
about by a very wide range of readers.
