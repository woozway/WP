Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Back

JOHN CAMPBELL ON
George Berkeley’s Puzzle

David Edmonds:
    There was a young man who said God
    Must find it exceedingly odd,
    To think that the tree should continue to be,
    When there’s no one about in the quad.

    Dear Sir, your astonishment’s odd.
    I’m always about in the quad.
    And that’s why the tree will continue to be
    Since observed by
    Yours faithfully
    God.

This rather succinct summary of the philosophy of George Berkeley was
penned well after his death. Born in Ireland in 1685, Berkeley rose to
become a bishop. But his fame rests on his metaphysics. He was an
idealist, believing that reality consists only in minds and ideas, not in
objects and things. According to John Campbell, from the University of
California Berkeley, Berkeley’s philosophy must be understood against the
background of the seventeenth-century scientific revolution—a revolution
whose influence continues to be felt today—which, in some way, says
Professor Campbell, is most unfortunate …

Nigel Warburton: We’re going to focus on Berkeley’s puzzle. What was
Berkeley’s Puzzle?

John Campbell: Berkeley was working after Newton and Galileo,
after the impact of the seventeenth-century scientific revolution in
physics. If the physicists were right, if Newton was right, then the
world that we live in was not a bit like we think it is. Newtonians
were always pointing out that what the world consisted in was
mostly empty space, occasionally interspersed with lonely clumps of
atoms. The world we think we ordinarily encounter, the world of
colours and smells and tastes, the world of other people, the world
of tables and chairs—this world simply wasn’t there. This was just a
projection of the mind onto the alien universe that science describes.

In fact, things have deteriorated. The world as described by
quantum mechanics is unimaginably alien. Most of us operate with a
doublethink about this. Most of us just forget about it—and
physicists, too, mostly forget about it when they’re doing their
shopping or making dinner, or whatever. But, really, our official
view is that the world we actually live in is quite unlike the way our
experience seems to show it as being. So that raised a question for
Berkeley: ‘How do we form a conception of such a world in the first
place?’

NW: You’re saying that the physics of Berkeley’s time described the
world as consisting of lots of colourless molecule-like things. That’s what 
we would call them, but they were called ‘corpuscles’ in his day. Any
things such as colour, smell, taste were projected by the human observer
and weren’t really in the world out there.

JC: Before the scientific revolution, it was possible to hold on to a
common-sense picture where you encounter things the way they
really are. This new physics pushed conscious experience back
inside the head: it’s just something generated by the brain.

NW: So his puzzle is how we can say anything at all about the world
outside us?

JC: Yes, but Berkeley’s puzzle comes quite deep in the argument.
Because once you think that all that consciousness is, all that
perceptual experience is, is a bunch of sensations generated in us,
then we have the problem that it is on the basis of our conscious
experience that we form our conception of what the world is.
Berkeley quite rightly said that, if our starting point in forming our
beliefs, our opinions about how the world is, is just blobs of
sensation, then how can we so much as form the idea of an object
independent of us? If all I’ve got to go on is this wall of sensation,
how can I even frame the idea of something beyond that? His answer
was: ‘You can’t, it’s just an illusion.’ So, although science is the
starting point here, Berkeley says you kick away that ladder. Science
itself turns out not to have the significance you think it does because
all we can ever form the conception of is sensation itself. That is a
very radical idea but there is something rigorous about the logic
here.

NW: So where does that leave us on Berkeley’s picture of the world? How
do we relate to anything?

JC: It frankly leaves us in pretty bad shape. All we have are our
ideas. Berkeley was a theist, so he thought he could have knowledge
of God. But, of course, God simply has a bunch of ideas, too, and all
you can ever form a conception of, according to Berkeley, is families
of ideas. There is going to be structure in our sensations, there may
be similarities between your sensations and mine, but we ourselves
are not physical things. There is no coherent conception of matter;
there is only the generation of ideas by souls. That’s all you can form
a conception of.

At this point, most of us feel that something has gone wrong, and
you think, could we just go over the reasoning there and ask how we
got to this position: isn’t there a way out of here?

NW: So is there a way out?

JC: I think there is a way out, but you have to radically rethink the
natural picture of what science is telling us about our relation to the
world. For anyone who wants to hold on to the idea that there is a
physical world and consciousness too, you’ve got to say at some
point that science and talk about conscious experience describe the
same world but at different levels. People always say ‘at different
levels’—and then they do this chopping motion with their hand, and
then they say, ‘Well, different levels!’, as if that sorts it all out. But
although it doesn’t sort it all out, it must be the right starting point.

But once you have the idea that there are going to be different
levels in the description of reality, you could have played that card
right from the start. What I mean is, we usually take it that quantum
mechanics is telling us there’s nothing ‘out there’ but these basic
particles, these basic forces, the colours, and so on, are projected by
the mind. We didn’t need to accept that. We could have said the
colours are out there too, the smells and tastes are objective features
of the world, it’s just that they are describing the world at a different
level, the level at which science describes it.

NW: What about the obvious counterexamples there? An object looks
different colours under different lights; a stick might look bent in water.
The conclusion must be that there’s no absolutely right way of describing
the world independently of our perceptions of the world, mustn’t it?

JC: Well, if you just take the ‘looks bent in water’: whether the
stick is bent or not seems to be a perfectly objective fact. It may look
bent, but it’s not. I take it just as plain common sense. So, although
people can make mistakes about the way things are, or what colours
things have, and so on, they do have the colours. When you’re buying
a shirt, you might say, ‘Well, I know it looks yellow here but I just
want to check this.’ You take it for granted that things really have
colours, that things really have shapes. Of course, we make mistakes,
and sometimes they don’t look the shapes they are, and so on, but
that’s perfectly consistent with saying that there really is a fact of the
matter about all that.

NW: Where does that leave us with hallucinations, though, because if
somebody hallucinates something the relationship between the object and
the experience of it is certainly not a straightforward one?

JC: It’s certainly possible to have a hallucination that you can’t tell
apart from perception of, let us say, a dagger. Philosophers
sometimes seem to live in a world where these things are very
common, but in fact they are quite unusual. Now, if you can’t tell the
difference between one thing and another, then sometimes that is
because these two things are very similar. If you can’t tell the
difference between a real pearl and a cultured pearl, that may be
because, chemically, they are very similar. But it’s also possible that
you can’t tell the difference between one thing and another because
you’re just not very good at telling the difference between things of
those sort.

Now, with sensation or experience, on Berkeley’s picture, you
have the same sensation whether or not you’re having a
hallucination. The sensation is intrinsically the same whether you’re
seeing a dagger or having a hallucination of a dagger. That’s why you
can’t tell the difference between the two cases. I’m suggesting a
quite different analysis. On this analysis, when you are seeing a
dagger and when you are having a hallucination of a dagger, these
are intrinsically quite different states. It’s just that we’re not very
good at telling the difference between them. In the one state, there is
no dagger as a component of your experience. In the other case, an
actual dagger and its colour, texture, and so on really are involved.
These are very different states, and it’s possible that you’ll not be
able to tell the difference between them because of a limitation in
your discriminative capacities.

NW: So, you’re saying Berkeley’s starting point—that we couldn’t
separate the real qualities of the world from those which we project onto it
—was just a fallacy?

JC: That’s right. It’s something that’s still with us today. I think that
most educated people would take it for granted that colour is
projected onto the world by the mind. But I think that that notion
really is not well founded. All that science can tell you is that there
is a level of description of the world at which we don’t talk about
colour; the colour drops out. That does not show that colour is the
work of the mind. It just shows that we have to talk about different
levels here.

Brain scientists hunt assiduously through the brain looking at this
part of the neuron-firing or that part of the neuron-firing. They say,
‘Now, where exactly is the sensation of colour? Where exactly are
the sensations of the physical objects around us?’, and these are
nowhere to be found. That is very, very puzzling. People say, ‘Well,
maybe it’s very, very complicated, and we need sophisticated
mathematical analysis to find the sensation of colour’, but of course
there’s a natural suspicion that no matter how complicated the
mathematical analysis of the neuron-firing, there is still not going to
be a sensation of colour to be found. What I’m suggesting is that
that’s because we are looking in the wrong place. The colour is
where it seems to be, the colour is in the world, the colour is a
characteristic of our surroundings, not a characteristic of our brains,
and experience of colour is the relation that our brain puts us in to
this stuff.

NW: What you’re saying sounds like common sense. The objects are out
there, they’ve got qualities; I perceive them, they’re more or less as they
seem to be, and my conscious experience is simply a kind of mirroring of
what’s in front of me. Now, I know there are many philosophers who will
listen to this and say, ‘That’s naïve, there is a huge contribution that the
perceiving mind makes to our interpretation of objects—that is part of
what conscious experience must be.’

JC: You’re right. First of all, it is common sense, and there’s a
sense in which it is naïve. It’s trying to reinstate the picture of our
relation to our surroundings that we could have had before the
impact of science. What I disagree with is the idea that our brain
makes a big contribution to our picture of the way the world is. We
shouldn’t think of it like that. If you think of it from an evolutionary
point of view, the reason you have a brain is not to generate a whole
bunch of sensations that have nothing to do with what’s actually
going on. Why would you want such a thing? The picture I’m
suggesting is that all the stuff that we common-sensically take to be
out there, really is out there, and the function of all the brain
processing is just to make it visible to us. That does take a lot of
brain processing, it’s very important that we have brains. But their
function is to reveal the world to us, not to generate a lot of random
junk.

The scientific revolution seemed to take away the idea that there’s
a world that we all have in common, a world that we share.
Because, after all, what’s going on is that the world that’s in common
is this world of alien forces. All that is happening within me and
within you is generating sensations in you, is generating sensations in
me, and for all we know, they are completely different sensations.
So, the scientific revolution really shut us off from each other. It gave
us the present problem of other minds; it said, we shall never know
what is going on in one another’s minds. Now, if you reinstate the
common-sense world, if you say the colours and so on are all there,
that it’s just a high-level description of the same world that science
describes but is there independently of us, then what’s happening in
your experience is that you are encountering the very same
qualitative world that I am encountering. So there isn’t a problem
about whether your experience is qualitatively the same as mine.
Because it’s the same qualitative world that we’re all encountering.
