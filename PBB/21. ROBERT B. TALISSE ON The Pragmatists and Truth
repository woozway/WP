Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Back

ROBERT B. TALISSE ON
The Pragmatists and Truth

David Edmonds: Baseball may be popular in America, but the sport
hasn’t really taken hold in many other countries in the world. Its
philosophical equivalent is Pragmatism: it’s sometimes called ‘American
Pragmatism’ because its three major figures, Charles Peirce, William
James, and John Dewey were all Americans, writing in the late nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries. Pragmatism is described as a movement,
which masks the fact that its leading figures had major philosophical
differences. Opponents of Pragmatism say it’s dangerous in all its forms.
It’s a type, they say, of pernicious relativism. For some objective truth
about Pragmatism we turned to a leading authority on the subject: Robert
Talisse of Vanderbilt University.

Nigel Warburton: Pragmatism in philosophy is different from the way the
word ‘pragmatism’ is used in everyday life. Could you outline what it is?
What is this movement known as Pragmatism?

Robert Talisse: Pragmatism begins at the turn of the twentieth
century, primarily with the writings of Charles Sanders Peirce,
William James, and then John Dewey. It began with Peirce as a
conception of the meanings of terms and statements. The claim is that
the meaning of a sentence such as ‘this knife is sharp’ is to be
understood in terms of the kinds of actions one would perform with
the object. So, ‘this knife is sharp’ means, for the Pragmatist, ‘if you
rub it up against many other substances, it will cut’. The idea is that
the meaning of sentences is to be brought down to a description of a
kind of experiment—if you perform a certain kind of action you will
get this sort of effect.

NW: Just to get that straight, most people would say that what it is for a
knife to be sharp is that it cuts things. But Pragmatism isn’t just common-
sensical, is it? It’s actually a philosophical reaction against a different
way of conceiving what a word like ‘sharp’ could mean.

RT: That’s right. It’s an attempt to functionalize all of our
philosophical concepts rather than an attempt to make them more
lofty or abstract or, for example, to talk about the property of
sharpness. So you can imagine a Platonist, a follower of Plato,
saying ‘“x is sharp” means that it manifests or partakes in the form of
“the sharp”’. The Pragmatist wants to say in response, ‘That’s not the
right kind of analysis. It’s not that the Platonist gives the wrong
theory of properties, it’s instead that the Platonist is barking up the
wrong tree.’ To say that something is sharp is to say that if you
perform certain actions with it, you will get certain types of results.
So, the idea is to bring everything down to what’s practical and to
avoid abstract theorizing and appeals to transcendental properties.

NW: But Pragmatists don’t just focus on whether or not knives are sharp.
What sort of topics interest Pragmatists?

RT: The effort is to bring philosophical analysis more in line with
scientific practice. Pragmatists offer this conception of meaning as a
way of dismissing, or removing from the philosophical agenda,
certain kinds of philosophical problems which had been puzzling
philosophers for thousands of years: questions about properties, and
essences, and substances and these highfalutin abstract concepts. The
Pragmatists’ objective is not to give answers to the question of what
substance is, or what essence is, but to dismiss such questions
entirely, to say that these are the wrong questions to ask. So, there’s
an agenda that has as much to do with answering the question of what
philosophy can do as it has to do with trying to give philosophical
theories. The Pragmatists’ thought is, ‘once you start talking about
things that aren’t verifiable, or that couldn’t be brought down to
some real difference in human experience, you’re philosophically off
on the wrong track’.

NW: It sounds as if Pragmatism is close to what’s called Logical
Positivism—the idea that a statement is meaningless if it’s not empirically
verifiable (if it can’t be tested) or if it’s not true by definition.

RT: That’s right. The earliest Pragmatist, Charles Peirce,
sometimes writes in a way that brings him very close to the
verificationism of Logical Positivism that prevailed in the first half
of the twentieth century. But Pragmatism is different from Logical
Positivism. The difference between the Pragmatists and the Logical
Positivists comes up most starkly in the work of William James who
sees a problem in Peirce’s statement of Pragmatism. James thinks
that, for example, Peirce’s Pragmatism is insufficiently sensitive to
matters of value. It seems from some of Peirce’s writings that value
drops out of the Pragmatist picture because you couldn’t do a test in
a laboratory to find out whether something is good or beautiful.
Peirce was angered by James to some considerable extent—in fact,
Peirce eventually declares that he’s no longer a Pragmatist, and
renames his view ‘Pragmaticism’. Peirce says he wants to
distinguish his view by giving it a name that is ‘ugly enough to be
safe from kidnappers’; he sees William James as one of the
kidnappers.

James sees this positivistic element in Peirce’s Pragmatism, and
so offers an alternative version of Pragmatism. In response to the
verificationist element of Peirce’s Pragmatism, James says, ‘Well,
we mean by “experience” something much broader than philosophers
typically mean.’ So, James thinks that the meaning of a sentence is
the implications in experience for somebody who believes that
sentence to be true. To put the contrast starkly, Peirce thought that the
meaning of a statement consists in the empirical consequences of its
being true; while James held that the meaning of a statement consists
in the empirical consequences of its being believed to be true. In this
way, James would say questions about religion, about God, about
value, about beauty are all very deeply meaningful. They’re not
dismissible because you can’t do a laboratory experiment to verify
their truth. Instead, you have to ask yourself, ‘What would it be to
believe that?’; and James thinks that if believing in God gives you
the right kind of psychological comportment towards the world so
that you can get on with your life and not be depressed, that’s all the
justification one needs to adopt the belief. And, more importantly,
those enabling psychological effects are part of the meaning of the
belief.

NW: I can see how that then makes sense of James’ famous book The
Varieties of Religious Experience as part of a Pragmatist project, but it
also raises a problem for Pragmatism, which is that a lot of people believe
that either God exists or doesn’t exist as a metaphysical entity. The truth is
outside of the human in some sense: the truth is the way the world is.

RT: That’s right. This is a particularly difficult problem for
William James. James says famously, ‘Truth is what works.’ He
holds that the truth of a proposition is equivalent to how successfully
it guides action. So, it looks as if James is saying that if you believe
that the bus leaves at 8 a.m., and that belief guides your actions in
such a way that you actually get on the bus, that’s what it is for the
belief to be true. But, as you say, what gets left out is the conception
that the truth of the sentence has something to do with how it maps
onto, or corresponds to, or hooks up with the world.

Having said that, James has some pretty interesting arguments to
suggest that the conception of correspondence or ‘hooking up’ with
the world is philosophically muddled. James is very keen to say,
‘Look, it’s unclear what the metaphors of “correspondence” or
“hooking up with”, or “latching on to reality” mean; how can we
cash those out philosophically?’ He thinks that standard
correspondence views of truth trade largely in metaphors that never
get fleshed out. So, he asks how could a sentence—a string of
sounds, or scratches on paper—bear that kind of relation
—‘correspondence’—to tables and chairs, dogs and cats, and
things?

NW: But religious people believe that God exists. They don’t think that
God is just a convenient idea that makes their lives go better.

RT: That’s right. I think that you’re right to point out that there might
be a bait and switch in James’ defence of religious belief. He’s
saying to religious believers, ‘Religious belief is philosophically
above board and you shouldn’t be brow-beaten out of it by clever
philosophers.’ But then, when you look at what he gives as the
analysis of the content of religious belief, it’s a psychologized
version of religion. For James, belief in God means hope for the
improvement of the universe. Belief in God means, having what
James calls ‘the strenuous mood’, the psychological comportment to
the world that will enable you to fight for its improvement, and fight
for what you see as good; religious belief for James has nothing to
do with the afterlife, or angels and folks with long beards and white
hair up in the sky.

Let’s bring this down to a particular example. James gives an
analysis of transubstantiation, the part in the Catholic mass where the
wine and bread are transformed by the priest, so the doctrine goes,
into the actual blood and body of Jesus. Charles Peirce thought that
transubstantiation was ‘meaningless gibberish’; for him, it was just a
metaphysical doctrine that should be dismissed as nonsense. James,
however, says, ‘No, the idea that we could actually feed on the body
and blood of God is psychologically potent. It is truly the pragmatic
application of the idea of substance.’ He says that the doctrine of
transubstantiation is psychologically useful in helping us to sustain
our motivation for improving the world. Now, whether that’s going
to move any religious believer or not is of course a different
question.

NW: It seems to me that Pragmatism ought to have quite a lot to say
about science. Is that historically true?

RT: Yes, that is true, and in fact we get the explicit focus on science
and philosophy of science most heavily in the work of John Dewey.
For Dewey, the theory of inquiry—the theory of actual
experimentation, hypothesis-testing, and production, and all the rest
—was a central occupation. One thing to say about Dewey’s view of
science is that it shares some of the motivations of the Logical
Positivist but tries to work with a broader conception of science.
The idea is that experimentation is the heart of science. The activity
of manipulating, checking for results in light of that manipulation,
going back and revising hypotheses—this ongoing process of a
sophisticated version of trial and error—is what Dewey means by
science.

Dewey thinks that scientific experimentation as it’s practised in
the laboratory is just a refined or more systematic version of
ordinary human thinking generally when it’s done properly. So, the
thought is not the Positivist one that science is a special kind of
practice, and we now need to model philosophy on it. The Deweyan
Pragmatist thought is that all thinking manifests in some very general
way the pattern of inquiry that gets practised in a more systematic
way in the laboratory. We need to take note of this fact and revise
our philosophical concepts in light of the experimental methods of
science.

NW: It seems to me that the Pragmatists could almost dispense with the
notion of truth once they’ve started cashing it out in terms of behaviour
and belief and so on.

RT: That’s right, at least for many versions of Pragmatism. Dewey
is pretty explicit about this. He argues that we could replace the
concept of truth with the concept of warranted assertability or
warranted assertion; he thinks that scientific inquiry is really after
warrant or justification for hypothesis, rather than truth. For Dewey,
truth talk is going to fall out, warrant talk is going to come in, and
warrant is always going to be contextual, historical, or sociological.

NW: Pragmatism didn’t stop at the turn of the century: it’s had an
afterlife. In my lifetime, the one philosopher who stands out as having
been heavily influenced by Pragmatism is Richard Rorty. How is he a
Pragmatist? What did he do with the tradition?

RT: Well, Rorty, I think, is the inheritor of Deweyan Pragmatism.
And, just to pick up on what we were just saying about replacing the
concept of truth with warrant—which on Dewey’s view is always
contextualized and historical—Rorty takes that view a step further
and says things like this: ‘Truth is just a pat on the back that we give
to sentences which seem to be paying their way.’ Or elsewhere he
says: ‘Truth is simply what the people you’re speaking with will let
you get away with saying; Truth is just what your conversation
partners will all nod “Yes” to when you say it.’ And, further, Rorty
claims that there’s nothing more to say about truth. So he has an
eliminativist view of truth. It’s not that truth is too hard, or that
there’s no good theory of truth. Even looking for a theory of truth is a
mistake for Rorty. Truth is the kind of thing we should not take to be
a philosophical matter at all.

NW: Now, I know Rorty had this thrown at him, but what about the
Nazis? What the Nazis did was backed by many millions of people in
Germany, Austria, and parts of Poland. And yet now we look at it as the
most horrific thing ever done. Is it all relative? That can’t be right, can it?

RT: Well, I agree with you. I’m not a Rortyan Pragmatist; in fact,
I’m an anti-Rortyan Pragmatist. And you’re right this is the standard
line against Rorty, and I think it’s a powerful line. Rorty’s response,
though, is very interesting, and disturbing. His response is to say that
there’s nothing that you can really do to show that the Nazis or anti-
liberals like Nietzsche are wrong. All you can do is say they’re not
part of the community of conversationalists that I like to get on with.
Like all Pragmatists, he’s got this second-order view about what
philosophy can achieve. Rorty wants to say that the whole point of
philosophy, the whole point of Pragmatist philosophy as Rorty
understands it, is to encourage us, as he says, to stand unflinchingly
for our commitments even once we’ve realized that there’s no
philosophical justification that can be given for them. He says that
all philosophical justifications of liberal democracy are circular:
they’re all just restatements of what people like us liberal democrats
say about freedom or about violence. When we criticize the Nazis,
we’re really just addressing the audience of people who are just like
us—fellow liberal democrats. He says it’s an error, encouraged by
traditional philosophy, to say that if we can’t give an argument that
even Hitler would have to be moved by, well, then, liberal
democracy is somehow enfeebled or jeopardized. Ultimately, Rorty
would have to say that Nazism and western liberal democracy are
the same: neither enjoys any greater philosophical justification than
the other. And, yes, that’s relativism. But Rorty says that there’s no
alternative to relativism, so there’s nothing to the charge that a view
is relativist; one can criticize a view for being relativist only if one
accepts that it’s possible for a view to be non-relativist, which is
something that Rorty denies. He claims that all views are relativist;
the only difference between them is that some are self-aware of their
relativism, and others are deluded about it.

NW: That seems to be a theme in twentieth-century philosophy. We had
the Logical Positivists such as A.J. Ayer saying that moral judgements are
just expressions of emotion, they’re purely subjective. Then there are the
existentialists embracing something not dissimilar to what you’ve
described in Rorty: this idea that there’s a contingency about human
values, but you have to stand up for the values that you yourself endorse.
And we have the later Pragmatists as well. Three sorts of philosophical
movements pushing in that direction. Interesting, but disturbing, too …

RT: Very much so. Rorty, as you have described him, is even taking
A. J. Ayer one step further. Rorty’s not saying that moral judgements
are only expressions of emotion or merely the expression of
emotion. He’d object to the ‘only’ and ‘merely’ in those statements,
because, according to him, there’s no alternative. Remember that the
Logical Positivists think science gives us the model of objectivity.
They hold that, since moral statements can’t fit into that model, moral
statements are non-objective. Rorty wants to say that what Ayer
thought was the case with respect to moral statements is also the
case with respect to scientific statements. There’s no objectivity to
be had; there’s just, as he says, solidarity: making community with
the people who are like you, and saying things to each other that you
all endorse as a way of feeling community with others. And that’s all
there is. And that’s all philosophy can do, on the Rortyan view.

NW: We’ve travelled quite a long distance here talking about the key
Pragmatist thinkers running right through into the late twentieth century.
Yet, despite it being a practical philosophy, there does seem to be
something missing. Pragmatism misses that sense of awe and wonder that
is the start of philosophy, the idea that we are trying to explore a reality
that’s beyond us.

RT: I think you’re right that there is a sense of something missing to
the philosophical enterprise in all the Pragmatists’ views. I think
that’s deliberate. Pragmatists adopt something like the view of the
later Wittgenstein that traditional philosophy is a kind of
dysfunctional urge or a symptom of something wrong. Wittgenstein
held that we need therapy to get over certain kinds of philosophical
longings, and philosophy traditionally had been a way of trying to
pursue those sickly aspirations. Pragmatism often sees itself as a
way of trying to cure us of those aspirations.

Now we can ask: Who is right? Is traditional philosophy right to
hold that there’s something essential to the human condition that
requires us to ask these deep questions; or is Pragmatism right that
the deepest traditional philosophical questions—the questions that
bothered Plato, Aristotle, St Thomas Aquinas, Descartes, and all the
way up through Kant—are somehow misguided or have set us off on
the wrong path? That is itself a deep philosophical question, of
course. But you’re right; that’s what’s being offered by the
Pragmatists: a rejection of the traditional philosophical concerns.
Pragmatism is not simply a philosophy that doesn’t get at these
deeper things; it is an explicit rejection of the thought that we should
pursue traditional philosophical aspirations.
