Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Back

TERENCE IRWIN ON Aristotle’s Ethics

David Edmonds: Aristotle was a Renaissance man who lived almost two
millennia before the Renaissance. He wrote on many, many subjects:
politics, rhetoric, biology, logic, music, poetry, and much more. But none
of his works attracts more interest than those on ethics. Terence Irwin has
spent most of his career at Cornell University, and is now Professor of
Ancient Philosophy at Oxford.

Nigel W arburton: The topic we’re focusing on is Aristotle's ethics. Tell us
a bit about who Aristotle was.

Terence Irwin: A bare outline of Aristotle’s life is this: He was
born in 384 BC; he was the son of a doctor. He was a Macedonian,
and hence, from the point of view of the Athenians, he was barely a
Greek. He spent 20 years as a member of Plato’s Academy, and then
he left Athens after Plato’s death in 347 BC. He travelled around the
eastern Aegean, and, among other things, he engaged in natural
history. He returned to Athens in 338 BC and set up his own
philosophical school, the Lyceum. He organized an extensive
programme of research, not only in philosophy, as we think of it
now, but also in biology and in constitutional history, chronology,
and many other things. He died in 322 BC, just a year after the death
of Alexander the Great, whom Aristotle is supposed to have taught.

NW: One of the things he taught at the Lyceum was ethics is how to live.
What was his general approach to that question ‘how should we live?’?

TI: Maybe we could begin with the word. Aristotle was probably
the first person to call this subject êthika, and that means, literally,
the study of character. For Aristotle, this is part of political science.
It’s the most general aspect of political science in that it tries to
discover the ultimate good for a human being. Aristotle argues that
among the things we need in order to achieve that good is virtues of
character. So that’s why the work’s called ‘on character’, or êthika.
And these virtues involve the appropriate development and ordering
of emotions and non-rational impulses.

These virtues of character are of two kinds. The first kind are
self-regarding, concerned with one’s own good. For instance,
bravery involves the appropriate way of directing fear and
confidence; temperance involves the appropriate direction of
physical impulses. The second kind are other-regarding virtues.
These concern one’s own good in so far as it includes the good of
others. Aristotle argues that since we have a social nature, our good
includes friendship with other individuals, and more generally it
includes links with the social and political community.

NW: He believed that if we cultivate these virtues appropriately we will
flourish as human beings. He has a lot to say about flourishing and about
what it is to be human. He also thought that there was such a thing as
human nature which gave rise to this flourishing.

TI: Yes, maybe I can begin with human nature. Aristotle takes
human nature to include both the physical and the mental, both the
non-rational and the rational aspects of a person in so far as he or
she is formed or permeated with or guided by rational thought. For
Aristotle, the fulfilment of human nature involves the organization of
the rational and non-rational aspects of human beings, so that they
fulfil human capacities as a whole. That fulfilment is the condition
that Aristotle describes as the human good, which he also calls
eudaimonia. ‘Eudaimonia’ is usually translated into English by
‘happiness’, or, less appropriately, by ‘flourishing’. ‘Flourishing’ is
something that trees can do: but trees can’t manage to be eudaimon
according to Aristotle; only rational agents can do that.

So eudaimonia is like happiness, as we ordinarily understand it,
in that it includes mental elements: pleasure, sense of well-being,
satisfaction. But it’s not confined to these mental elements. It
requires pleasure and satisfaction in the activities that are
appropriate for a rational agent. So, that’s the way in which
eudaimonia is similar to and dissimilar from what you might think of
as happiness.

NW: The virtues that give rise to eudaimonia have to be exercised
according to the Doctrine of the Mean. What is the Doctrine of the Mean?

TI: Its importance may have been exaggerated. Some people
understand it as advice to aim at moderation in all things: that phrase
is a mistranslation of a sentence of St Paul’s, and it’s also a
misinterpretation of Aristotle. Aristotle means that virtue of
character doesn’t consist simply in expressing the impulses that one
might acquire from nature or upbringing. On the other hand, it is not
simply an ascetic suppression of these impulses. It’s something
between the extremes of ‘letting it all hang out’ and repressing
everything. In that respect, it’s in the middle, an intermediate, or
mean condition. This mean is the appropriate harmony of non-
rational and rational impulses under the guidance of practical
reason.

Take bravery as an illustration: the brave person doesn’t try to
suppress fear altogether. The brave person is the one who is afraid
in the right conditions and for the right reasons, but not on the
occasions when it would be interfering with acting appropriately. So
that’s how the general claim about the mean applies to this particular
virtue.

NW: Aristotle has been tremendously influential both in his own time and
subsequently. Could you outline some of the ways in which his influence
has been felt?

TI: Perhaps I could mention two special periods of revival or
renewal of Aristotle in ethics. The first can be dated roughly from
the thirteenth to the seventeenth century, the so-called period of
scholasticism. Contrary to the associations of the name, this is an
extremely creative development and systematic working out of
Aristotelian ethics by Christian philosophers and theologians: the
period runs roughly from Aquinas in the middle of the thirteenth
century to Francisco Suárez at the beginning of the seventeenth
century.

The second period of renewal is in the nineteenth century, and the
main figures are Hegel and Marx, and the British Hegelians
especially, T. H. Green and F. H. Bradley. They looked to Aristotle
to overcome some of the false assumptions, as they saw it, that were
shared by moralists in the empiricist and rationalist traditions: Hume
on the empiricist side and Kant on the rationalist side. Similarly,
they looked to Aristotle to overcome the false political assumptions
that they attributed to both conservative and liberal political theories
of the eighteenth century.

NW: Aristotle didn’t just influence philosophers in these two periods:
he’s continuing to influence philosophers now.

TI: Yes, and I can give a couple of examples of that. First, moral
philosophers have shown renewed interest in the study of character
and the virtues; these are the aspects of morality that involve being a
certain way or living a certain kind of life rather than simply acting
in certain ways. Second, some political philosophers have
developed a communitarian critique of liberal political theory which
clearly goes back to Hegel’s critique of liberalism, but beyond that
back to Aristotle.

NW: Could you just expand on that? What is a communitarian approach,
and how is it Aristotelian?

TI: According to a liberal view, one ought to think of a state as a
way of achieving and protecting the interests of individuals. A
communitarian view goes back to Aristotle’s claim that human
beings are social and political in nature. According to this view, the
appropriate aim of the state is to achieve the human good, and hence
to design institutions and to train people so as to cultivate the kinds
of virtues that Aristotle talks about. This view might have definite
social and political consequences that would not follow from a
liberal view. So, that’s a debate in contemporary political theory that
clearly has its inspiration in Aristotle.

NW: Y ou’ve devoted a lot of time to studying Aristotle’s ethics: what did
he get right in this area, and which aspects would you like to jettison?

TI: The description of his position that I’ve been giving is meant to
be sympathetic. I don’t want to jettison him, but to correct him on
certain points. Maybe I could pick two things. The most obvious is
that Aristotle thinks only a few human beings are naturally equipped
to achieve the sort of life that he takes to be the best life. W e know
enough about human beings and the social influences on them to
know that he’s wrong about that. So we need to understand Aristotle,
to put it briefly, from an egalitarian point of view, and that’s where
Karl Marx’s appropriation of Aristotle is especially important.

The second point is this. Aristotle thinks of practical reasoning in
general, and moral reasoning in particular, as being ultimately
concerned with one’s own good or the good of the community in
which one finds one’s own good. He should have recognized that
that’s not all there is to practical reasoning. He should have
recognized that people also have duties and rights that are distinct
from those goods. To put it in technical terms, we need
deontological as well as teleological practical reason; or, to put it
in historical terms, we need Kant as well as Aristotle.

NW: What does it mean in practice to say that we need Kant as well as
Aristotle?

TI: There are some things that we owe to people that we don’t owe
to them because that will make us better off or them better off or
society as a whole better off. If, for instance, people are owed a
certain degree of freedom of expression, if that’s a right that they
have, that’s not something you need to justify by reference to
anyone’s good. That’s a point you won’t find in Aristotle; it’s a point
that Kant emphasises. That’s what I mean by saying that one
important aspect of morality is missing from Aristotle.

NW: I could imagine somebody reading this, thinking that’s all very
interesting historically, but does a philosopher like Aristotle have any
contemporary relevance? Why should I study Aristotle? What light does he
shed on contemporary moral issues?

TI: Moral philosophy has a practical point, but it doesn’t
necessarily tell you what to do here and now, or whom to vote for
here and now. Those are questions sometimes for moral casuistry
and sometimes for political thinking. But moral philosophy can
provide principles that might guide us in formulating the right
practical questions or help us evaluate acts or institutions or the
design of a society. The provision of those sorts of principles is its
practical point. Shall I say something about the questions to which
those sorts of principles would be relevant?

NW: Y es please.

TI: Let me pick two questions that are connected with things I’ve
been talking about. First question: what’s education for and what
should it include? For instance, should people merely be taught
skills that will help them to function in the economy: is that all there
is to education? Or should they learn to live a good life? Can they be
taught to live a good life, and can they be taught to live it without
indoctrination? Aristotle stands pretty strongly on the interventionist
side of this debate. He thinks that learning to live a good life is
something that can be taught and that it’s an appropriate function for
the state to undertake.

Second question: what is the right way to think about morality? In
particular, should we try to train people to limit their pursuit of their
own interest and to take account of other people?

Another way of putting this: should we learn to think of our own
interest so that we recognize that we also pursue it in so far as we
are also concerned for the good of others? That’s a familiar way for
people to think about their own interest in relation to others when
they’re thinking about members of their families or close friends. But
is it sensible to think of this identification of one’s own interest with
other people’s interest in relation to a much larger group of people,
people you don’t know? The Aristotelian answer to that question is
certainly ‘yes’: the model of identification of interest and friendship
extends to the larger group of people. If that’s correct, it’s a
challenging way to look at morality and would affect the way that we
think about such things as duties, self-sacrifice, and concern for
others.

NW: So according to Aristotle pursuing your own interest benefits other
people?

TI: It would be clearer to reverse that direction and say that in
pursuing the interest of others you pursue your own interest, and
that’s why there’s no conflict. That’s not too hard to understand in the
case of a parent doing something for their child. If you said, ‘you’re
doing something for someone else (your child) and that’s bad for
you’, the parent might say, ‘That’s ridiculous. What’s good for the
child is good for me too.’ There’s no conflict of interest in that case.

Aristotle’s insight, or perhaps Aristotle’s wishful thinking, is the
claim that this pattern also explains other cases of concern for the
interests of others. It fits not just relations between parent and child,
or relations between friends, but also relations between fellow
citizens, and even relations to people you don’t know. Whether that’s
wishful thinking or an insight is a significant question about how we
think about morality.
