Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Back

A. C. GRAYLING ON
René Descartes’ Cogito

David Edmonds: It’s arguably the most famous phrase in philosophy:
‘Cogito ergo sum’. And its author, René Descartes, is often described as the
founder of modern philosophy. Descartes was born in France, but ceased
both to think and to exist in Sweden where his death was probably due to
pneumonia (the Swedish queen Christina made him get up at five a.m. to
tutor her). Here, to discuss Descartes’ famous phrase, is A. C. Grayling,
author of a recent biography of Descartes.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we’re focusing on is Descartes’ Cogito.
Before we get on to that, could you tell us a little about who Descartes
was, and the times in which he lived.

A. C. Grayling: René Descartes is a significant figure in the history
of modern philosophy and, indeed, in the history of modern thought
in general. He was born in 1596; he died in 1650: so he lived in the
first half of the seventeenth century, which was an important time for
the development of the natural sciences and for what—owing largely
to Descartes himself—was a revolution in philosophy. He also lived
through a period of great tumult in Europe: the Thirty Years’ War.
This was fundamentally a war of religion, an attempt by the Catholic
Habsburg dynasty to reclaim Europe from the Protestant states for
the Catholic cause.

He was educated by Jesuits to whom he was loyal all his life. He
was, I think, a sincere Catholic—certainly he didn’t ever do anything
that would get him into trouble with the Catholic Church. His great
contribution is to have cut through all the jargon, technicality, and
over-elaboration of Scholastic philosophy—which was philosophy
that had become encrusted with all sorts of intellectual barnacles
during and since the medieval period—and to refocus attention on a
central question: What do we know and how can we know it with
certainty? This question was especially important at the beginning of
the scientific revolution, the period in which Descartes lived.

NW: And he was a scientist, as well, wasn’t he?

ACG: He was a scientist and a mathematician. His contributions to
mathematics are significant. We all know about Cartesian
coordinates because we suffered from them at school: he came up
with the idea while lying in bed watching a fly walking on the
ceiling, and realizing that he could give you the location of that fly
anywhere on the ceiling by using the edges of the walls as
coordinates, and providing an X and Y axis reading.

NW: But with his philosophy, epistemology, the theory of knowledge, was
central. He wanted to know whether there was any belief he could be
certain was true.

ACG: Yes. Descartes says, in what is perhaps his most famous
philosophical work, the Meditations on First Philosophy, that you
have to begin by asking yourself the question: ‘What can I know with
certainty?’ He tackles this question in the first and second of the six
meditations, and does it in a very interesting way. He says, ‘All the
sceptical arguments that have been put forward in the past are
insufficiently strong to enable me to set aside everything I thought I
knew—to set aside everything that admits of the least taint of doubt.
Neither scepticism about the senses nor the possibility that I’m
dreaming are swingeing enough to allow me to do this. But suppose I
hypothesize that there is an evil demon whose whole purpose in
existence is to fool me about everything. If there were such a demon,
is there anything it cannot fool me about? If there is, that is what I
can be certain of.’ And, according to Descartes, there is indeed one
thing that you cannot be fooled about.

NW: Before we get to that one thing, we should say a little bit about
Cartesian Doubt: what was it?

ACG: Descartes wasn’t a sceptic; he uses sceptical doubt as a tool,
an instrument for arriving at the point of certainty required as the
bedrock for his inquiry. So he uses some of the traditional sceptical
arguments: scepticism about the validity of what we learn through
the senses; the possibility that we might be dreaming; or, most
generally of all, the possibility that we are systematically deluded by
everything we can be deluded about, by this evil demon, to set aside
even our most assured beliefs, even our most foundational beliefs. If
any belief admits of the least tincture of doubt, however absurd, that
is the excuse he uses temporarily to set it aside in order to see
what’s left, what point of certainty remains.

NW: So, I’m sitting here in front of you, I can’t doubt that, can I?

ACG: Well, yes, you can. You might be asleep and be having a nightmare
that you’re sitting here in front me, and that would be a reason for calling into
question the truth of the proposition, ‘I’m sitting here in front of you now.’

NW: What argument does he use to get out of this scepticism?

ACG: He says, the one thing I couldn’t be fooled about even if
there were an evil demon who was trying to fool me about
everything, is that I exist. Or, to put it in the famous formulation that
everybody knows (everybody also knows ‘I drink therefore I am’ on
pub walls), he says, ‘I’m thinking. That’s something about which I
simply cannot be in doubt, and I can’t be thinking unless I exist. So, I
exist.’ This is the bedrock, the point of certainty. This, in the
philosophical tradition is known as the Cogito. Cogito ergo sum: ‘I
think, therefore I am.’

NW: So why does Descartes feel so certain that he exists? Surely he
could be dreaming that he exists?

ACG: Even if he’s dreaming, he exists: he has to exist in order to
dream. He has to exist to do anything: to work, to be in doubt, to be
fooled by a demon. All these things are themselves proofs, in the
moment, of the fact that he exists.

NW: Some philosophers have pointed out that all the argument actually
shows is that there are thoughts now. To say that ‘I’ exist implies
something further than could be actually worked out from that argument.

ACG: That is an interesting point and it was one to which
Descartes was alert. Immediately after the Cogito, immediately after
saying, ‘The one thing I can’t doubt is that I exist’, he goes on to ask,
‘What then am I? What is this thing that exists?’ This, of course, is
the root of the mind–body problem because he says, ‘What I am is a
thinking thing, and I might doubt that I have a body, I might doubt that
there is an external physical word, but I can’t doubt that there is this
thinking thing that I am, and therefore that’s what I am.’

NW: And how does Descartes get beyond the simple Cogito argument?
Because the Cogito itself is only going to give him a thinking thing: the
conclusion that there’s one thinking thing in the universe.

ACG: Yes. This is where Descartes makes a key step, and this is to
say, ‘Right, so I know I exist. I’ve got all these beliefs about an
external world, and what I need is a way of getting from what I think
to that external world in a way that guarantees that my beliefs about
it have a chance of being true. So I need a sort of magic ingredient X,
the X-Factor, which will serve as a guarantor of the validity of my
taking the beliefs in my mind to be true of something outside my
mind.’

What would do such a thing? Well, if there is a good God—not
merely a God but a good one who, because He is good, doesn’t want
to fool us—He doesn’t want to give us intellectual equipment and
five senses and then mislead us—then my beliefs about an external
world have a chance of being true if I use my faculties responsibly.
That, indeed, is the strategy Descartes adopts: he produces two
arguments for the existence of God, and having got his God and a
good God, he can be satisfied that there is a world and that most of
his beliefs about it are true.

NW: So one way of characterizing what Descartes does is to see the
whole sweep of The Meditations as a U-shaped turn: at the very bottom is
the Cogito, which is what he called his Archimedean point. Until that point,
he’s descending into scepticism. Then, from that point, he turns around,
introduces God, and it’s uphill all the way, and he’s back almost to the
point from where he started.

ACG: That’s a good description, yes. And he’s using the first-
person pronoun, talking about his experience of sitting down and
trying to think about the structure on which his knowledge is based;
and by this first-person device gets the reader to follow and be
persuaded by him by in effect being the ‘I’ of the meditations: ‘I
doubt this, but then I see that I must exist, and then I see that I have in
my mind an idea of a perfect being. If there is such a being then I
wouldn’t be what I am and have the faculties that I do unless I had
the chance of knowing the truth about the world’ … and so on.

So that story allows the reader of the Meditations to follow that
path through doubt, down to the bedrock, which is the Cogito, and
then on to a reconstitution of everything that he previously thought he
knew.

NW: How do you judge the argument of the Cogito; is it a good
argument?

ACG: It’s not even clear that it’s an argument. Its status is a
controversial matter. If it were an argument, it would have to have a
major premise. It would be what’s called an enthymematic
syllogism, with one of its premises assumed and therefore not
expressed. The Cogito says, ‘I think therefore I exist.’ So that looks
as though it’s missing a major premise stating, ‘Everything that thinks
exists.’ But, of course, at the level of scepticism which Descartes
has reached at that point, this premise is not available to him.

His critics said that it can’t be a syllogism—so what is it?
Descartes never came up with a satisfying answer. Subsequent
philosophers have examined the possibility that it’s some kind of
performative utterance, as when you arrive at a party and say, ‘I’m
here!’ which of course is true whenever you say it, but you’ve said it
for the purpose of attracting attention on that occasion. Others have
suggested that the Cogito is a ‘presuppositional’—existing is a
presupposition of anything else, including of course being able to
think that one exists, so all Descartes is doing is pointing out a
necessary condition of the truth of ‘I think’.

Others have tried to argue that the Cogito is a logically
degenerate statement, again of the form ‘it’s now’ or ‘I’m here’ or ‘I
exist’. All these statements are self-verifying and therefore empty,
just as ‘I do not exist’ or ‘I’m not here’ or ‘it is not now’ are self-
refuting.

So there’s controversy about the nature of the argument. But
whatever one can say about its logical status, it remains undeniably
true when anyone says it of himself or herself.

NW: Is it fair to say that contemporary philosophers see the virtues of
the downward slope of this argument up to the point of the Cogito and are
fairly dismissive of the sorts of arguments he uses to build up from the
other side?

ACG: Yes, that’s right. If you look at the history of epistemology
since Descartes, the majority opinion, especially on the empiricists’
side, is that scepticism shows us that we’ve got a job of work to do:
we’ve got to get from the private data of consciousness to an
external world. Now, how are we going to do that if we can’t buy
Descartes’ story about a good deity? If you dispense with that as
your security for getting from experience to the world, what’s going
to take its place? If you consider Locke, Berkeley, Hume, Mill,
Russell, Price, and Ayer, major figures in the debate about
epistemology, they all in their way focus on that question.

What’s so interesting is what happened in the twentieth century in
response to this issue, which was to say: ‘Since we can’t get from
Descartes’ starting point to an external world with any great security,
perhaps we should recognize that it’s the starting point which is at
fault’—and that would be the greatest criticism of Descartes.

NW: Having said that, the Meditations is superb as literature: this is a
wonderfully clear piece of writing.

ACG: This is one of the two significant things about Descartes’
position in the history of philosophy. First, he identified the right
question to be asking—what can we know and how?—right there in
the early seventeenth century with the rise of modern science,
junking all debate about how many angels can dance on the head of a
pin, and cutting right to the chase.

Second, because he wasn’t relying on jargon, on the apparatus that
scholastic philosophy had generated, he was able to write in a way
that was accessible to everybody. It’s a piece of writing which is
marvellously clear and lucid and accessible.

NW: What do you think there is of value now for us in Descartes’
Meditations?

ACG: Apart from the pedagogical value—it’s a book which is
wonderful for beginning students because of its clarity and
accessibility—it focuses a question in epistemology which has to be
centre stage when you’re thinking about the nature of knowledge and
how we get it. We may disagree with Descartes that the right place to
start is with the private data of consciousness—if you look at
Dewey, Wittgenstein, Heidegger, and others in the twentieth century,
you see that all of them repudiate that Cartesian starting point. They
all say: ‘Don’t start with private experience, start with the public
world or public language. Anyway, start somewhere else because
you will never be able to escape the mind otherwise.’

Nonetheless, Descartes’ endeavour—to start from experience and
get to a world—is a salutary one in the sense that if it’s wrong, it’s
powerfully, interestingly, and importantly wrong, and it teaches us a
great lesson. I don’t think you can do epistemology in philosophy in
a serious way unless you’ve engaged with Descartes, and thought
through his way of thinking about these things.
