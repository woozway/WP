Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Back

JOHN DUNN ON
John Locke on Toleration

David Edmonds: The late seventeenth-century philosopher John Locke is
often described as the first of the British empiricists—all knowledge, he
thought, came through experience. Locke made seminal contributions in
many areas—in metaphysics, epistemology, and personal identity. He also
wrote prolifically about politics and the justification for the state. Some of
his most significant writings were produced in Holland: he’d been forced
to flee into exile in 1683 after rumour of his involvement in a plot to
assassinate King Charles II. This was a time when Europe was riven by
religious conflict between Catholics and Protestants. Not surprisingly,
Locke became preoccupied with the issue of religious toleration—the
subject of this interview. Professor John Dunn is a John Locke scholar.

Nigel Warburton: We’re going to focus on John Locke’s ideas about
toleration. Could you first say something about who Locke was?

John Dunn: Locke was an Oxford don in seventeenth-century
England who escaped from Oxford into politics and into
cosmopolitan intellectual life and ended up writing some very
important books.

NW: He wrote several hugely influential letters on toleration.

JD: Yes, that’s right. He wrote about toleration over the whole of
his intellectual life: it was his most consistent preoccupation. But he
didn’t publish anything until his late 50s, when he published three
books in the same year: one, a great philosophical treatise, the Essay
Concerning Human Understanding; the second, a very surreptitious
book, the Two Treatises of Government; the third which
chronologically was published first—and in Latin originally—was
what we now call the Letter on Toleration.

NW: What motivated Locke to write this Letter on Toleration?

JD: The basis for demanding religious toleration and the scope
over which it should extend were major intellectual interests of his
throughout his life. But what moved him to write the Letter on
Toleration while he was in exile in Holland in the 1680s was the
overwhelming impact on European Protestantism of the revocation
of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 by the French monarch Louis XIV .
This was a more or less formal end to a period of effective practical
toleration of Protestantism in France, admittedly on very grudging
terms, and a prelude to all-out religious persecution. Locke was
trying to defend the rights of European Protestants to practise their
own religious beliefs.

NW: So, for Locke, toleration is specifically religious toleration?

JD: Yes, that’s very important. The Letter on Toleration is a
defence of freedom of conscience. In practice, what freedom of
conscience meant was freedom of worship. It didn’t unequivocally
mean freedom of thought, and it didn’t unequivocally mean freedom
of speech, which are the two categories that most people think of
today when they are thinking of toleration. He very specifically
meant the freedom to worship God as you judge that God requires
you to do.

NW: That did not include freedom not to believe in God?

JD: No, it certainly did not, and for very deep reasons from
Locke’s point of view. Of course, the primary reason was that Locke
believed that there was a God, and that that God had some
distinctive properties. What was most striking, and certainly
perturbs people who read the Letter on Toleration today, is that
Locke assumes that to fail to believe in God, to believe that there is
no God, is a very serious practical danger to the lives of other human
beings.

NW: Why is that?

JD: The fundamental reason is because Locke believed that it was
only in so far as you recognize the threat of punishment in an
afterlife, and to a rather lesser extent the promise of rewards in the
afterlife, that you had sufficient reason to act in the way that you
should.

NW: So you might not keep your promises if you didn’t believe in God?

JD: He thought that you might do anything you felt like if you didn’t
believe in God, and that you might be quite reasonable in so doing.
Unless you believed in the threats and promises of an afterlife, you
couldn’t reliably have good reason to behave as he thought you
should.

NW: What sort of arguments did Locke use to defend his idea that his
contemporaries should have freedom of conscience?

JD: The very simple argument he used was this: the most important
interest that human beings have is discharging the duties that God
assigns to them. It’s the degree to which they succeed in doing that,
that generates their prospects in the afterlife. The afterlife, ex
hypothesi, is a setting in which you can guarantee that you will be
over-punished or over-rewarded in relation to any rewards or
punishments you might incur here in your natural life. So if you had a
thrillingly gratifying but religiously deplorable life here, because of
the afterlife, you could guarantee that that was a grievous practical
error. If you had a thoroughly miserable but impressively devout life,
you could guarantee that that would turn out tremendously well in the
long run.

NW: All this rests on Locke’s basic premise then that there is such a God.
If there is a God, then the risks of doing something that God did not want
you to do are huge.

JD: Yes, Locke thought that it was appropriate to forbid people to
be atheists and to punish atheists very seriously, giving as his reason
that the taking away of God, even only in thought, ‘dissolveth all’.
So, there goes freedom of thought. 

NW: That’s interesting—because many of Locke’s contemporaries would
have used a belief in God as their justification for persecuting people of
other faiths.

JD: Yes. The big intellectual challenge that Locke faced in the
Letter on Toleration was to refute the view that religious
persecution was a religious duty. The most important intellectual
innovation from Locke’s own point of view was the construction of a
rather rich theory of why that judgement was mistaken.

NW: Could you give a flavour of that theory?

JD: The key point about the theory was a distinction between the
basis of membership on the part of a human being in two different
sorts of society: first, a political society; second, a church or
ecclesiastical society. The view that religious persecution was a
religious duty incumbent on a political sovereign required the
conflation of those two: it required identifying church and state.
Locke very specifically distinguished the two conceptually. The
basis of membership in a church had to be a sincere and personal
choice and belief, whereas the basis of membership in a state,
although at some point in the causal history of the state in question it
had to pass through deliberate choice, couldn’t, at any particular
point in time, be simply a matter of personal choice because that
would destroy the structure of the state. There couldn’t be continuing
political authority if it could be dissolved whenever anyone
dissented from its requirements.

NW: So, Locke separated the state from religious belief. How does he
deal with the problem of the clash of different religions within a society?

JD: The key step he makes is to remove from the state the
possibility of its being the embodiment and judge of religious truth.
He imposes on the state a particular duty—the duty to preserve the
terrestrial rights of all its subjects. All citizens have a right to their
own religious beliefs and they have the right to act on their own
religious beliefs in so far as their action doesn’t conflict with the
civil rights of any of their fellow subjects. But no one has a right to
act in a way which conflicts with the rights of any of their fellow
subjects or citizens, and the role of the political sovereign is to
monitor their interaction and ensure that interference in one another’s
rights is prevented or punished if it occurs.

NW: He also had a pragmatic argument about why we shouldn’t
persecute some people for their beliefs.

JD: He had a lot of arguments of different kinds about why
religious persecution was a bad idea; he totted these arguments up,
because religious persecution was in full swing at the time and he
was eager to apply the brakes as drastically as he could. One idea
was that religious persecution is futile because you can’t alter
people’s beliefs by threatening them. Of course, that is a very strong
argument if you’re thinking about the impact of a threat at the moment
at which you level the threat. I’ve never met anyone who can alter
their beliefs merely because they are threatened. But the fact is that if
you keep the threat up for two or three generations, you can have
quite a dramatic effect on the content of people’s beliefs.

He also has another sort of argument directed especially to
Christians, which was that religious persecution was an intrinsically
corrupting process spiritually for the persecutors. Some of his most
eloquent writing was about that process of corruption. It wasn’t
really a formal argument, but it was an attempt to demonstrate
imaginatively to members of his audience that many of their more
self-righteous convictions clashed with other self-righteous
convictions that they also held, and to encourage them to edit these
self-righteous convictions so that they came out in a more reflective
and imaginatively stable form.

NW: Does the separation of church and state begin with Locke?

JD: No, it doesn’t begin with Locke. A lot of dissident Christian
movements had argued for the desirability of this at different points
beforehand. But Locke provided the most sophisticated and coherent
theoretical account of it from inside Christianity, and no one has
surpassed his account since.

NW: We obviously live in an age where religious toleration is a live issue
again: is there anything we can take from Locke for our present-day
situation?

JD: W e can’t take a practical recipe from Locke because it isn’t a
practical recipe. W e can’t take a very cheery and comforting
message from him, either. But we can take from him a structure for
thinking about the issue of personal freedom. The key distinction in
Locke’s theoretical account of the scope of religious toleration was
the distinction between theoretical beliefs and practical beliefs. The
reason why any interpretation of the requirements of Christianity,
which did not itself entrench on the rights of other fellow citizens,
was entitled to toleration, while atheism was not so entitled, was
that, provided they didn’t entrench on other people’s practical rights,
interpretations of the requirements of Christianity are purely
theoretical beliefs. But because of his distinctive view about the
structuring of reasons for action, atheism was a practical belief,
because atheism is the belief that there’s no reason why you
shouldn’t do whatever you’re reasonably confident you can get away
with, and of course that is an incredibly subversive belief.

There’s religious belief about what to do in relation to God in
order to save your own soul, which he saw as the central and most
important content of religious belief. Then, there are concomitant
inspirations about what you can permissibly do to one another. What
we may do to one another falls within the space for which the
political sovereign is responsible; it’s within the space of human
worldly interaction, and it’s not protected by religious inspiration.
So, if I have the religious inspiration that I should now kill you,
however sincere and authentic and motivating my inspiration may
seem and feel to me, that isn’t a matter of religious toleration; that’s
a matter of civic threat. On the other hand, supposing I believed that
God was a very large green cheese, even if that was a pretty silly
belief, it would be completely unjustifiable for you to do anything
unpleasant to me apart from possibly sneer a bit because I held that
belief, since I am entitled in that area to hold whatever inane beliefs
I happen to hold. What I’m not entitled to do is to act practically in
the world against anyone else’s interest because of religious beliefs I
happen to hold.
