Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Back

A.W. MOORE ON
Immanuel Kant’s Metaphysics

David Edmonds: As the citizens of Königsberg in the late eighteenth
century watched the professor of logic and metaphysics go for his regular
daily walk at precisely the same time each day, they must have wondered
what he was thinking about. Well, one of Immanuel Kant’s preoccupations
was whether we could work out things about the world without experience
—without, as it were, leaving the armchair—and substantial truths, not
just what Kant called analytic truths, in other words, not just truths of
definition like ‘all bachelors are unmarried men’. This apparently arcane
issue is at the heart of Kant’s investigation of the limits of human
knowledge in his Critique of Pure Reason. Professor A. W. Moore dispenses
a wealth of knowledge from his armchair in St Hugh’s College, Oxford.

Nigel Warburton: We’re going to try to explain Kant’s metaphysics today!
Could you start by addressing the question, ‘What is metaphysics?’

A.W. Moore: Metaphysics can be usefully characterized as the most
general attempt to make sense of things, the attempt to understand
what the basic structure of reality is like.

NW: So, it’s at the heart of philosophy—a drive to understand our
relationship to our experience and to the world.

AWM: Absolutely, it’s the core part of philosophy. Other branches
of philosophy all depend on metaphysics in various ways. You could
say that it’s the part of philosophy that holds the rest of the discipline
together.

NW: Immanuel Kant is most famous for his Critique of Pure Reason, and
that’s the work we’re focusing on today. It’s an incredibly complex,
difficult book, but it has a central theme: could you summarize that theme?

AWM: Yes, it’s an extraordinarily complicated book, and it’s
difficult to summarize. Kant is fundamentally concerned with
metaphysics in two senses. First of all, he’s trying to do metaphysics
in this book. He’s trying to tell us something about the broad
structure of reality, trying to make sense of things at the highest level
of generality. But also, he’s very interested in stepping up a level and
raising questions about metaphysics, about its nature, its scope, and
its limits—because one of the things that he was struck by when he
looked at the work of his predecessors, stretching back over
centuries, was that there hadn’t been much in the way of consensus,
not only about metaphysical issues themselves, but about how much
was even possible within metaphysics.

His immediate predecessors had notably disagreed about what
was possible within metaphysics. If we accept the standard cartoon
sketch whereby his immediate predecessors divided into
Rationalists and Empiricists, then we can say that, according to the
Rationalists, it was possible by a pure exercise of reason to arrive at
substantive conclusions about the nature of reality, whereas the
Empiricists were altogether more sceptical. The Empiricists thought
that reason was much more limited than the Rationalists took it to be
and that the only way that we could arrive at substantive conclusions
about the nature of reality was to do the sort of thing that we do in
the natural sciences, which is to appeal to experience. So Kant was
very interested in this fundamental disagreement between the
Rationalists and the Empiricists, and, in a way, tried to act as
referee.

NW: One of the things he did in his role as referee was to come up with
the notion of the synthetic a priori, which is fundamental to understanding
the Critique of Pure Reason.

AWM: Absolutely. Let’s think of this in terms of that dispute
between the Rationalists and the Empiricists. Kant was inclined to
agree with the Rationalists that it was possible to use pure reason to
arrive at substantive conclusions about the nature of reality. He was
inclined to agree with the Empiricists that it was impossible to
arrive at substantive conclusions about what was completely
independent of us, without using experience. And part of what he
wanted to do with this notion of the synthetic a priori was to
reconcile these.

NW: So, the first part of the synthetic a priori is the word 'synthetic',
and that’s contrasted with ‘analytic’.

AWM: Yes. Kant draws a distinction between what he calls
synthetic knowledge and analytic knowledge. Analytic knowledge is
knowledge that’s available to us just by pure exercise of our
concepts. By reflecting on the nature of our concepts, we can arrive
at certain basic trivial truths about what things are like. We know, for
example, that all sisters are female, not because we have gone out
and investigated sisters to find out whether they fit the bill or not, but
simply because it’s part of our concept of a sister, that a sister should
be female. So the truth, which it is, that all sisters are female would
count as an analytic truth for Kant. That contrasts with, for example,
the truth that some sisters are younger than their own siblings’
children, which again is a truth, but which depends on the way things
actually are. It’s not written into the concepts involved, and to
ascertain that that’s true you do need to go out and investigate.

NW: So analytic truths are true by definition, and synthetic truths are the
kind which you require some kind of research to find out whether or not
they actually are true?

AWM: That’s right, yes.

NW: Now, how does another distinction, between the a priori and the a
posteriori, differ from that?

AWM: On the face of it, they look just the same. The standard way
of characterizing a priori knowledge is as knowledge which is
available without appeal to experience. A posteriori knowledge, or
empirical knowledge, as it’s also sometimes called, is knowledge
which is grounded in experience. And it can easily look as if these
are just two ways of drawing the same distinction. The two very
examples that we considered earlier of analytic knowledge and
synthetic knowledge would also serve as examples of a priori
knowledge and empirical knowledge.

It’s a priori that all sisters are female. You can tell that all sisters
are female without appeal to experience. By contrast, although it’s
true that some sisters are younger than their own siblings’ children,
it’s not something that can be ascertained without consulting
experience. We actually have to investigate sisters to find out
whether any sister satisfies that condition. It turns out that there are
indeed some sisters who are younger than their own siblings’
children.

Nevertheless, although, on the face of it, it looks as if we’ve got
two ways of drawing one and the same distinction, Kant is adamant
that these two contrasts come apart from each other. In particular, he
believes that there is some knowledge which, on the one hand, is a
priori and yet, on the other hand, is synthetic.

NW: So, could you give an example of a synthetic a priori truth?

AWM: Many of Kant’s own examples are mathematical. Probably
the most famous of all is that 7 + 5 = 12. This for Kant counts as a
priori. It is something that you can tell just by an exercise of reason.
You can do mathematics in your armchair. You don’t need to go out
and get your hands dirty and investigate what the world is like. So
your knowledge that 7 + 5 = 12 is an example of a priori knowledge
rather than empirical knowledge. But, Kant says, mathematical
methodology doesn’t consist in simply reflecting on the nature of
your concepts either. No matter how carefully you analyse your
concepts, that’s never going to be enough to give you the insight that
7 + 5 = 12. You have to appeal to something else.

The arithmetical example is not necessarily the most convincing
as far as that’s concerned, but he did also often cite geometrical
examples where it seems a bit more plausible. One of his favourite
examples was that between two points you can only have one
straight line. Again, he would have insisted that this was a priori, but
not analytic. (Subsequent developments in physics have shown that
this example is problematical in ways that Kant couldn’t possibly
have known, but let’s ignore that.) However closely you investigate
your concept of straightness and your concept of a point, and the
various other concepts involved, that is never going to give you
insight into this truth, Kant says. You have to consider the nature of
space itself.

NW: So we’ve got this puzzle. There are things which I can know sitting
in my armchair without observing anything. I can think about things and
discover truths about the nature of reality, not just about things which are
true by definition. So, if Kant’s right, he’s got a real puzzle on his hands.
How is it that we can discover things about the world without leaving the
armchair? How does he solve that puzzle?

AWM: He solves it in the following way. He says that what we’re
really uncomfortable with is the idea that there should be knowledge
about what’s out there independent of us, which we can nevertheless
arrive at by pure reflection. And Kant agrees that such a thing is
impossible. So his solution to the puzzle is to deny that the synthetic
a priori knowledge that he’s talking about is knowledge of what is
out there independent of us. Although this knowledge doesn’t consist
in pure reflection on our own concepts, it does nevertheless consist
in pure reflection on our own intellectual apparatus.

The metaphor that’s often used in this connection, a very helpful
metaphor, is that of a pair of spectacles. It’s as if we have innate
spectacles through which we look at reality. When we arrive at
synthetic a priori knowledge of things, we’re reflecting on the nature
of our own spectacles. It’s synthetic, because those spectacles
themselves involve more than just concepts. We’re not reflecting on
the nature of our own concepts, but we are reflecting on the nature of
our own spectacles. In particular, as the geometrical example might
have led us to expect, Kant believes that these spectacles include
space and time themselves. Even space and time are an aspect of
how we view reality, rather than an aspect of reality itself.

NW: So, for Kant, reality is not really accessible to us. What is
accessible is the perceptual apparatus that we are endowed with, which is
like a pair of spectacles. If these spectacles have a rose tint, everything we
perceive necessarily has a rose tint. Space and time are like the colours
that we take to be out there because of our perceptual apparatus rather
than something independent of us.

AWM: Exactly, you’ve just expressed it very well, Nigel. Kant
believed that we can know that between any two points there’s only
one straight line because that’s part of the intellectual apparatus that
we carry around with us and that we impose onto reality when we’re
trying to make sense of it, when we’re trying to come to know what
reality is like. This is something that we can not only know but can
know a priori; we don’t need to go out and investigate whether space
is like that, because it’s part of our own intellectual equipment.

NW: So does that mean that we can’t really know how the world is, that
all we can know is how we perceive it?

AWM: That’s exactly what it means. And here we come back to the
issue that we began with, the issue of where Kant stands in relation
to metaphysics. What he does in the Critique of Pure Reason is to
follow through two separate projects: a positive project and a
negative project.

In the positive project, he does as much within metaphysics as he
feels can be done, spelling out how things must appear to us through
our spectacles. He believes that there is a whole range of interesting
and substantive conclusions that can be drawn about that, about how
things must appear to us through our spectacles. But, as you just
emphasised, ‘appear’ is the operative word. He’s drawing a
fundamental distinction between how things appear to us and how
they are in themselves.

The fact that we carry these native spectacles around with us
means that there must be such a distinction. We can never take these
spectacles off. We only have access to how things appear to us. How
things are in themselves is something that we can’t know, and that is
the thing that Kant wants to emphasise in the negative project, which
also occupies a substantial part of the Critique.

It does mean, unfortunately, that a lot of the traditional questions
of metaphysics have to be put to one side as just unanswerable. That
includes questions about, for example, the Deity: whether there’s a
God or not; and, if there is, what the nature of God is. It also
includes questions about our own freedom, whether we have free
will or not, because Kant thinks that, in so far as such a question
arises, it’s a question about how we are in ourselves rather than
about how we appear to ourselves.

NW: So, what Kant’s doing is setting the limits of what we can know in
the process of telling us what we can know.

AWM: That’s exactly right, and he’s concerned with both. He’s
concerned with what lies within the limits, and he’s concerned with
what lies beyond the limits—and he’s concerned with making sure
that we draw the limits in the right place.

NW: It might seem to follow that, because we can’t know about it, any
discussion of reality, including whether there’s a God or free will, is
completely meaningless. Is that how Kant sees it?

AWM: That’s an excellent question, Nigel, and it’s very important
to emphasise that that’s not how Kant sees it. That is how other
metaphysicians have seen it. Arguably, that’s how his great
predecessor, David Hume, saw it, at least to an extent. But that’s not
Kant’s way of regarding the matter. Kant is adamant that these
questions are perfectly meaningful: there is a reality out there. The
fact that we have spectacles through which we view things doesn’t
detract from the fact that there are things being viewed.

There is a reality out there. There is a way it is, irrespective of
whether we can know what it’s like or not. The point is simply that
we can’t know what that reality is like in itself. But we’re at liberty
to speculate and, as far as the great religious questions are
concerned, we’re at liberty to have faith that things are a certain
way. So, it is an article of faith that some people have that there is a
God. Kant is far from wanting to deny people that article of faith. He
thinks that what they believe, when they believe that there’s a God,
makes perfectly good sense. They may be right, they may be wrong,
but certainly it makes perfectly good sense. All he’s doing is telling
them that they can’t have knowledge of whether what they believe is
true or not.

NW: Now, the First Critique is a massive tome, incredibly complex in its
arguments, and you’ve done a brilliant job of pulling out the main threads
of the book, but it’s such a complex work that it must have been an intense
labour to put it together. What do you think was motivating Kant in writing
that book?

AWM: I think the answer to that question relates directly to the
thing that we were most recently talking about. There’s one very
revealing sentence in the preface that he wrote to the second edition
of the Critique of Pure Reason where he said: ‘I had to deny
knowledge in order to make room for faith.’ It seems to me that one
of the things that was really motivating Kant was this desire to
safeguard articles of faith.

But perhaps of even more fundamental concern to him was
something that I touched on very briefly: the idea that our own
freedom is also a matter of how things are in themselves rather than
how they appear to us through the spectacles—because one thing that
Kant was really concerned to do was to safeguard our belief in our
own freedom and all that goes hand in hand with that belief, in
particular the importance to us of morality (traditional Christian
morality, as Kant saw it), which doesn’t make sense unless we’re
free agents.

Kant was keen to safeguard all of that against the threatening
pretensions of the natural sciences, which at the time that he was
writing really were threatening. Science had made astonishing
progress in the preceding century. In particular, Newton’s work had
seemed to show that almost everything, if not everything, could be
accounted for in purely scientific terms. It looked as if the world
was a place where everything was governed by inexorable
mechanical laws. That in turn looked as if it posed a very serious
threat to our belief in our own freedom and everything that goes hand
in hand with that.

What Kant was able to do with this elaborate system that he had
constructed was to show that we could both accept science in all its
glory and cling fast to our belief in our own freedom by going back
to this distinction that he drew between how things appear to us
through the spectacles and how they are in themselves. Science is
concerned with how things appear to us through the spectacles;
science is concerned with the world of space and time, the world of
nature. We can accept that, when viewed through the spectacles,
everything is subject to inexorable causal laws, while at the same
time accepting that we, as we are in ourselves, are free agents
subject to the demands of morality.

NW: So, for Kant, the unknowable is genuinely unknowable, but it’s still
protected. He’s protecting things like the possibility of free will and the
possibility of God’s existence, even though we can’t be absolutely sure
about either of those things.

AWM: That’s absolutely right, Nigel, yes.

NW: Given the way you’ve discussed Kant’s work, it’s clear you’ve got a
great appreciation of him as a philosopher. How would you rank him
amongst philosophers?

AWM: My own view is that he’s probably the greatest of all.
