Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Back

MELISSA LANE ON
Jean-Jacques Rousseau on Modern Society

David Edmonds: Karl Marx saw the industrial revolution and its
injustices as an inevitable stage on the way to a communist utopia. But,
before Marx, there had been another searing critic of so-called ‘progress’.
Jean-Jacques Rousseau was an intellectual celebrity: a philosopher,
novelist, musicologist, educationalist, polemicist, and author of arguably
history’s most influential autobiography—his Confessions. He was born in
Geneva in 1712, and died in 1778. The industrial revolution was still to
come, but his Parisian friends—who mostly became ex-friends—were
joyful participants in the advances in arts and sciences. Rousseau,
however, railed against modern society and the idea of progress in the arts
and sciences; he warned against the cities, and their ‘black vapours’; he
eulogized nature. Melissa Lane is a historian of ideas and political
theorist at Princeton University …

Nigel Warburton: We’re going to focus on Rousseau and his critique of
modern society. Could you say a little bit about who Rousseau was?

Melissa Lane: Yes. Jean-Jacques Rousseau was a citizen of Geneva
in Switzerland in the eighteenth century. In later life, he would make
much of that because part of his critique of modern society was a
critique of the French, where he made his career. He celebrated and
idealized the purer republican values of Geneva. Rousseau led a
very interesting itinerant life as a secretary in households of the
great, such as the French ambassador to Venice. At the same time, he
led a less reputable life, fathering five children out of wedlock with
a mistress. In the younger and middle parts of his life, he was a
friend and companion to the men of the Encyclopaedia. The
enormous Encyclopédie project was celebrating all of the advances
of the arts and sciences. Diderot and Voltaire were two of the great
names associated with it.

NW: Before we get on to his critique, what were the ideals of the
Enlightenment?

ML: Well, certain strands of the Enlightenment celebrated advances
in arts and sciences and in particular the development of what we’ve
come to call commercial society. Commercial society was driven by
people’s wants as well as by their needs. The celebration of
commercial society grew out of a critique of republican politics that
depended on a notion of people being virtuous and self-controlled
and limiting their desires in order to maintain their civic dedication.
In the commercial society, it was said, we can be more prosperous
and more peaceful, if we trade with each other; the private vices of
people consuming luxuries can bring society together in a new way.
It will have peace and order and growth built on trade and
interaction.

NW: Rousseau was part of this movement—at what point did he turn
against it?

ML: There was a particular moment. In 1749, he was on his way to
Vincennes in France to visit Diderot, who was imprisoned there for
violating the censorship. And he spotted the subject of a prized essay
that had been set by the Académie of Dijon. The subject was whether
the restoration of the arts and sciences had contributed to the
improvement of mankind. Later in the Confessions, his
autobiography, he said that at that moment, he was visited by a kind
of illumination which led him to say ‘no’. And all of his critique of
modern society flows from that moment.

NW: What kind of societies were the French philosophers contrasting
their notion of modern society with?

ML: The context was the coming to grips with the discovery of the
new world: America and then Australia. This confronted Europeans
with a question about the status of the peoples there. The Scottish
Enlightenment thinkers would develop a four-stage theory of history:
people start at the primitive stage; then comes a hunting stage, then a
pastoral or agricultural stage, and finally the stage of commercial
society. This was seen as a form of progress: for example, Adam
Smith and David Hume both write that, if we contrast a king among
the Indians in North America with a peasant or a worker in Scotland,
we see that the peasant or worker is better off—and that’s due to the
progress of civilization. Hume was Rousseau’s contemporary and
erstwhile friend until Rousseau believed that he had turned against
him.

NW: So what was it that Rousseau objected to about modern society?

ML: He expresses his illumination in his First Discourse published
in 1750 on the sciences and the arts. He says our psychology and our
morals have been corrupted by this progress of social development
and it’s made us unhappy and estranged us from ourselves. He
develops a kind of speculative anthropology to describe what man
was like in a state of nature and how human sentiments and emotions
then developed. His view was that this progress of social
development brings with it a kind of dependence on the opinion of
others: modern society is all about the need for pride and esteem that
has to come from others.

He draws a contrast between amour de soi, self-preservation
sentiment, self-love in the benign sense of just trying to keep myself
alive with what he calls amour-propre. Amour-propre is my self-
esteem, my vanity, my sense of how others see me.

In civilization, we become entirely driven by our amourpropre.
This is always leading us to be in a competition with others and we
can never be truly satisfied. The terrible paradox of civilization for
Rousseau was that we’re in a society of plenty and yet we are less
happy than when we wandered naked in the glades of some barbaric
past. Our desires start to outstrip what we can do for ourselves and
we become completely dependent on other people and how they
view us. We become locked into a kind of rat race of competitive
esteem-seeking which none of us can ever win; we’re all going to be
miserable.

It was crucial for Rousseau that the king or the aristocrat in this
order was as miserable as the peasant: in fact you’re even worse off
to the extent that you’re even more dependent on other people’s
esteem.

This is the genesis of the psychology of the master–slave dialectic
in Hegel, of the critique of bourgeois civilization in Marx, and on to
Freud. All of this has one key origin—in Rousseau.

NW: For Hobbes, life outside society is pretty grim—with driven egoists
competing for scarce resources. Is that how Rousseau sees what’s called
the state of nature?

ML: Not at all. This was a point on which Rousseau fundamentally
challenged Hobbes, although in other ways his politics was greatly
indebted to Hobbes. In the true state of nature, Rousseau had an
image of people as being very solitary creatures who wander around
peacefully and only occasionally meet for sexual congress. They’re
independent and self-sufficient.

NW: Do you think to some extent this is a reflection of Rousseau’s own
desire to be alone?

ML: Well, that’s a very interesting thought. Rousseau didn’t think
the scrabbling-for-acorns stage was actually a stage that we should,
in itself, idolize, because he sees that many of our best human
capacities also develop gradually and through interaction. So he had
a notion of perfectibility that wasn’t entirely negative. But he thought
that we could try to arrest social development at the level of the
village or the hut, where we’ve graduated to the stage of family. In
this stage, we have true familial affection, and not just occasional
meetings for sex, and we have a very limited social life. But we’re
still living in a kind of primitive agricultural way: we’re yeomen
tilling the soil, and our desires and our competitive instincts haven’t
been fully awakened yet. In that stage, we achieve the same kind of
self-sufficiency that we had in the acorn-grubbing stage. To come on
to your point about his own personal desire for isolation, in his
Reveries of a Solitary W alker, one of his very last works, he
describes an affair that he had and the kind of perfect mutual
understanding that he shared ‘as like being alone’. So I think he
wanted society to be like being alone.

NW: One of the things that modern society gives us is ways in which
people can learn about the past, and be educated by other people’s
mistakes and successes.

ML: Education is a key issue for Rousseau: he tried to address that
point by designing another form of education that could give us
certain advantages of social life and culture, but without the fatal
disadvantages that he thought education in the arts and sciences in his
day would bring. He describes in Emile, published in 1762, the
imaginary education of a boy by a single tutor. The boy is educated
very carefully to only develop such intellectual capacities and such
psychological desires that he will be able to fulfil. So, for example,
if something goes wrong in his life, he should be taught to ascribe
that to nature or fate so that he won’t resent it—instead of thinking
that he was being thwarted by some other individual, which might
lead him to be sucked into a kind of psycho-drama with this other
person that will then disrupt his own psychological peace. People
said about Kant that when Rousseau’s Emile arrived, it was the one
time he didn’t take his everyday walk that the villagers in
Königsberg set their watches by. Kant was so overwhelmed and
excited by this book.

NW: And in this book nature plays a big role; it’s not just the tutor who
teaches the child, the countryside teaches him as well.

ML: That’s right, and that was another aspect of Rousseau’s
critique of modern society. The counterpart to advanced society is
the ability to escape into nature; nature plays several roles for
Rousseau. One is the role of fate which we have to come to accept.
Another, especially in Rousseau’s own later life in the Reveries, is
the role of a refuge: we can lose our self, for example, in botanizing,
we can find mental peace. This had a great impact on Rousseau’s
contemporaries. Rousseau’s books were huge bestsellers across
Europe, and many people tried to recreate his ideals in a natural and
pastoral society: including, for example, Marie Antoinette who was
famous for her deep immersion in the corrupt life of the court. She
went to a little village outside Paris.

NW: Quite a surprising aspect of Emile is that Rousseau is an early
advocate of breast-feeding.

ML: Yes, that’s right. He thinks that breast-feeding is a natural way
to nourish the child and to nourish the bond between mother and
child. Rousseau’s views on women and their role are significant. On
the one hand, he idealizes women as mothers and thinks that they
play a crucial role in educating children to have the sentiments of
affection and of patriotism that a good society can spring from. At
the same time, he thinks that for them to do that, they mustn’t
themselves be too rational, or play too much of a public role. So it’s
in one way quite an exulting role for women, but in another, a
confining one. And Mary W ollstonecraft, one of the great feminist
thinkers who lived just a little bit later than Rousseau, would
excoriate him for this.

NW: We’ve talked about Rousseau’s prize essay. His Discourse on
Inequality continues some of these themes.

ML: Yes. ‘The Second Discourse’, as it’s known, was published in
1755. It develops these themes even further into their political and
economic significance and implications. In particular, what
Rousseau comes to see as responsible for the worst turning points in
that degeneration/development of human society is the institution of
property. At the moment of the hut, there is property, but it’s really
just the use of land. For Rousseau, it’s the ability to then start to
monopolize property that leads to the division of society into the rich
and the poor. In this picture, not everyone is equally treated in the
development of society: we now have these two antagonistic groups,
and Rousseau thinks that from that point on, it’s not just
psychological unhappiness that we have to contend with, but
political oppression. He comes to see the origin of political power
in society as a kind of bargain between the rich and the poor. He
asks, why would the poor agree to uphold property, why should the
poor not be storming the Bastille and storming the estates of the
nobles? And he says, well, the rich persuade them that in order to
hold on to the little that they have, they should accept the laws which
then benefit the rich so much disproportionately more.

NW: This is a pretty radical critique, isn’t it?

ML: It is radical and, indeed, I think that that aspect of the critique
of bourgeoisie civilization and its effects on the poor profoundly
anticipates Marx. We can get the real social criticism of the
bourgeoisie as much from Rousseau as from Marx and expressed
even more powerfully. Marx thought that bourgeois society was
playing a crucial role, a historical role, a necessary role: it was
providing the accumulation that would eventually lead us through to
communism. For Rousseau, there’s nothing good about it. My teacher
Judith Shklar, a great Rousseau scholar, used to say that Rousseau is
society seen from the bottom up; he shows us how society looks from
the standpoint of the oppressed. This is again a turning point in
western social and political thought.

NW: Do you think there are things that we could learn now from
Rousseau’s thought?

ML: Rousseau really challenges us to ask the fundamental question,
Is commercial society making us happy? And in an age when
commercial society and its externalization of costs has produced
ecological crisis, these are very profound questions that Rousseau
presses on us. How sustainable is the cycle of desires and wants that
commercial society seems to require? Criticisms of the ad industry,
for example, could have been written by Rousseau, in terms of the
way that they continually awaken these desires for competition and
status and self-advertisement in ways that can never be fully
satisfied: we always need one more product, and Rousseau would
have been able to prophesize that all too well.

NW: Like some classical philosophers, Rousseau didn’t just write about
ideas, he actually tried to live them.

ML: He did. And the Confessions is a profoundly significant
document in the history of western thought for that reason. He makes
his own life a kind of example of a uniquely pure and virtuous heart
which has somehow been outraged and exploited and abandoned and
betrayed by his contemporaries, by these Enlightenment
philosophers, each one of whom he quarrels with and abandons. At a
certain point in his life, he leaves Paris and goes to live in the
countryside, turning his back on the fleshpots of Paris. This was a
very significant thing to do, at a time when civilization was thought
to have its world centre in Paris.
