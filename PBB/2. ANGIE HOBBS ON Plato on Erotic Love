Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Back

ANGIE HOBBS ON
Plato on Erotic Love

David Edmonds: The scene: a drinking party, two and a half millennia
ago. The revellers: a philosopher, a soldier-politician, a comic poet and a
tragedian, a physician, a specialist in law. The subject of their discussion:
love. To discuss one of Plato’ s most famous dialogues, The Symposium, and
in particular the nature of erotic love, we spoke to Angie Hobbs, of
Sheffield University.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we’re talking about is Plato on love. We’re
talking about a specific kind of love, Eros. What does Plato mean by that?

Angie Hobbs: The term means erotic love, and I’ve heard it
beautifully described as ‘whatever makes you tingle’. Traditionally,
in Greek literature, erotic love was physical love for someone else’s
body, but what we’re going to see Plato doing throughout his work,
particularly in his great dialogue on love, the Symposium, is
expanding the field of erotic love away from bodies. But the basic
meaning of the term is erotic desire for one other human being.

NW: You’ve mentioned The Symposium. What was that?

AH: It’s a sumptuous dialogue by Plato. It was written in about 385
BC, but mainly set in 416 BC, and it describes a probably apocryphal
symposium, a drinking party, at the house of a tragedian called
Agathon. Amongst the guests we have Socrates, the comic poet
Aristophanes, a doctor, a student of rhetoric, and—probably the most
famous man in Athens of his day—the glamorous, charismatic,
general/statesman/bad boy/rock star figure, Alcibiades. And they all
give their own views on what they think erotic love is: its definition
and origins, its aims and objects, whether it’s beneficial or harmful
to mankind.

NW: Let’s start with Aristophanes. He's got a powerful speech about the
nature of erotic love.

AH: This is one of my favourite passages in western literature. In
keeping with his profession, he gives us this fabulously inventive
comic fantasy. Originally, he says, there were three different sexes of
proto-human beings (though whether they can even be classed as
proto-human is in fact disputed): male, female, and hermaphrodite (a
mixture of male and female). And these beings were initially
spherical. They were completely round, with four arms, four legs,
two heads, two faces, and two sets of genitalia, and they rolled
around the surfaces of the earth like acrobats. But this race got very
uppity, they got above themselves, and the Greek gods, led by Zeus,
wondered what to do about them. If they killed them all off, that
would get rid of the threat but they would also lose all the libations
and sacrifices. So the gods thought: what we’ll do is cut them all in
half. In so doing, we’ll both weaken them, but also double the
number of those offering libations. So Zeus orders Hephaestus—the
blacksmith god—to cut these spherical beings in half to form
creatures with two arms, two legs, one face, one set of genitalia
(initially in the wrong place—we’ll come back to this), and they
mope around the world looking for their lost other half. And,
Aristophanes says, this is what Eros is: it is the search for your
literal other half; it is the desire to be reunited with this other half
and thereby achieve your original state. It’s the yearning and quest to
regain what you’ve lost.

NW: That’s a powerful metaphor for sexual longing, but even in ancient
Greek times it couldn’t have been taken to be literally true?
AH: No, but it’s a very compelling way of evoking the notion of
erotic desire for one other unique, particular, irreplaceable human
being. Except, of course, there is an intriguing question about
whether the missing other half is ever actually viewed by the
questing lover as a whole human, or just as the lost half of him- or
herself, something to be reabsorbed. Plato may be casting a very
beady eye on what we now term ‘romantic love’ and forcing us to
ask uncomfortable questions about the extent of egoism involved in
this kind of love. And there are also complex questions concerning
identity here. But there is no doubt about the fact that the search is a
risky and potentially painful process: you may never bump into your
other half. And even if you do, they could then die on you, and leave
you with no adequate replacement: even if you form another
attachment of some kind, you will always lack your other half. So the
story conjures up all the longing and the intensity, and the passion of
romantic love for one unique particular (whether viewed as a half or
as a whole). But it also conjures up the risks and the dangers and the
potential enslavement of that love.

NW: What happens when you do meet up with your other half?
AH: Well, initially in the myth it’s all very frustrating, because the
genitalia of these beings are in the wrong place, and they can’t
physically make love. So Zeus steps in and orders Hephaestus to
remedy this: their genitalia are moved around and they can now
make physical love. And then what Plato does with this myth gets
really interesting, really intriguing. We are asked to imagine that
these couples are physically intertwined in bed; they are in the midst
of interpenetrative sex and, at this very moment, the blacksmith god,
Hephaestus, arrives at their bedside—you would have thought an
unwelcome and rather tactless visitor. And, interrupting them,
Hephaestus asks: ‘What do you really want? Do you want me to
weld you together, not just in body, but also in soul, so you become
one instead of two?’ And they say, ‘yes, yes, yes, that’s what we
want’. And Hephaestus says: ‘Think carefully. Is this really, really
what you want?’ And they say, ‘yes, yes, weld us, weld us!’ And
that’s where the myth ends. They’re going to be welded together in
life—and I believe Hephaestus is envisaging a spiritual as well as a
physical welding—and they will also be together in death. But the
implication is that Plato, the author of this fantasy, through the
character of Aristophanes, is asking us to think very hard about what
we think romantic love is, and what we want from it. Because when
you are together with your beloved, you can have that very intense
physical and spiritual longing to be absolutely fused. But think what
would happen if that actually occurred: could erotic love continue to
exist? And I think Plato is raising some intriguing questions here,
because he’s saying: If you’re defining love as a search for what you
lack, then what happens if this search finds its object? Does erotic
love tend towards its own annihilation? Because if you find what
you’re looking for, you’ve surely cancelled out the conditions that
make erotic love possible. And do you want that? Are you ok with
that?

NW: That’s Aristophanes. How does Socrates develop these ideas?

AH: When it’s Socrates’ turn to talk, he says he’s going to relay a
conversation he had when young with a (probably fictional)
priestess called Diotima, who—he mischievously says—taught him
everything he knows about eroticism: lovely to have Socrates taught
by an older woman. In the course of this conversation we are told
that love is not love of one’s other half, but only of the good:
Aristophanes has got love wrong. You don’t love something just
because it’s yours—if you have a toothache you want to get rid of the
rotten tooth; you love something or someone because it or they are
good.

NW: So does that mean that lovers are in principle interchangeable for
Socrates?

AH: Yes, they can be. He says that the aim of love is to possess the
good forever, which, of course, implies that we want some form of
immortality. Now, in the Symposium there is no personal immortality
available to us. Your particular personal life is going to come to an
end when you die. So what we all do—in Freudian terminology,
often unconsciously—is to seek various substitute forms of
immortality, and Socrates says there are three of these, which he lists
in ascending order of importance. First and least—in Socrates’ eyes
—you can have children; second, you can perform some glorious
deed like Achilles, which will win you lasting fame; or third, and
best, you can create enduring works of philosophy, literature, bodies
of laws and education, and so on.

That’s the way of achieving the good forever. But, says Socrates,
the way we do any of these things is through a beautiful beloved, a
beautiful love object. In the case of physical children, we physically
fall in love with a beautiful beloved and use that beloved to create
the children. In the case of honour and fame, or works of art and
science, we use our love for a beautiful beloved as our inspiration—
and in some cases, the education of the beloved is itself the creative
work which will survive us. Now these beautiful beloveds, who are
the means by which we achieve these various substitutes for
immortality, are simply a representation or instantiation of what
Diotima calls the Form of Beauty, which is an unchanging, non-
sensible, eternal structure or principle—the perfect and transcendent
principle of beauty. And every beautiful object in this phenomenal
world—animate or inanimate—is simply an inevitably imperfect
instantiation of the single form of beauty. The consequence of this is
that each of the beloveds with whom we fall in love is individually
replaceable. We’re not attracted by their unique particularity as
Aristophanes thought we were; we’re attracted to them solely to the
extent that they are a representation of the Form of Beauty and can
help us towards our ultimate aim of possessing the good forever.

NW: So the things that we tend to value most in life in terms of success,
achievement, family—all those things are actually driven by a love of
beauty?

AH: Absolutely. To put it precisely: love is the desire to possess
the good forever through begetting and bearing offspring by means of
beauty. And it’s no surprise to me whatsoever that Freud was hugely
inspired by this particular speech in the Symposium. Freud says, yes,
there is this basic stream of erotic energy which may then be
channelled and diverted onto different objects. Freud, of course,
calls this rechannelling, ‘sublimation’, and he believes that his
theory of libidinal sublimation is profoundly indebted to Plato’s
theory of erotic rechannelling (though in fact there are also important
differences as well as similarities between the two).

NW: But for Plato love has a metaphysical aspect. It’s connected to his
whole notion of the Theory of Forms.

AH: That’s right. So far we’ve been concentrating on someone
falling in love with a particular person, even if the reason they fall in
love is only because that particular person instantiates the Form.
What we now need to look at is the way Diotima uses this
phenomenon of falling in love with an individual beautiful body and
claims that, in fact, it’s just the first rung of what she calls the ladder
of love—and her account of this ladder is one of the most famous,
powerful, and disturbing passages in western literature. She says:
you start off being physically attracted to one other beautiful body.
But then—anticipating the lyrics of Mick Jagger—you realize that
the beauty of one body is akin to the beauty of all other bodies, so
it’s irrational not to be attracted to all of them. Next you come to
understand that beauty is instantiated more fully in the soul than in
the body, so you now start to fall in love with beautiful souls. And
gradually you ascend this ladder which takes you further and further
away from particular human bodies towards ever more abstract
objects of desire. Because after human souls you turn your attention
to human customs and institutions, and then to all the various
branches of knowledge; and finally, revealed to you in all its glory at
the top of the ladder, is the transcendent ‘vision’ of the Form of
Beauty itself. It is in contemplating this perfect beauty, says Diotima,
that life will be truly liveable. Because if you’re in love with one
beautiful person, you’re enslaved to them, you’re trapped (and, of
course, your beloved could also die, or leave you): it’s a painful,
vulnerable existence. By contrast, the Form of Beauty is always
going to be there for you, eternal and unchanging. But, interestingly,
we may note that it’s never going to love you back, either. The
person dwelling with the Form of Beauty is in a state of bliss—and
Plato uses extremely sexual language to describe the revelation of
the form of beauty: it’s an absolutely climactic vision—but the Form
of Beauty, being perfect, is not the kind of entity that can love. As
we’ve seen, in the Symposium, love stems from lack. So, in contrast
to Christian notions of a loving God, contemplating the Form is a
one-way experience. We may even want to ask whether Eros has
transformed itself into something else at the very top of the ladder.

NW: Alcibiades comes in at a certain point and one reading is that Plato
illustrates Socrates’conception of Eros by the way Socrates reacts to
Alcibiades.

AH: Yes. It’s interesting to look at the language with which
Alcibiades’ entrance is described. Alcibiades, remember, is this
glamorous, charismatic, and ravishingly beautiful man—he was said
to be the most physically beautiful person in Athens, male or female.
And both males and females were in love with him. The one person
who probably wasn’t—despite his claims to the contrary—was
Socrates. In fact, it was Alcibiades who fell in love with Socrates,
turning on its head the normal Athenian upper class convention of the
time, whereby an older man would have an erotic affair with a
younger male lover in his teens. Anyway, this character, Alcibiades,
arrives at our dinner party after Socrates has finished recounting his
conversation with Diotima; so he’s not heard any of the earlier
speeches. He’s drunk and supported by an aulos-girl—such girls
often entertained in more ways than simply playing the aulos. He’s
wearing a wreath of violets and ivy which has tipped over his eye.
Plato describes his entrance with the term ‘suddenly’: exactly the
same term that he used of the revelation of the Form of Beauty. So it
seems that we have to choose: do we want the Form of Beauty or a
particular, beautiful, flawed human being? And when he finds out
about the discussion, Alcibiades says, ‘oh, I’ll tell you all about
love; but not a general account—I’m too drunk for that anyway—I’ll
just describe my particular love for Socrates.’ And you get one of
the most moving and powerful descriptions that I know about what
it’s like to be in love with one other, utterly unique, individual. In
Alcibiades’ case, it’s a very painful experience because Socrates
does not appear to return his love—he certainly won’t allow any
physical consummation. Alcibiades is disarmingly frank about the
pain of rejection that he feels and his anger and jealousy towards
Socrates. So, through Alcibiades, Plato lets us see both the good and
the bad aspects of being in love with a particular individual, whom
you view as unique and irreplaceable. He shows us the beauty and
the romance, and the intensity, and the passion of such a love; he also
shows us the vulnerability and the pain, the jealousy, and the anger.
So even if Plato is ultimately saying, ‘I think you should give all this
up and ascend the ladder of love’, he is also demonstrating to us that
he does know what he’s talking about. He does understand the fierce
intensity and pull of what he’s asking us to give up.

NW: We’ve heard the three different positions. Which do you find the
most attractive?

AH: Well, I’m raised in the romantic tradition, so despite the pain,
the fragility, the transience, I’d have to go with Aristophanes’.
