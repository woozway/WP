Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Back

RICHARD BOURKE ON
Edmund Burke on Politics

Nigel Warburton: When the fog of politics descends, it can be difficult to
see clearly. Now regarded as one of the founders of modern conservatism,
the eighteenth-century thinker Edmund Burke combined political
experience with philosophical insight. Burke believed in the need to
balance two aspects of our humanity: our competitiveness and our
capacity for deference. For him, the French Revolution of 1789, enacted in
the name of liberty, equality, and fraternity, was not only a failure in its
own terms, but a terrible warning of what happens when political
institutions are violently uprooted. Richard Bourke, a historian at Queen
Mary, University of London, is writing a book on Edmund Burke.

David Edmonds: The topic we’re talking about today is Edmund Burke.
Can you explain something about who Edmund Burke was?

Richard Bourke: Edmund Burke was born in Dublin in 1730 to a
Protestant father and a Catholic mother. He spent his youth between
Dublin and the Blackwater Valley in Cork, went to a Quaker school,
proceeded to Trinity College Dublin where he took his
undergraduate degree, and then to London where he studied law. His
early career was spent as a man of letters in London, but he then
moved into a career in parliamentary politics beginning in 1765–66,
and that set the pattern for his life from then on.

DE: His career was defined by a set of contentious political issues …

RB: Yes; when Burke entered Parliament in 1766, the major issues
of the day included the British government’s attempt to tax the
American colonies, which proved highly controversial and led to the
Declaration of Independence and, in due course, to the war between
Britain and America. There was also the hotly debated topic of the
East India Company’s presence in south Asia and how the Company
should administer its affairs. Equally, events in Ireland were proving
controversial. So, virtually everything that was to dominate his
career was already on the table, so to speak, in 1766—with the
exception of the crisis in France, which was not to emerge as an
issue until much later in his career.

DE: We’ll get to the French Revolution later, but he was a supporter of
the breakaway colonies in America?

RB: He was a supporter of opinion in America against the British
crown in the person of George III. I would not say that he was a
supporter of all aspects of the American revolutionary position. On
the one hand, he was worried about the extent of religious radicalism
in America and the extent to which it could be pacified. However, he
did think that efforts should be made to win over American opinion;
here, he stood apart from many of his colleagues in the House of
Commons who thought that American opinion should be disregarded
and that a policy of coercing the colonies should be pursued. His
main worry at that period was the ambitions of George III. As part of
his critical attitude towards what he saw as the overweening
ambitions of the British monarchy, he took the side of the American
colonists. However, he did not do so unquestioningly. For instance,
he didn’t credit the argument that there could be—in the phrase used
at the time—’no taxation without representation’, as a sensible view
of politics, because it seemed to him structurally impossible for
colonists thousands of miles away to have representation in
Parliament.

DE: So his support for them was an anti-George III stance essentially.

RB: That’s definitely the case. He was a Rockinghamite Whig who
vehemently believed George III had disregarded the privileged
status hitherto accorded to Whig connections under the Hanoverians.
George III was taken to be subverting that privileged status by
seeking to abolish party connections whilst accepting Tory aspirants
into government. This, to Burke and his friends, seemed to be a
violation of principle, a dangerous threat to the British constitution.
It made them highly suspicious of the intentions of the new monarch
and the extent to which he might have unconstitutional designs.

DE: What did he think might happen if concessions weren’t made to the
colonies?

RB: Well, his view was that if you couldn’t conciliate America you
would have to conquer America. To conquer America you would
need an army. And you would end up with George III mobilizing
troops in North America for a conquest that would not in any case
succeed. You would have a military state abroad being supported
ironically by a parliamentary government at home, and this seemed
to Burke to be paradoxical, not to say disgraceful and bound to end
in failure.

DE: He’s remembered as the quintessential conservative, and yet
supporting the colonies doesn’t sound like a conservative position.

RB: Well, Burke was not regarded as a conservative as such until
the nineteenth century, and that was basically on account of his
reaction to the Revolution in France. In the eighteenth century,
throughout his career from 1765 through to the French Revolution, he
was regarded as a supporter of the cause of reform, and the cause of
toleration of religious dissent.

DE: Was he also concerned that, if no political compromise with the
colonies could be struck, there was the possibility of a far greater rupture
… America falling into chaos and anarchy?

RB: Yes. For Burke, we live in the fog of politics. Success in that
arena must be based on compromise. One is always dealing with
human beings whose capacity for achievement is matched by their
capacity for destruction. Burke’s view of human nature was such that
one always had to tread a careful line in political reform and also in
one’s preparedness to concede to dissent.

DE: Does that make him a Hobbesian? Does Burke believe that, if you
take away the power of the state, man will fall into war and conflict?

RB: Burke had much in common with Hobbes, but wasn’t exactly a
Hobbesian. Burke’s view was that there were two component parts
to human nature; on the one hand, there was this driving force of
competitiveness in the breast of human beings. But at the same time
there was a tendency towards deference. That is to say, on the one
hand, we compete with one another and that competitiveness,
verging on envy and resentment, can bring us to the brink of conflict
and, in extremis, destruction. But at the same time, Burke thought
human beings are given to deference. They have a capacity for
respect; they are in awe of greatness. This is a modifying disposition
which can impose control on this other more unruly, frenetic, and
factious tendency in human nature.

DE: So these two tendencies, an inclination towards deference, an
inclination towards competition, hold each other in some form of
equilibrium?

RB: In a well-regulated commonwealth, these two passions in
human beings will be held in equilibrium.

DE: Let’s get on to the French Revolution of 1789. Does Burke witness
events at first hand?

RB: No. Burke had been to France 16 years earlier, as he himself
records in his great book on the Revolution published a year after its
outbreak, Reflections on the Revolution in France. He didn’t visit
France after the Revolution, and all his information about
developments depended on reports, correspondence, and the
newspapers.

DE: What was his interpretation of the French Revolution? It proclaimed
liberty, equality, fraternity: is that how Burke saw it?

RB: Well, events moved very quickly in France. In the summer of
1789, Burke responded with uncertainty to what was occurring; it
was an extraordinary event, and he would wait to see how it panned
out. By the autumn, he was becoming alarmed and developed the
following view: that although the French Revolution decked itself
out in the colours of liberty, equality, and fraternity, it was in truth a
sham performance. The French revolutionaries were proclaiming
themselves defenders of equality, but in truth this was an
insurrectionary oligarchy seeking to redistribute property in the name
of equality. In fact, it was instituting an oligarchy of capitalist
speculators.

DE: But it also unleashed a wave of violence which terrified him.

RB: That’s precisely right. He saw a wave of popular passion as
having been unleashed through the country which would be almost
impossible to pacify. That was the emboldened, envious energy of
resentment, such as an appeal to equality was bound to provoke.

DE: Is that because in that equilibrium between conflict and deference,
deference had been swept aside?

RB: That’s exactly right. Burke thought the appeal to equality gave
added licence to competitiveness to verge over into violent conflict
rather than controlled competition. The restraining influence of due
deference, regard for authority, and acceptance of unequal relations
as had previously existed had been cast into the wind.

DE: His anti-revolutionary sentiments are the reason we know him to this
day as a conservative; is it possible to put him on our political spectrum,
from left to right, from Democrat to Republican?

RB: W ell, that’s a difficult question. If I had to encapsulate my
view in a nutshell, I’d say, ‘no’. Many of the ideological slogans and
labels that we employ today are a legacy of the nineteenth century,
and Burke died at the end of the eighteenth. ‘Left’ versus ‘Right’ as a
description of political positions derives from the period of the
French Revolution, specifically from the question of whether the
French monarch should retain certain powers or not. As regards
local issues of the eighteenth century, it’s clearly possible to align
Burke; but it becomes much more complicated after the rise of
modern democratic politics, modern socialism, and modern
totalitarianism.

DE: So, Richard Bourke, in one sense you’re clearly a Bourkean, but are
you an Edmund Burkean?

RB: No, I’m not a Burkean. Burke held views about the
organization of politics which have proved to be falsifiable. He
believed, on the one hand, that property would only be secure if it
was concentrated in the hands of the great. He believed an
aristocratic order was necessary for stability in society. Subsequent
history has proved this to be inaccurate. He also believed that any
attempt at redistribution was a recipe for social chaos. But, of
course, all the redistributive programmes in the United States and in
post-war Europe have proved that not to be case. Social revolution
didn’t take place under Franklin D. Roosevelt, and social revolution
didn’t take place in Germany and Britain after 1945.

DE: Give me an example of Burke’s relevance today. Does he have
anything to say to us about contemporary politics?

RB: Well, I think Burke would have been opposed to the much-
touted contemporary programme or policy of nation-building abroad.
Given that Burke was a reformer and not a revolutionary, he would
have seen a policy of nation-building in far-away places as precisely
a revolutionary programme. Taking the example of Iraq, Burke might
have thought that if you want to build nations abroad you ought to
approach the task as if you were reforming your own. All reform is
liable to encounter reaction. Radical revolutionary attempts at
change are likely to provoke violent reaction. This will only be
quelled by the intervention of military force, and you will then be in
the paradoxical, not to say ironic, position of trying to deliver a
reform programme by means of a military dictatorship.

DE: He thought it wasn’t possible to recreate a political structure from
scratch—you had to work with the grain of a political system.

RB: You had to work with the grain of existing political powers.
The only alternative was and is to abolish them. But, of course, one
of the great lessons of politics is, you can’t abolish your enemies,
you have to come to terms with them.

DE: Do you think he was a great thinker?

RB: Burke is unusual in combining great political insight with
philosophical wisdom. He’s not a great philosopher of the order of
Thomas Hobbes, but he had great, great political experience
compared, say, to Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Karl Marx had
comparatively little, too. What Burke has to offer are the insights of
a politician who’s educated in the traditions of political thought.
