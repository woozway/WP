Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Back

ANTHONY KENNY ON
Thomas Aquinas’ Ethics

David Edmonds: The most significant philosopher of the medieval
period, Thomas Aquinas, was born in what in the thirteenth century was
called the Kingdom of Sicily. He attended several universities, among them
the University of Naples. After training as a priest, and joining the
Dominican Order, he became a theologian. He wrote on a huge range of
topics, including a detailed examination of several proofs for the existence
of God. But here, Anthony Kenny, a leading specialist on Thomas Aquinas,
discusses Aquinas’ writings on ethics.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we’re focusing on is Thomas Aquinas, and
specifically his ethics. Can you first give a quick sketch of who Aquinas
was?

Anthony Kenny: Aquinas lived in the middle of the thirteenth
century, which is the highest point of the high Middle Ages. He was
a Dominican friar who spent most of his life in universities, such as
the new University of Paris. Universities were new then, as were the
begging friars and the preaching friars: the Franciscans and the
Dominicans. Between them, they more or less shaped the intellectual
life of the thirteenth century.

Aquinas’ great contribution was the way in which he reconciled
Aristotelian philosophy with Christian theology. At the beginning of
his life, Aristotle was largely forbidden by the church authorities; by
the end of his life, most of Aristotle’s texts were obligatory material
in the universities. And this change was mainly due to the genius of
Aquinas.

NW: What did Aquinas take from Aristotle’s ethics?

AK: Aristotle’s ethics is based most of all on the concept of
happiness, on what is the most worthwhile life for a human being.
Aristotle thought that the most worthwhile life involved the exercise
of virtues of various kinds. These included both ordinary virtues,
such as courage and temperance, but also intellectual virtues, such as
the pursuit of science and philosophy. He thought that in a full life
people would achieve their happiness by doing well at what they
were best.

If you think that happiness is the exercise of the different virtues
then, of course, you have to explain what a virtue is, and why it will
be enjoyable to pursue it. Many undergraduates, from many
generations, have read Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics and learned
what Aristotle has to say about this.

Now, this is the main foundation of Aquinas’ ethics, too. Aquinas’
ethics is also based on happiness, it’s ‘Eudaimonistic’. But, of
course, being a Christian, Aquinas adds an extra level of happiness.
Whereas Aristotelian happiness is to be found principally, but not
totally, in the present world, for Aquinas perfect happiness awaits
the blessed in heaven. But he is very much in favour of Aristotle’s
account of the best way to spend your lifetime down here on Earth.

NW: We should be absolutely clear about one point, though: for
Aristotle, and presumably for Aquinas as well, happiness isn’t a blissful
mental state. It’s not merely a sensation.

AK: That’s quite right. That’s a major difference with most popular
forms of ethics today. A very widespread form of ethics today is
utilitarianism, which was founded by Jeremy Bentham, the late
eighteenth-century, early nineteenth-century British philosopher.
Bentham agrees with Aristotle that happiness is the fundamental
concept—the thing on which all morality is to be based. In
Bentham’s case he writes that what is important is the greatest
happiness of the greatest number. But Bentham has a very different
view of happiness from Aristotle and Aquinas. Both Aristotle and
Aquinas thought that happiness was an activity, not a feeling, and that
the supreme happiness for rational beings was an intellectual
activity. For Bentham, however, happiness is exactly the same as
sensation: he draws no distinction between pleasure and happiness.

One big difference this makes concerns the kind of relationship
you believe there is between human beings and other animals. For
Aristotle and Aquinas, since happiness and virtue were the exercise
of rational powers, only human beings belong inside the moral
community. Whereas, if the fundamental principles of ethics depend
on pleasure and pain, then animals must belong to the same moral
community, since they too can feel these sensations.

It doesn’t follow from the fact that Aristotle and Aquinas thought
that animals weren’t part of the moral community that you can
mistreat animals. We can have obligations to creatures that aren’t
part of our own moral community. When I say they’re not part of our
own moral community, I mean they don’t have duties. For Aquinas,
you can only have rights if you also have duties. Aquinas, of course,
didn’t think God was part of our moral community either. God was
above it, in the way that animals were below it. But that doesn’t
mean that we don’t have obligations to God, too.

NW: How did Aquinas develop Aristotle’s ideas?

AK: Being a Christian, Aquinas has a number of extra virtues to
add to the Pagan virtues of Aristotle. There’s the famous triad from
St Paul’s Epistles: the triad of faith, hope, and charity. Faith—belief
in the Christian revelation; hope—for the Christians, heaven; charity
—love for God and our neighbour. He thinks these are in no way in
conflict with the Aristotelian virtues, though they’re something
grander. They’re built on top of other Aristotelian virtues but they
don’t supersede them.

NW: In Christian theology, there are absolute commands about how you
should behave—the Ten Commandments, obviously. Did Aquinas believe
that there were absolute prohibitions on what we could do?

AK: Yes he did. As did Aristotle. When Aristotle is expounding his
Doctrine of the Mean, he says there are some things that don’t have
‘the right amount’. Any amount of murder or adultery, for example, is
too much. But Aquinas is living in a context in which morality could
be said to be founded on the Ten Commandments, on the notion of
law. What Aquinas does is try to put together the Judeo-Christian
notion of law as a basis of morality and the Aristotelian notion of
virtue as the key element in morality. Later Christian thinkers
emphasised law rather than virtue right up to and beyond the
Reformation. Immanuel Kant is the apotheosis of the notion of law—
and duty—as the central concept of morality. In Aquinas, the
proportion is quite different. He does discuss the law. He discusses
the revealed law as well as the natural law—the latter, he thinks,
God implanted in all our hearts—but much more of his ethical
treatises are concerned with virtue than with law.

Let me return for a moment to Jeremy Bentham and utilitarianism.
There’s a big distinction between Bentham, on the one hand, and
Aristotle, Aquinas, and Kant, on the other. Those last three all
thought that there were some kinds of actions you should never do,
no matter what the consequences. Whereas for Bentham and the
utilitarian tradition, the consequences are the test of whether
something is right or not. This important difference still survives in
contemporary moral debate. There are some absolutists who say that
there are certain things one should never do—many people would
say torture and rape could never be justified. But if you’re a
thorough-going utilitarian you’ll say, ‘No, in certain circumstances,
fortunately very rare, torture and rape may be justified.’

NW: You mentioned that Aquinas’ lower-level principles are actually
quite extensive: can you give us a flavour of what they’re like?

AK: One important issue which he often discusses is the role of
conscience, and the question of whether you should always obey
your conscience. A lot of people have thought that, as long as you
were obeying your conscience, everything was all right. Aquinas
rejects this. Your conscience may well be ill-informed, and you have
a duty to better inform it. If you disobey your conscience, he says,
you’re doing something wrong. But the mere fact that you’re obeying
your conscience doesn’t necessarily mean that what you’re doing is
right. This is relevant to a number of contemporary issues. A lot of
people believe that when the former British Prime Minister Tony
Blair went to war in Iraq he was obeying his conscience. But
Aquinas—and I agree with him about this—would say that this
doesn’t settle the question of whether Mr Blair acted rightly or not.

NW: Aquinas is probably best known as a theologian. Is there a way of
following Aquinas’ philosophy without committing to Christianity?

AK: Indeed. Some of the best recent writers on Aquinas haven’t
been Christians. Aquinas himself makes it easy to follow him
without accepting the Christian premises.

In the history of philosophy, Aquinas was the first to make a sharp
distinction between two kinds of theology: what he calls Revealed
Theology and Natural Theology. Revealed Theology takes as its
premises some sacred book or authoritative teaching of the church.
But Aquinas says there’s another kind of theology, a branch of
philosophy, which avoids the use of those premises even if it thinks
they’re true. It starts only with things which can be proved by reason
without any appeal to an alleged revelation.

He wrote a book, the Summa Contra Gentiles —the summary of
teaching for the purpose of infidels. The Summa Contra Gentiles
was expressly designed to be used in dialogue with Jews and
Muslims. He says at the beginning of this book that when you’re
writing with Jews against Jews, of course you can quote the Hebrew
bible. But we don’t have any books that we share with the Muslims,
and so the best thing to do, whether you’re dealing with Jews or with
Muslims, is just to appeal to natural reason and common sense.

NW: You sound quite sympathetic to Aquinas’ approach—especially
when contrasted with utilitarianism?

AK: Yes, I am. First of all, I think that his general approach to
ethics is correct, giving importance to happiness and virtue rather
than law. I also think that, often, his treatment of particular lower-
level issues is very sensitive. His style of writing is based on the
medieval disputation: an academic exercise in which two graduate
students would argue with each other, and then the professor would
settle the debate between them—very much like the adversarial
practice of the Common Law courts. And it’s probably the courts that
imitated the scholastics rather than the other way around.

This adversarial style of philosophy is rather a good style, and
Aquinas always begins his treatment of a topic by setting out the
position opposite to the one that he is going to defend and by
presenting arguments for it. When you look up Aquinas to see ‘Is
there a God’? And the first thing you read is ‘apparently not’. It’s a
very good intellectual discipline to think, ‘Now, what’s to be said on
the other side?’ His philosophical approach is wonderfully
judicious. He’s always trying to balance arguments from both sides.
If he’s arguing with somebody, he usually tries to make them emerge
as well as they can, even if he’s going to disagree with them.

Aquinas deserves to be treated by us in the way that he treated
Aristotle. He learned a great deal from Aristotle; he was never
afraid to contradict Aristotle, but did it in a civil way. We should
behave towards Aquinas the way he behaved towards Aristotle.

NW: Most students studying philosophy come across Aquinas in the
theological context or in the philosophy of religion. Yet there are signs that
he’s becoming a more important philosopher today than he was 10 or 15
years ago.

AK: I think that’s right. This morning, I was reading a massive
history of ethics by Professor Terence Irwin (of Oxford University),
and I was very impressed to see that he devotes about twice as many
pages to the ethics of Aquinas as he does to Aristotle’s ethics. He is
probably right to do so. But it would have been hard to imagine this
happening 10 years ago.
