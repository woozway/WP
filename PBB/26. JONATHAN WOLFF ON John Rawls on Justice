Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Back

JONATHAN WOLFF ON
John Rawls on Justice

David Edmonds: Many contemporary political philosophers are proud to
call themselves ‘Rawlsian’—disciples of John Rawls. Among academics
there’s an extraordinary degree of consensus that the most important work
of political philosophy from the second half of the last century was Rawls’
A Theory of Justice, published in 1971. The book’s influence has been felt
well beyond the university campus. Its radical claim that what matters
most in society is the position of the worst-off has filtered through to
politicians and policy makers. Jonathan Wolff is a professor of philosophy
at University College London.

Nigel Warburton: We are going to focus on John Rawls’ A Theory of
Justice, probably the most famous work of political philosophy of the
twentieth century. Could you tell me a bit about John Rawls and who he
was?

Jonathan Wolff: John Rawls was an American philosopher who
worked from the 1950s until the end of the century—so he had a long
working life. He concentrated on political philosophy for most of his
life. He began writing important papers in political philosophy in the
late 1950s and never stopped—and, in a sense, still hasn’t stopped,
because there is still more of his work being discovered even 10
years or so after his death.

He was based for most of his life in Harvard and, as you say, his
major work was A Theory of Justice, published in 1971. That was a
continuation of work he had started in the 1950s, and after he
finished work on the theory of justice he carried on developing his
theory, seeing new problems, seeking solutions, new applications,
and so on. It was his life’s work.

NW: What was the key idea in this book?

JW: Rawls put forward what looks at first like a very simple theory
of justice: what he called his ‘Two Principles of Justice’—in fact
there are three of them, so it’s quite a mystery why he called them the
‘two principles’. The first of Rawls’ principles is known as the
‘Liberty Principle’, which says that each person is entitled to an
equal and extensive set of basic liberties. Everyone is entitled to the
sort of civil rights and liberties that one tends to have in liberal,
highly developed societies. The second principle gets a bit more
interesting, it splits into two: one of them is known as the
‘Difference Principle’; and the other is known as the ‘Fair
Opportunity Principle’.

The ‘Fair Opportunity Principle’ again seems rather bland; it says
that everyone is entitled to fair equality of opportunity, although
Rawls interprets this in a more radical way than those on the
political right would do. But the ‘Difference Principle’ is where
things get really interesting. The ‘Difference Principle’ concerns the
distribution of income and wealth in society. Now Rawls’ view is
that there is a sense in which fairness requires an equal distribution
of income and wealth, but he says, it may be that inequalities in
society could be to everyone’s benefit. For example, a competitive
economy with higher wages going to very productive people could
create incentives, and that could make everyone better off. So, his
view is that although fairness in a sense requires equality, if
everyone, literally everyone, would be better off by inequality, then
inequality is justified. And that’s the ‘Difference Principle’. The
‘Difference Principle’ says that inequality is justified only if it
makes the worst-off as well-off as possible. This is Rawls’ highly
distinctive contribution to political philosophy.

NW: But he didn’t just pluck these ideas out of the air, did he? He had a
particular way of arriving at these conclusions.

JW: That’s right. When you say he didn’t pluck them out of the air,
one way of understanding that is that someone must have had those
ideas before he did, and another is that he must have had arguments
for them. Now, Rawls was very respectful to the traditions in
political philosophy, and if he could possibly attribute any of his
ideas to anyone else, he would do. He was, in a way, the opposite of
many of us: he didn’t seem to crave originality, he craved the
reverse. So he tried to stick his ideas on other people, and he could
do that with the ‘Liberty Principle’ to some degree, and the
‘Opportunity Principle’, but one of the remarkable things is that not
even Rawls could find anyone who held the ‘Difference Principle’
before him. True, it has been argued that inequalities were justified
if they were to the advantage of the worst-off. This was a common
thing to say in the 1940s, for example, by British Labour politicians,
who suggested that inequalities are justified if they make all of us
better off. But Rawls added a further twist: it’s not enough that they
should make us all better off, they have to make the worst-off as
well-off as possible. Rawls seems to have been the first person to
suggest such an idea.

NW: But how did he get to that position? What reasoning led him to that
conclusion?

JW: Well, what is so interesting about Rawls is that he didn’t just
have a radical theory, a new theory: he had a radical new argument.
Rawls realizes how difficult it is to argue for any principle in
political philosophy, but in Rawls’ case, he used the method of a
hypothetical contract, also known as the ‘Original Position’. Rawls’
idea is that, quite often, people disagree about justice because
they’re biased by their own interests. If I knew that I was rich, I
might be very much against taxation; if I knew I was poor, I might be
very much in favour. Who’s right, the rich person or the poor person?
Rawls’ response to this is to say, ‘Well, let’s take these two people
and let us imagine that they don’t know if they are rich or poor, could
they then come to an agreement of some sort?’ What type of taxation
would you like in your society if you didn’t know whether you were
rich or poor? Would you agree to racial discrimination in your
society if you didn’t know what race you were? Would you agree to
sexual discrimination if you didn’t know what sex you were? Rawls’
basic idea is to say: let us strip things that could bias people—in
imagination, of course. You have to imagine yourself stripped of
anything that might lead you to be prejudiced in your own favour.
Accordingly, Rawls proposes that we should imagine people getting
together, not knowing how wealthy they are, what race they are, what
sex they are, not even what their conception of the good is, in other
words, what they like in life. Then he asks: how would these people
design society, what principles of justice would people in this
hypothetical contract situation agree to, behind what he calls the
‘veil of ignorance’?

NW: So, in this imaginary case, I’m behind the veil of ignorance, I don’t
know what position I’m going to occupy in society: that’s what Rawls calls
the Original Position. I have to think through what principles would create
a fair society in that situation. Is that right?

JW: It’s half right. It was right up until the last point where you said
that people behind the veil of ignorance have to ask themselves what
would be a fair society. In fact, Rawls says that the veil of ignorance
itself ensures fairness. What these people should be asking is what in
their selfish interests they would want. If you didn’t know what your
role in society was going to be, how would you selfishly want
society to be designed? If you didn’t know whether you were going
to be a manual worker or whether you were going to be a city
banker, what wage differentials would you want to have in society
between the city banker and the manual worker? Possibly not the
ones we’ve got at the moment.

NW: So Rawls reaches these radical conclusions about how we should
structure society. But what does this mean in practice? If we always have
to increase the income of those worst-off, does it mean there won’t be
opera, or people won’t be able to go on holiday to the Bahamas?

JW: Well, the principles he draws up are at a fairly abstract and
high level. They’re principles to regulate what he calls the basic
structure of society: they’re not meant to be principles that guide our
day-by-day behaviour. Rawls himself doesn’t say that you as an
individual have a moral duty to make the worst-off as well-off as
possible; he’s not telling you to give your money away: that will be
dealt with by the tax system. So, for us, we will have all the
freedoms under a Rawlsian society that we have now. There could
be opera if people want it, and are prepared to pay for it, maybe
even at public expense if people want to vote for that. But the main
thing that Rawls wants to say is that, ultimately, the institutions of our
society should be arranged to guarantee equal basic liberties and fair
opportunity, and the economic system should be set up so that simply
by living our normal lives—going to work, paying our taxes but
otherwise spending our money how we wish—the worst-off will
become as well-off as possible. He does not think he is asking for
heroic self-sacrifice.

NW: That’s the theory. Now, there are objections that can be laid against
this, surely? For instance, it’s not obvious that I wouldn’t want the
opportunity of a big pay-off. I might want to gamble from my position
behind the veil of ignorance because it would be quite nice to enter with a
ticket for the lottery that might just win.

JW: This is a criticism that Rawls faced probably from the first day
he ever wrote his theory: that he’s saying that behind the veil of
ignorance you should really play very, very safe. You should try to
arrange things so that the worst-off are as well-off as possible. And
you’re saying, in response to Rawls, well maybe it’s worth a bit of a
gamble. Maybe I could gamble a little bit for the sake of great
wealth, and wouldn’t it be rational for me to do this? And, in
particular, utilitarian critics say, ‘Well, why shouldn’t we gamble
quite considerably? Isn’t it rational to gamble under some
circumstances, even if you know you can lose?’

Now, what Rawls did later on in his work was to try to clarify the
difference between his view and the utilitarian one. First of all, he
asks, what are you prepared to gamble with? Of course, you talk
about gambling with your money, but would you gamble with your
liberties? Would you gamble with your opportunities? Rawls thinks
it’s not rational to gamble with your liberties or opportunities, and
so, he says, the Liberty Principle and the Opportunity Principle are
fairly resistant to the gambling argument. Rawls says the first victory
against utilitarianism is to establish the Liberty Principle and the
Opportunity Principle.

Having done that, he says, well, maybe someone will come back
and suggest a mixed principle of justice with the Liberty Principle
and the Opportunity Principle, and then a utilitarian principle for
distributing money. Now Rawls’ first answer to that is that this is
just too risky: if you were in the Original Position and had to think
about your total life prospects, it would be irrational to take a big
risk. It would be ridiculous to risk your livelihood for the sake of a
lottery game, because you could end up in the gutter. But there’s an
obvious reply to Rawls, which is to say, well, let’s rule out the grave
risks. Let’s have a safety net. Instead of making the worst-off as
well-off as possible, why not have the Liberty Principle, the
Opportunity Principle, the safety net, and then a bit of utilitarianism
for gambling. Even so, Rawls still thinks it would be more rational
to go for the Difference Principle in the Original Position. Partly,
this may be a view about money not being terribly important; a rather
romantic socialist view: once people have got enough, why should
they strive for more? And that may be fair enough, if you do have a
high minimum, why would you want to gamble some of that for the
sake of crazy gain? So, in the end, I think, your choice behind the
veil of ignorance would come down to a matter of temperament. The
argument for the Difference Principle is not in my view stone cold,
but it’s pretty good.

NW: As I understand it, John Rawls gave precedence to liberty above all
his other principles. Why was that?

JW: That’s correct. The Liberty Principle for Rawls has ‘lexical
priority’ over the other principles, at least once we all have enough
to eat. It’s a hard thing to argue for, but the sorts of examples people
use concern things like the justification of slavery or, more recently,
apartheid in South Africa. Some defenders of apartheid argued that
white rule in South Africa was actually better for the blacks because
of economic prosperity, and therefore it was better for black people
not to have the vote. This is an argument that has been made time and
time again; that if poor people are given the vote they will mess
things up. Now, you might argue against that on empirical grounds,
arguing that black people in South Africa would use the vote very
responsibly. But Rawls’ answer would be, well, that’s not the
criterion. If people don’t have the vote, if they’re not given basic
political liberties, if they are discriminated against, then that is
enough reason to change the system, whatever the consequences for
economic prosperity.

NW: That seems to suggest another criticism of Rawls: who’ s doing the
imagining in the Original Position? A bunch of liberal philosophers in a
Harvard seminar? We’re not talking about a bunch of fascists here. What
would the fascists choose? The structure of this thought experiment allows
you to smuggle in your prejudices.

JW: Well, that’s a very important point. The basic motivation for
Rawls’ theory, in my view, is the thought that ignorance is a way of
modelling impartiality. If you make people ignorant of certain things,
they have no choice to be partial. But there is a question, as you
rightly say, about what you should be made ignorant of. You’re made
ignorant of your race, of your sex, of your earning power, but why
those things? If you’re made ignorant of what Rawls calls your
conception of the good, the things you like in life, well, you don’t
know that you even like liberty or opportunity, and so how can you
make a choice at all? What Rawls says is that we’ve got to assume
that people value what he calls the primary goods. These primary
goods are roughly speaking liberty, opportunity, what he calls the
social basis of self-respect, and money: income and wealth. And
Rawls’ justification for this is that these are the things that you
would value, whatever else you valued in life. Whatever your
conception of the good, whatever you want out of life, liberty,
opportunity, and money, and the social basis of self-respect, are all-
purpose means for achieving it.

NW: But, surely, there are people who’ve got completely different
conceptions of the good: a monk for instance, who wants to spend a
spiritual life meditating, and is not in the least concerned with money.
Money wouldn’t even enter into his world.

JW: Money might even be an obstacle. It is true there are some
people who choose to be monks. Rawls would say, they have chosen
to be monks. They weren’t forced to be monks, they have made that
decision, therefore they value liberty, they value the liberty to be a
monk, and they value the opportunity to be a monk. If they weren’t
given that opportunity, that would be a problem for them. It is true
that they may not want to have wealth, but nevertheless they might
still want to live in a society where the worst-off are as well-off as
possible. Monks do good works: they want to try to improve the
material conditions of other people, even if they opt out for
themselves on the whole. So, Rawls could say that these are all-
purpose means. But there is a residual worry here. The monk may
value a type of community, because of social solidarity, or ideas of
collective, or common good. It’s less clear that opportunity, liberty,
and money, are ways of achieving common goods. This was a
criticism made by Michael Sandel and other communitarians: that the
theory of John Rawls is biased towards liberal individualistic
conceptions of the good.

NW: Rawls’ theories have been tremendously influential in academic
circles, but did they actually change anything politically?

JW: It’s always hard to trace the connection between ideas and
practice. In the early 1980s, at a Social Democratic Party
conference, a proposal was made to adopt Rawls’ theory as the
official philosophy of the party. This was turned down on the
grounds that no one could understand it. But Gordon Brown read
Rawls, and many of the current crop of both Labour and
Conservative politicians studied Rawls’ theory and have taken in
Rawls’ ideas. If you look across public policy now, there is a
special concern for the worst-off in society: that a failing society is
one that fails the worst-off, and where there is an excluded group of
people with no stake in society. Broadly across politics, at least in
Europe, and maybe now in America, although things have been
rather different there over the last decades, there’s particular
concern with how the worst-off are faring and with important social
programmes to address disadvantage. Furthermore, within the civil
service, until fairly recently, a type of utilitarianism was dominant.
Civil servants were very interested in cost–benefit analysis: they
were interested in promoting programmes if the benefits outweighed
the costs. This is still true, but there is now a concern for the worst-
off, and the distribution of benefits. A few years ago, the Treasury
made changes to the Green Book, its official guidance, introducing a
weighting system, where the benefits to the poor were counted as
more important than benefits to the rich, a change which is arguably
influenced by Rawls.

NW: So Rawls has probably had some impact on the real world of
politics. But he has had a huge impact on academic political philosophy. I
wonder if you could just summarize that impact.

JW: We can date political philosophy, at least in the twentieth
century, to pre-Rawls and post-Rawls. Between John Stuart Mill and
Rawls, there’s no one of the same stature. You can spend a lifetime,
and people have, as a scholar of Rawls. There are very few political
philosophers between Mill and Rawls for whom that would have
been a sensible way of spending your time. What Rawls did was
completely change the mood in political philosophy. His first
substantive papers came out in the 1950s. To understand the impact,
it’s quite interesting to look at what else was going on at the same
time. We were in the late legacy of Logical Positivism, and ordinary
language philosophy. Most work in political philosophy was a
matter of pretending to clarify terms. There would be books called
‘The Vocabulary of Politics’, and papers discussing ‘the grammar of
sovereignty’. Political philosophy was very inward-focused and
cautious, and to the outsider looked moribund. Then along came
Rawls, with a theory and an argument for it. At that time, even to
present a theory and an argument was very unusual, and no one had
set out such a systematic and plausible theory for perhaps a hundred
years.
