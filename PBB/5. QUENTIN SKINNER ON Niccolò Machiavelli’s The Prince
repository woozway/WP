Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Back

QUENTIN SKINNER ON
Niccolò Machiavelli’s The Prince

David Edmonds: Niccolò Machiavelli, Italian diplomat and author of The
Prince, is in a select group of people—it includes Freud and Kafka—who
have had their name turned into an adjective. So what is it to be a true
Machiavellian? What approach to the running of a state did Machiavelli
advocate and why? There’s no better person to ask than the eminent
historian of ideas, Quentin Skinner.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we’re focusing on today is one of the great
books in the history of political thought, Machiavelli’s The Prince. Could
you explain who Machiavelli was?

Quentin Skinner: Machiavelli didn’t initially expect to be
remembered as a political theorist at all. He began by following a
diplomatic career, but it was rudely interrupted in 1512, and it’s
between that date and his death in 1527 that he composed all the
works by which he is now known. He wrote not merely as a political
theorist but also as a poet and playwright, and one of his plays—
Mandragola, probably written in 1518—still holds the stage
nowadays. But we think of him as the author above all of Il Principe
[The Prince] which was written in 1513, immediately after he lost
his official position with the change of regime in Florence in the
previous year.

NW: So he was working as a diplomat before he was a political theorist?

QS: Yes, that’s right. I think of his early life as coming in two
halves. He’s born in 1469, but almost nothing is known about him
until 1498. We know that his father was a lawyer, who ensured that
his son received a good humanist education, but essentially we don’t
hear about Machiavelli until he suddenly emerges to prominence in
Florentine politics in 1498. That was the year in which the Papacy
got fed up with Savonarola, who had effectively been running
Florence since 1494 after the French invasion and the removal of the
Medici. The Pope trumped up a charge of heresy, and Savonarola
was burnt at the stake. That’s the moment when Machiavelli
suddenly appears on the scene, and one of his earliest extant letters
is about the collapse of the Savonarolan regime. Machiavelli was
only in his late twenties at the time, but when the new republican
regime under Piero Soderini was set up in the spring of 1498,
Machiavelli was at once appointed as Secretary to the Second
Chancery.

NW: In his role in the state there, what kinds of things will he be doing?

QS: As Secretary to the Second Chancery he was also, and ex-
officio, secretary to a committee known as the Dieci (‘The Ten’ or
‘The Ten of War’). They were responsible for the diplomatic and
foreign relations of the republic. Machiavelli was not an aristocrat,
so he couldn’t be an ambassador, but he acted as a secretary to
numerous embassies. As early as 1500 he was sent to France,
because the Florentines, who were traditional allies of the French,
wanted to know what France’s intentions were concerning Italy.
Machiavelli had audiences with King Louis XII on several
occasions during this trip. Two years later, it’s he who’s chosen to
go to the court of Cesare Borgia, who had been granted lands in the
Romagna by his father, Pope Alexander VI. Popes are not supposed
to have sons but this one did. Florence was worried that Cesare
might be going to march across their territories and possibly
devastate them, and Machiavelli was sent to find out his plans and
report back.

Then, in 1503 it’s Machiavelli who is sent to cover the papal
election in Rome. When Cardinal Rovere is elevated as Pope Julius
II, it’s Machiavelli who conveys the news to Florence. In 1507, he
goes on an embassy to the court of the Holy Roman Emperor,
Maximilian, whom he also meets. These embassies continue: in
1510 he’s back in France, and again has an audience with Louis XII.
So he’s met the King of France, he’s met the Pope, he’s met the
Emperor, and many of his reflections about these statesmen go into
The Prince.

If we now turn to The Prince, we find that Machiavelli thinks
very poorly of these leaders. The King of France, as he explains in
chapter 3, totally messed up the invasion of Italy. Of Maximilian he
says in chapter 23 that nobody ever knows what he’s going to do,
least of all him: he announces that he’s going to undertake some
policy but then somebody else talks to him and he changes his mind
immediately. He says of Pope Julius II in chapter 25 that, although he
was successful, he was simply lucky: he was basically a warrior,
which is what was needed at the time, but if other qualities had been
appropriate, he would soon have come to grief. The only political
leader of his age whom Machiavelli truly admires is Cesare Borgia,
but as he points out in chapter 7 of The Prince, even Cesare failed
ignominiously in the end.

NW: How did Machiavelli come to write The Prince? How did he make
the move from being a diplomat to being a writer?

QS: He was forced to make the move shortly after Pope Julius II
signed the ill-named ‘Holy Alliance’ in 1512, which had the effect
of bringing Spanish troops into Italy. They quickly pushed the French
out. The Florentines, traditional allies of the French, were then
threatened with the sack of their territories, and caved in at once.
The Medici returned, and many of those who had served the republic
were dismissed. It’s true that some survived: several of
Machiavelli’s aristocratic friends remained employed under the new
regime. But Machiavelli had the misfortune to be mistakenly—so far
as is known—identified as having taken part in an anti-Medicean
plot immediately after their reassumption of power. So he’s
imprisoned and dreadfully tortured. Only at the beginning of 1513,
when there’s an amnesty—because a Medici becomes Pope—does
Machiavelli get released. But he’s then sent into internal exile. He
has to go back to his farm, south of Florence, and he’s left asking
himself what he should do with his energies and his literary powers.
It’s then that he settles down, at the beginning of 1513, to write a
book about what he has learned from his time as an observer of
political life.

NW: He imagines these conversations with the great thinkers of the past
and the people that he’s met as part of the process of writing?

QS: Yes, that’s fascinating. There’s a celebrated letter of December
1513 to his friend Francesco Vettori in which he explains his writing
practices. He wants to understand the secrets of statecraft known to
the great moralists of Rome, Seneca and Cicero, and the great
Roman historians, Livy, Sallust, and Tacitus. These are the
authorities he is reading. But in order to talk to them, he says, he has
to wait till the end of the day, go into his study, put on special robes,
and then ask them questions which, under those circumstances, they
feel able to answer.

NW: The Prince is an unusual book for us, but it was within a recognized
genre.

QS: Absolutely. It’s completely conventional in the way it’s
organized. When Machiavelli writes to Vettori, he tells him that he is
composing a little book called De Principatibus (concerning
principalities). It’s interesting that he assigns it a Latin title, because
one remarkable thing about the book is that it’s in Italian and not in
Latin. But, as you say, he is aligning his work with a well-recognized
genre. Giovanni Pontano had recently written a book called De
Principe, and Francesco Patrizi a similar book called De rege. Such
works of admonition and advice to rulers were commonplace in
Renaissance Italy, and Machiavelli’s The Prince is simply another
example of such a speculum principis or ‘mirror for princes’.

NW: So what was Machiavelli’s main intellectual aim with The Prince?

QS: Yes, a crucial question. He doesn’t answer it specifically until
the pre-penultimate chapter, chapter 24, when he says that he has
been writing a book particularly for new princes, his aim being to
make them appear to be old ones. By ‘old’ he simply means ‘well-
established’ because, as he says at the beginning of the book, he
believes that if you have inherited your principality, it would be very
incompetent of you not to be able to sustain your position. The big
problems arise when you are a new prince, and it’s for rulers in that
predicament that his advice is designed.

NW: So if it’s a kind of bluffer’s guide for new princes it involves
dissimulation: you have to pretend to be something that you’re not. How
important is that as a theme in the book?

QS: It is in a way absolutely central. But I think one would first
want to note that his guide for new princes is addressed more
specifically to one particular family, the Medici. It’s dedicated to
Giuliano de Medici, one of the young princes restored in 1512. But
he dies, and then Machiavelli revises the book in 1516 and
rededicates it to the rather chinless Lorenzo de Medici. They were
not very plausible candidates for greatness. Nevertheless, what
Machiavelli says at the end of The Prince is that he believes they
can attain what he calls gloria duplicata, double glory. This will be
achieved, he says, if they succeed in founding a new state in
Florence and then ornamenting it with good laws. Notice the
emphasis on glory. The question for Machiavelli is always how
princes can hope to appear not merely powerful but honourable and
glorious at the same time. They should aim not just to seize and hold
on to power but to display ‘the power and the glory’ to everyone.

NW: One reading of this book, from what you’ve said, is that it was
written very specifically for an individual, it had a target audience of one
person.

QS: That’s a good way of putting it. Of course, Machiavelli
believes that what he says applies generally to rulers who come to
power without being legitimate. But you are right that he is
particularly interested in one ruler. As has often been said of The
Prince, it is, as it were, a job application. Machiavelli wants to get
back into power himself, he wants to commend himself to the new
regime in Florence. In the correspondence with his friend, Francesco
Vettori, he’s very anxious that his book should be presented to the
Medici princes. Vettori reads it and is clearly horrified, and keeps
putting him off. This is not perhaps surprising, for when you read the
work, you’ll see that—as has sometimes been said—it looks almost
as if it’s a satire designed to mislead princes, because the advice is
so completely unconventional, although the format is so completely
conventional. It’s like a bomb in a prayer-book, as J. R. Hale once
put it.

NW: ‘Conventional’ here would presumably be something like Christian
morality. The Prince doesn’t advocate straightforward compassion,
kindness, the sorts of things which were prized by Christians.

QS: Yes, that is right, but I would want to put it more exactly. As
you begin to read the book, what you learn is that, although your
ultimate goal as a prince is glory, you first have to know how to
stabilize your state. One phrase that runs throughout The Prince
speaks of the basic obligation of every ruler: mantenere lo stato.
Not, of course, ‘to maintain the state’—that would be an
anachronism—but to maintain his state as a prince, to maintain his
standing and position of power. You must know how to avoid what
the French called a blow against your state, a coup d’état. You must
ensure above all that you are not unhorsed.

NW: How according to Machiavelli should a prince attain stability?

QS: Any prince attempting to attain stability faces a dangerous
enemy, an enemy he must learn to cope with. This foe is mentioned
all through The Prince, and its name is Fortuna. Princes need to
acknowledge that to achieve stability they’ve got to be fortunate. One
of the deep points that Machiavelli wants to make is that there’s no
such thing as a successful politician who hasn’t had phenomenally
good luck. But he also believes—to cite the useful American idiom
—that it is possible to ‘get lucky’.

Fortune is the name of that force which is completely capricious.
You can’t rely on it, it’s the opposite of reason, but you’ve got to
reckon with it because misfortune can completely overthrow you—
as happened to Cesare Borgia. Machiavelli says in chapter 7 that he
offers Cesare as an example of everything that a prince should do to
maintain his state and attain glory. However, Cesare fell desperately
ill at the moment when his enemies were coming for him. Now, as
Machiavelli adds, this was nothing more than an example of the
extreme malignity of Fortune. But it meant that Cesare lost his state.
So Fortune is the name of the force that can always crush you,
however well you plan. But—and this Machiavelli takes from Livy
—Fortuna fortes adiuvat, fortune favours the brave. You need to
know how to get lucky, how to become the brave person who can
hope to be fortunate.

NW: So how do you become lucky in that sense?

QS: This brings us to the moral heart of the book. What you need to
do is to cultivate the quality that Machiavelli calls virtù. He is
translating the Latin word virtus. Virtus is the quality of the vir. Vir
in Latin means ‘man’, but there are two words in Latin for ‘man’.
One is homo, which means man or woman, a member of human kind.
But the other is vir, denoting the manly man—the source of our word
‘virile’. Machiavelli is saying that, to get lucky, what you have to be
is that kind of man. The crucial notion is that of using virtù to master
Fortuna.

So, for Machiavelli the question is: how can you hope, by means
of manly qualities, to ally with Fortuna and even master her? His
answer is that ‘La Fortuna e una donna’, ‘Fortune is a woman.’ To
master her, you must always be bold; like a young man seeking to
conquer a woman (this is Machiavelli talking, not me). You must
never hold back but always take action. He makes the point most
explicitly in one of his late letters, presenting us with one of his best
epigrams: ‘it is always better to act and regret it than not to act and
regret it’.

NW: This ‘manliness’, it’s not just a matter of being somebody who acts.
You have to act in particular ways, surely.

QS: Yes, that’s right. There are two particular ways in which you
must act, and here Machiavelli begins to polemicize against his
classical authorities, and especially against the humanist
understanding of the proper conduct of princes. About these writers
he says that one thing they completely forget is that one key to
success in politics is always to have a reservoir of force, of pure
power, and be ready to use it. It’s certainly remarkable how much
that was not said in humanist political theory. For example,
Erasmus’ book of advice to Christian princes, written at almost
exactly the same time, is a pacifist tract. He says that if you have to
use force you would do better to give up being a prince altogether.
For Machiavelli, that’s the greatest heresy you could utter, as he
makes clear in chapters 12 to 14 of The Prince, in which he
demands that rulers should be military leaders as well. This was an
unusual demand to make at this period, in which the use of
professional mercenary armies had become the norm. But
Machiavelli is vehemently opposed to this policy, and always insists
that princes must also be commanders of their own citizen armies.

NW: But the force isn’t just directed outwards to potential threats from
other armies but inwardly as well within the state?

QS: That’s right. But you should try at all costs to avoid using force
against your own people. Instead you need to understand the second
way in which you ought to act, which involves understanding what
moral qualities are appropriate to a prince. The classical Roman
writers, Cicero and Seneca above all, had given a very strong
answer to that question. The first element of virtus in Seneca’s
account of princely rule is clementia, the quality of mercy. The
second is liberalitas or generosity—as we might still say, ‘princely’
generosity. But most of all, a true prince is said to be someone who
honours his word—who obeys fides, good faith. The pivotal moment
in The Prince comes when Machiavelli suddenly informs us in
chapter 15 that this entire account is wrong.

NW: It’s wrong because you should use what we would perhaps see as
devious means to achieve your ends.

QS: Yes, that’s part of it, but it’s wrong for two reasons, and one
has been very little noticed by Machiavelli’s commentators. One of
the things he believes is that it may well be true that liberality (to
which he turns in chapter 16) as well as clemency (which he
discusses in chapter 17) are the names of admirable virtues. But he
believes that we don’t understand those virtues. Princes who give
away huge sums of money think they are being liberal. They don’t
ask themselves where the money is coming from. But it’s necessarily
coming from the people, who have to be taxed heavily for such
princely liberality to be possible. But this, Machiavelli says, is not
true liberality: this is what he calls suntuosità, extravagance, which
is not a virtue but a vice, and will cause you to be hated instead of
admired.

Likewise with clemency: princes who value clemency think that
the virtue consists in always forgiving your enemies. But
Machiavelli thinks that the right way to be clement is to make an
example of your enemies to begin with, so that you can then be more
merciful later. He gives an example that would have shocked his
original readers, for he criticizes a great classical hero, the Roman
general Scipio, who was famous for having forgiven a mutiny. As a
result, Machiavelli retorts, a second mutiny followed. Machiavelli
insists that Scipio did not display true clemency, for his response
was troppo facile, too easy-going altogether. And again, that quality
is not a virtue but a vice, and one that will cause you to be viewed
with contempt instead of admired.

You are absolutely right, however, that what Machiavelli mainly
wants to say is that the ideal of the prince as someone who always
keeps his word, who never uses devious means, is what is most
profoundly mistaken. It is mistaken because the underlying ideal of
manliness according to Machiavelli is not enough. Here he again
turns against his Roman authorities. Cicero had laid it down in Book
I of De officiis that there are two ways in which injustice can be
done. One is by the use of force, the other by the use of fraud. Force,
Cicero says, reduces us to the level of the lion, fraud to the level of
the fox. They are beastly qualities, in other words, not manly ones,
and have no place in civilized life.

Machiavelli answers in a celebrated and satirical moment in
chapter 19 that, if you want to maintain your state, you will have to
be prepared to act in beastly as well as in manly ways. So you had
better learn which beasts to imitate. And those princes have done
best, Machiavelli declares, who have learned to imitate both the lion
and the fox. The classical ideal of manliness, in other words, is not
enough. Machiavelli’s hero among the Roman emperors is Septimius
Severus, of whom he says in chapter 21 that he behaved like a
ferocious lion and a very cunning fox, as a result of which he was
feared and respected by everyone.

NW: And the motivation for imitating these animals is that that’s what’s
most likely to get you the results you want?

QS: Exactly. Those are the qualities that will not only enable you to
maintain your state but to obtain the glory you should be seeking as
well. You should follow the manly virtues so far as possible, but you
should know how to be brutal and beastly when, as Machiavelli puts
it, this is dictated by necessity. So Machiavelli is telling the princes
of his age that they basically need to know, as he puts it, how to turn
and turn about, how to trim their sails to the winds of Fortune.
Sometimes it will be best to keep your word, sometimes not;
sometimes the virtues can be espoused, sometimes they will have to
be ignored.

It may sound as if Machiavelli is celebrating thuggery, and this
has often been said of him. But that, I think, is a mistake. In chapter 8
of The Prince he tells the story of Agathocles of Syracuse, of whom
he says that he only ever used brutal methods, and that this enabled
him successfully to maintain his state. But Machiavelli adds that by
these means Agathocles gained imperio ma non gloria —power but
not glory. The prince who aspires to achieve not just stability but
glory must know when it is best to be cruel, miserly, and deceitful,
but he must also know how to minimize the use of these vices, which
Machiavelli never hesitates to stigmatize as evil. A successful
prince will always try to be good, or at least try to seem good; it is
just that he must also know how to make use of bad methods if this is
necessary, as it often will be, for the maintenance of his state.

NW: Would it be fair to say that Machiavelli was a consequentialist, that
he judged acts on outcomes rather than the intentions with which they’re
performed?

QS: That’s exactly the right way to put it. He doesn’t express the
point as formally as you have done, but he certainly believes that you
must sometimes be willing to do evil in order that good shall come
of it. If the good in question is the preservation of your state and the
attainment of glory for yourself and your patria, then you must be
prepared to do anything to attain those ends.

NW: Which presumably means that this isn’t a philosophy for ordinary
people.

QS: That’s a very interesting point. That’s right; it is a philosophy
for princes, it’s for people who are leaders and it is probably not a
book that you and I are meant to read.

NW: But should our leaders read it? Is there something in Machiavelli
that our present-day leaders might learn from?

QS: Well, it depends on what you feel about consequentialist
ethical theories. If you believe that there are goals for societies
which are so important that they must be pursued at all costs, then
you are a Machiavellian. It would also be fair to say, I think, that
currently our rulers are in a Machiavellian mood. The basic
aspiration of the liberal state has been to guarantee security for its
citizens, and thereafter to leave them so far as possible to enjoy their
liberties. But the current threat of terrorism has led to the curtailing
of liberties, and also to the use of what many of us regard as immoral
means—especially torture—in the name of trying to preserve
security.

NW: So politicians are behaving in that respect in a Machiavellian way?

QS: Yes, that would be a fair way of putting it. They see the
overriding goal as that of preserving the state, and they are urging us
not to be too squeamish about the means that may be needed to
preserve it. And that is the core of Machiavelli’s political advice in
The Prince.
