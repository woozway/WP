Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Back

ROBERT ROWLAND SMITH ON
Jacques Derrida on Forgiveness

David Edmonds: There’s surely no figure from the twentieth century who
so divides philosophers. Some Anglo-American philosophers insist he was
a charlatan and claim his writings were intentionally obscure—there was a
huge fuss when Cambridge University decided to award him an honorary
doctorate. But Jacques Derrida also has numerous admirers and disciples.
Born into an Algerian Jewish family, Derrida moved to France in 1949
when he was 19. Over the next two decades, he began to develop a new
approach to philosophy— ‘Deconstruction’: his best-known book, Of
Grammatology was published in 1967. But here Derrida specialist Robert
Rowland Smith discusses a theme from another of his works, On
Cosmopolitanism and Forgiveness.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we’re going to focus on is Derrida on
forgiveness. Could you say a little about who Jacques Derrida was?
Robert Rowland Smith: Jacques Derrida was a French philosopher.
He was born in Algeria in 1930 and he died in the early part of the
twenty-first century. He came to Paris as a young man of 19 where he
studied at the École Normale Supérieure and ended up taking a
series of posts in Paris, ending with a position in the École des
Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales.

NW: He’s most associated with ‘deconstruction’.

RRS: That’s right. It’s a word that he inherited partly from
Heidegger. But I ought to clarify what Derrida meant by
deconstruction. There is a myth about Derrida that deconstruction is
a form of twentieth-century nihilism, that it suggests that there’s no
such thing as meaning, that everything is about text and language.
That’s a peculiar caricature of what Derrida’s work is about. I
would describe that version of his work—the version that was taken
up in the United States into literary criticism—as deconstructivism.
On the other side, I’d put something—which we’ll call
deconstruction—which encapsulates many more things, including
work on language, and also work on forgiveness and other matters.

NW: So what did Derrida say about forgiveness?

RRS: His starting point was to observe that the rhetoric of
forgiveness was becoming all the more prominent in the world as
politicians queued up to ask for forgiveness for various crimes
they’d committed: crimes committed either in their own name or by
other people. So, his starting point is a political one. What he wants
to get to, though, is a notion that forgiveness is not as straightforward
as we might think it is—and that, in a certain sense, forgiveness is
impossible. That is a peculiar thing to say because we forgive
people every day. If you were to steal some money from me, Nigel, I
would probably forgive you depending on how much it was and how
quickly you returned it. But it’s not something that feels to me an
impossible thing to do; on the contrary, it’s something that I could do
on an everyday basis.

NW: That’s good to know. Forgiveness though doesn’t seem to be at all
paradoxical. It’s one person acknowledging that they’d been wronged and
saying, ‘I’m going to wipe the slate clean.’

RRS: That’s right. At one level, it seems pretty straightforward. But
what Derrida says is that if I can forgive you for stealing that tenner
from me, in a sense it was pretty easy. You were forgivable, and
Derrida then smells a rat. If it is possible to forgive you, it means
you were forgivable. So why did it need me to forgive you for it?
Why will I have to be involved in the forgiving?

NW: But lots of things are edible though they haven’t yet been eaten. So
doesn’t it make sense to say something is forgivable but hasn’t yet been
forgiven? I don’t see why just because something’s forgivable there’s no 
sense in forgiving someone.

RRS: Derrida is not necessarily talking about what happens over
time; rather, he’s interested in the conditions that apply when we
forgive or don’t forgive other people. He’s saying that for us to
forgive somebody, it must be possible for them to be forgiven. But if
it is possible for them to be forgiven, why would we need to forgive
them in the first place? What they’re doing is de facto forgivable.
So, there’s no real value that attaches to the forgiveness that I might
grant to you. And that leads him to pose the alternative side of the
equation, which is to say that actually it’s only the unforgivable
which really calls for forgiveness. It’s those things which are so
criminal, so heinous, so atrocious that activate the need—the moral
need, even the political need—to do something about them. But, of
course, once that need is activated, we cannot do anything with it,
because to forgive the unforgivable is by its very nature impossible.
We’re caught in a double bind between forgiveness and the
impossibility of forgiveness.

NW: It seems to me that there are degrees of difficulty in terms of
forgiving things. If I steal fifty pence from you, you’ll forgive me. If I steal
£50,000 from you, you may find it harder to forgive. If I murder your
family, that’s harder to forgive still. If I wipe out a whole race, that’s even
harder to forgive. They’re all forgivable in principle; they are not
unforgivable.

RRS: That’s a good challenge. One of the philosophers that Derrida
reads in turn in his book on Forgiveness is a man called Jankélévitch
who says that forgiveness died in Auschwitz. It was impossible,
essentially, to be in a position of forgivability after the crimes
committed in the Holocaust. So, there is a degree of truth in what you
say.

Derrida would counter as follows: actually two things come into
play when you forgive either something trivial or something
relatively serious. On the one hand, it’s possible to forgive you and I
do forgive you whether you’ve stolen that money from me or done
something worse. But, at the same time, my act of forgiveness
always has to refer to an unconditional unforgivability, otherwise it
debases and devalues the forgiveness that I’m currently acting out in
front of you. So, he says it’s not so much a question of being on the
spectrum between A and Z, as evoking or convoking those two
conditions at the same time. So, I forgive you and it’s possible to do
that, but it’s always with a view to another horizon which is the
unforgivability of whatever you might do.

NW: Within Christian ethics, if I’ve understood it correctly, almost
everything is forgivable. So what is it that we could have a difficulty about
forgiving here?

RRS: Derrida talks about the relationship to Christian forgiveness.
He says that in Christian forgiveness you are always forgiving the
person as well as the act. Once you’ve forgiven the person, you are
implicitly placing a condition upon them, and the condition is: ‘I will
forgive you so long as you repent or change or reform in some way.’
So the tendency in Christian thinking is to attach conditions to
forgiveness, implicitly, to be sure—but they’re there. So, when you
forgive, you will only ever forgive the person who will change.
Whereas Derrida is saying that true forgiveness, if it’s about
forgiving the unforgivable, doesn’t impose that condition. It says,
‘I forgive you even though you have committed this terrible thing and
you may continue to commit this terrible thing and will possibly
commit it again and again in the future.’

NW: I don’t think that’s true because lots of people say that they forgive
the dead. I forgive my father for being horrible to me. But he’s dead now;
he’s not going to change.

RRS: He is not going to change, but what you will have done is
internally transform your image of your father into somebody who is
now forgivable. So, you have worked the transformation on him to
render him forgivable in your own mind’s eye, and therefore you
have subtly managed a kind of christianization—I use that term with
a small ‘c’—upon your father to make it manageable for the two of
you to come to this agreement across the line of death.

NW: So let’s try and get Derrida’s paradox clear. Derrida is saying that
if you forgive something which is intrinsically forgivable, that’s not a great
deed. The great deed is to forgive what is by definition unforgivable, but
that’s impossible. So, therefore, the only thing worth forgiving is the very
thing which you can’t forgive.

RRS: Correct. Derrida has a philosophical point which he couples
with that insight. The practical point is forgiveness and
unforgivability go together. The philosophical point is that
forgiveness requires two contradictory conditions to be met. On the
one hand, that the act is unforgivable, but on the other that it has to be
forgivable for it to take place at all.

NW: Presumably then, ordinary acts of forgiveness become of lesser
value than they have been previously. Once you read Derrida you’re going
to be saying, ‘I was forgiven, but that was easy for the forgiver.’

RRS: That’s a good challenge again, and I think that there are two
responses. The first is that there is a call on your conscience that
Derrida wants to raise. When you forgive someone, be a bit more
self-conscious about whether it’s a difficult or an easy act for you. If
it’s easy, then you will be seeking to gain some kind of emotional or
political capital out of it. So, that’s the first rather practical point.

The second point is even in relatively trivial instances of
forgiveness—you accidentally spill your glass of water on me and I
forgive you—forgiveness always evokes in some subtle or minimal
way that larger horizon of unforgivability at the same time too. So,
forgiveness, by its very nature, has to occur as if there were the
unforgivable on the scene at the same time.

NW: Derrida was the bugbear of Anglo-American philosophers,
particularly in the analytic tradition. They got very angry with him, tried
to prevent him getting an honorary degree at Cambridge, wrote abusive
things about him. Why does he stir up so much disgruntlement amongst
philosophers?

RRS: That’s a good question. He’s not been the most popular
character among people in that tradition. Incidentally, he was
awarded the Cambridge degree in the end after quite a lot of debate
(in 1992, but an honorary degree in Literature, not in Philosophy).

Why the hostility? I don’t think it’s mischievousness on his part,
but he does try and pull the rug from under the feet of the
philosophical tradition by exposing what he sees as a number of
prejudices in it. For example, there are prejudices towards reason as
something that is intrinsically non-contradictory. Why should that be
the case? Why should reason be something that isn’t prone to its own
particular tics and prejudices and so on? So, one of his main
concerns is to think about the history of reason as such—and to show
that, like the history of anything else, it is subject to infiltration, to
personal preference, to politics, and so on. So, there’s no neutral
history of reason, there’s no neutral rationality. And he talks about
different rationalities, psychoanalytic rationalities, for example, as
well as so-called logical rationalities. I think the project is more
about putting things into perspective rather than disrupting things per
se.

NW: The way you describe Derrida, he sounds very much in the Socratic
tradition. The tradition of Socrates playing the gadfly, irritating people by
asking the questions they don’t want to, or can’t answer …

RRS: Derrida would be delighted with the analogy. In one of his
books—on Socrates and Freud—he talks about this movement from
behind, coming to surprise people when they’re least expecting it.
So, you draw a pretty good analogy: he’s Socratic in that sense. The
main difference is that the values that he espouses are not necessarily
Socratic values.

NW: You knew Derrida personally. Was he in any way affected by the
opposition that he encountered from Anglo-American philosophers?

RRS: Yes. But there are equal and opposite forces in play. For
every hostile analytic philosopher from the US west or east coast
there was at least one aficionado from somewhere in mittel-Europa.

NW: A lot of Derrida’ s writing is extremely difficult to understand and,
to outsiders at least, it’s quite dry. Is that what he was like as a man?

RRS: First of all, there’s a huge range of writings of Derrida, some
of it pretty playful. I don’t know how many volumes it will come to
when the collected edition comes out, but I imagine it would be in
the fifties or sixties, and within that there’s a huge spectrum, from the
more obscure to the more transparent. What was he like as a man?
Extremely engaging, an affectionate, witty man. I remember picking
him up from Heathrow airport, when he came over to deliver the
Oxford Amnesty Lectures on human rights. Being a Frenchman, he
tried to get into the driving position, I tried to shift him over to the
other side and he said, ‘typical, I’m obsessed with rights’—an off-
the-cuff remark in English, and very witty.

NW: So, do you think he forgave the Anglo-American philosophers?

RRS: I think that would be impossible.
