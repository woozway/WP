Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Back

AARON RIDLEY ON
Friedrich Nietzsche on Art and Truth

David Edmonds: Does art teach us truths, and is that its purpose?
Friedrich Nietzsche was, by critical consensus, a tin-eared composer—and
by universal consensus, a virtuoso writer. Nietzsche took art seriously.
Until they had a massive falling out, he was a close friend of Richard
W agner. For Nietzsche, the function of art—of music and theatre—was to
give us a hint of a truth—the truth that the world was chaotic and
meaningless; but equally, art had to shield us from this dreadful reality.
Aaron Ridley is a Nietzschean scholar at the University of Southampton.

Nigel Warburton: We’re going to focus on Nietzsche’s ideas about art and
truth. Could you say a little bit about Nietzsche’s relationship to art?

Aaron Ridley: Nietzsche was arguably the most art-obsessed
philosopher there’s been. Throughout his life he regarded himself as
a serious poet; he also regarded himself as a serious composer,
though the evidence of his own compositions was to the contrary. He
assigned a very significant place to art.

NW: In his first book, The Birth of Tragedy, he focused on the art of
tragedy, but it illuminated other things about art and truth.

AR: Nietzsche wrote The Birth of Tragedy under the spell of
Schopenhauer who had thought that the world was an utterly vile and
ghastly place, and if one really grasped the nature of it, one would
see that the whole thing, that existence itself, was a terrible mistake.
Nietzsche took that thought over from Schopenhauer in a way. But
where Schopenhauer thought that that was a good reason for
renouncing everything and saying no to the world, no to existence,
Nietzsche thought that the ancient Greeks had found a way of using
the truth that the basic nature of existence is awful to make their
culture more energetic—and that they had done so through tragic art.
He held that the flourishing of Athenian culture was a function of
this. Through their tragedy, the Athenians allowed themselves to get
just enough of a hint of the dark irrational forces that the world really
consisted in, while saving themselves from the full impact that the
recognition of that would have, by laying over it a veil of illusion.
So you got a glimpse of the truth, but the truth was made palatable,
the pill sweetened by a structure of illusions. That was what was
characteristic about their tragedy. You need the truth to energize
itself, the well-springs of the life-force are irrational through and
through—but then you need the illusion that art also provides to
prevent the energy from blowing you apart.

NW: He expressed that through the notion of the Apollonian and the
Dionysian.

AR: Yes, he uses these two god figures to personify various
metaphysical levels. The reality, which he associates with the god
Dionysus, is that the world is ultimately chaos and destruction and
meaningless striving. Illusion, surface appearance, the stuff we lay
over the Dionysian reality to protect ourselves from it, he associates
with the god Apollo. He thought that in classical Greek tragedy some
absolutely ingenious balance between letting in the Dionysian truth
and making it palatable via the Apollonian illusion had been
achieved, and that this was the unique achievement of classical
Greek tragedy.

NW: Then in came Socrates and upset that.

AR: Then in came Socrates and brought about the death of tragedy.
Nietzsche’s The Birth of Tragedy is in fact largely devoted to the
death of tragedy and to explaining how, in his view, a very different
world view gets put into place—a world view that he associates
with the figure of Socrates—where the irrational is ultimately
regarded as unreal. So, what Nietzsche had taken the Greeks’ insight
to be, that the fundamental nature of the world is chaotic and
irrational, and so on, was, from the Socratic perspective,
impossible. There could be no such world as that because in the
Socratic world view there was an equation between reason and
reality—and, indeed, goodness.

So, from Nietzsche’s point of view, what happens is that a certain
version of the Apollonian which had previously just been regarded
as an illusion which hid reality from you, becomes reality. And if
you start to think of the world like that, in Nietzsche’s view, tragedy
can no longer do the work that it did—since, on this picture, there is
no longer any Dionysian reality to get a glimpse of or indeed to
protect yourself from.

NW: But, surely, Nietzsche himself believed the Dionysian was an
important force in the world. He didn’t accept the Socratic picture.

AR: That’s exactly right. Nietzsche thought that Schopenhauer and
the Greeks had been on to something, that in its innermost nature the
world was chaotic and dreadful, and that the pre-Socratic Greeks
had found a way of drawing strength from that, through their
tragedies. Whereas post-Socrates, that sort of reality got denied and,
in Nietzsche’s view, everything got thinner, robbed of a fundamental
primal energy that was stolen along with Dionysus.

The end of The Birth of Tragedy was actually about the rebirth of
tragedy or the possibility of the rebirth of tragedy. He thinks that now
—he was obviously writing in the late nineteenth century, but ‘now’
means modernity in general—it might be possible to have this kind
of culture-sustaining art again. The reason for that is that the Socratic
world view, which led in one way or the other to the Christian world
view, is beginning to lose its grip on us. So if the Socratic/Christian
picture starts to be chipped away, then the Dionysian is on offer
again, and we ought in principle to be able to bring off that
incredible balance between glimpsing the Dionysian truth, while at
the same time making life livable through the illusions of Apollo.

NW: So in that phase of his writing, Nietzsche was certainly treating art
as something which made life livable: if we saw the world as it really is we
wouldn’t be able to carry on.

AR: In Nietzsche’s view, that’s certainly the case. The world is just
a meaningless procession of becoming and destruction: there’s no
sense to it, there’s no pattern to it, there’s no reason to it. Moreover,
and this is something he also took over from Schopenhauer, if that’s
the correct understanding of reality, then individuality itself—the
individuality of particular people, particular things, particular
objects—that’s a kind of illusion, too, part of the Apollonian world.
What are we? We’re just the froth on a maelstrom of waves breaking
for no reason on to nothing. Getting that picture, Nietzsche thinks, is
energizing, but too much of it and it’s psychologically utterly
destructive. ‘There is no me: all I am is a random confluence of
currents and splashes and thunderings, here for a few moments and
that’s that: there’s no point to any of it!’

So, he thinks that, from the point of view of our individual
existence, if we were to come into being aware of ourselves as the
illusory individuals that we really are, then the very best thing for us
would be never to have been born at all, and the second best thing
would be to die soon. If you really were to get a clear take on the
illusoriness of your own individuality, then you could only think of
your life as being a mistake. So you need some illusions to protect
yourself from that. Again, the Apollonian steps in to save the day, to
reinforce or rescue our sense of ourselves as properly individual
beings.

NW: What you’re saying is that for Nietzsche, in this early phase, the
arts served to give us the illusion that gives shape and coherence to
something which is ultimately just flux.

AR: Exactly that. What the Apollonian is doing is peddling a kind
of untruth in order to protect us from the truth, and it can do that in a
number of different ways. Some of the Apollonian devices here are
things like having recognizable characters with coherent motives,
who act in a way that we can recognize people as doing. But this, of
course, is Apollonian because the fact of the matter is that it’s all just
strife and chaos. Then, by giving us a plot which is intelligible and
characters who interact with each other in intelligible ways and a
story that unfolds with that famous inevitability that tragedy is meant
to have, again, all that this is doing is reinforcing a certain set of
illusions to the effect that life makes sense.

NW: How did Nietzsche’s views about art change as he grew older?

AR: There was a very seismic change shortly after he wrote The
Birth of Tragedy. I said that the last sections of The Birth of
Tragedy held out the promise that there might be a rebirth of tragedy.
At the time that he was writing the book, he thought this was going on
in the music dramas of Richard Wagner for whom Nietzsche was a
very willing propagandist—indeed, possibly the most able
propagandist any artist has ever had. The Birth of Tragedy is in part
a song of praise to Wagner: here it is! For the first time since
Aeschylus, we’ve actually got proper art, doing the sort of thing that
art ought to be doing.

But very shortly after writing The Birth of Tragedy, he fell out
with Wagner. He became utterly disenchanted and decided that what
he had thought was a great reborn tragic art form, was in fact
everything that he hated most about Christianity—only in disguise. I
think he was absolutely wrong about Wagner, but that’s neither here
nor there. Nietzsche became very committed to that view. And it’s no
coincidence that the minute that he decided that Wagner was a
charlatan and not the saviour of modern culture after all, art is
massively downgraded for a few years in his pantheon of important
things.

NW: How had his views about truth changed?

AR: Well, at much the same time that he became convinced that
Wagner was a charlatan, he also became convinced that
Schopenhauer was also an enemy of everything that was good, too.
This was Nietzsche having his oedipal moment, growing up and
wanting space—and doing it in the classic way, by rebelling against
his intellectual mentors. But once he had decided that Schopenhauer
was also really bad news, that made him very sceptical about the
Schopenhauerian metaphysics which had underpinned what he was
doing in The Birth of Tragedy. It’s curious what survived. He comes
away from him, even once he’s repudiated him, thinking that the
world is chaotic, that the world lacks meaning, but no longer thinking
that this was a deep metaphysical point—a point to the effect that, if
we see behind the appearances, then we’ll see that everything is just
turmoil and nonsense.

He now thinks, for a short period in the late 1870s, that the best
route we’ve got to the truth is science, and that what science shows
is that our ordinary take on the empirical world is hopelessly
inadequate: compared to that take, he says the world is indeed a
veritable mish-mash. But, because science allows us a better
apprehension of what the empirical facts actually are, it also holds
out the prospect that we might, through that knowledge, attempt to
make the world a straightforwardly better place. However, he
thought that a lot of the things we’d uncover during the process of
becoming more knowledgeable about the truth would be very
disturbing. So from that point of view, he thought that, although
ultimately we ought to be able to do without art—art as the provision
of illusions—and, indeed, although we will come to do without art,
once we’ve got used to the truth and have steeled ourselves in the
appropriate ways against it, nevertheless, for the time being, during
the period of transition, we’d still hang on to art: art still has a
protective role to play as we gradually uncover the truth about things
through science.

NW: You said that this was a short-lived phase. What happened next?

AR: Well, he realized it had nothing to do with him, that he’d spent
a couple of years being somebody else! A very good symptom of this
is that one of the things that that we’d be able to do as we became
more knowledgeable would be progressively to abolish suffering,
and moreover that that would be a thoroughly good thing. This is
possibly the most un-Nietzschean thought that Nietzsche ever had. In
The Birth of Tragedy, he thinks that glimpsing the horrible reality of
things and suffering from the illusoriness of one’s own individual
existence can make one stronger and more vibrant—so, suffering is
good for you.

And he reverts to this view: he returns again and again and ever
more vehemently to the thought that there’s something actually
valuable about at least some suffering. So, the attempt to abolish
suffering altogether as a way of making life better, Nietzsche went
back to thinking, is in fact a classic expression of a life that no
longer has the energy for itself, of a life that is declining into
complacent uninterestingness.

NW: The way in which art shapes an apparently formless reality was also
mirrored in what he said about how we might approach our own lives.

AR: That’s right, yes. Once he’s come out of the positivist period,
he still thinks that the world is inherently chaotic, indifferent to
human purposes and human needs. It’s a meaningless world, and this
presents us with some challenges particularly if we don’t want to
avail ourselves of some of the more obvious ways we might have of
dealing with apparent senselessness. One way would be the
Socratic/Christian way, according to Nietzsche, which would be to
say that this meaninglessness is only apparent; and that if one looks
hard enough and thinks hard enough one will see that actually it’s all
for the good, it’s all for the best in the best of all possible worlds
(where the best is a world that in fact transcends this one). Nietzsche
thinks that that’s a fantasy—a dangerous fantasy, that we should have
learned to do without.

In effect, what we’re left with, for Nietzsche, is a chaotic,
meaningless world but not one in a deep Schopenhauerian sense, just
in a straightforward, immediate, and direct sense, which we ought to
know better than to try to make palatable to ourselves by telling
wholesale, big lies about it in the way that he thinks that Socrates
told just big lies and Christianity tells big lies. What we have to do,
instead, he thinks, is to tell little lies, lies that don’t falsify the entire
character of existence but which locally have the effect of making
portions of existence bearable. He thought we can do that by the way
in which we think about the world that we live in. But also, as you
say, we can do it by making something of an illusion of ourselves—
by, as he famously puts it, giving style to our character. The idea is
that we might become works of art, that we might improve ourselves
through a certain self-directed artistry.

NW: You’ve given a description of an interpretation of Nietzsche’s
different views about art and truth. But where do you think he was right
about the relationship, or are his views just of historical interest?

AR: It’s more than of just historical interest. What’s unusual about
Nietzsche’s position about art is the consistent thought that art is
something which trades in illusions, in deceptions, in partial visions
—and, indeed, that that’s a lot of its point. This is a very unorthodox
position in the history of thinking about art and particularly in the
history of thinking about the relationship between art and truth. What
almost all philosophers have wanted to do is say that art is a good
thing, and that it’s a good thing partly because it has some connection
to knowledge, which is valuable for us. That’s been the dominant
trend—the attempt which can often seem pompous and unconvincing,
to defend our investment in art by equipping it with high-minded
epistemic purposes. But this is a defence which, although very, very
common, is something we might want to look at with a certain
amount of suspicion. So I don’t think that the study of Nietzsche is of
merely historical interest. He offers us a richer and more challenging
conception of the relation between art and truth than any other
philosopher has done, and it is a conception that we have yet to
come properly to grips with. How much do we want to know about
ourselves and our world? How much would it be good for us to
know? These are the unfamiliar questions that Nietzsche’s
philosophy of art forces us to ask.
