Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Back

RICHARD REEVES ON
John Stuart Mill’s On Liberty

David Edmonds: John Stuart Mill was given an upbringing by his father
so demanding, so arduous, so rigid, that many blame it for his subsequent
mental breakdown. By age three, he was learning Latin and Greek.
Economics, geometry, and logic soon followed. His father, James Mill, was
a friend and disciple of the utilitarian Jeremy Bentham and a notable
philosopher and economist in his own right. John Stuart Mill was a sort of
laboratory test; an experiment in raising a utilitarian child. To a degree, it
worked. John Stuart went on to become a Member of Parliament and a
brilliant philosopher and economist. He was an early advocate of women’ s
rights and was the architect of modern liberalism. He eventually found
personal happiness through his long friendship and subsequent marriage
to Harriet Taylor. Richard Reeves has written a biography of Mill and so is
well placed to link Mill’s ideas to his highly unusual life.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we’re focusing on is John Stuart Mill’s great
book, On Liberty. That book was described by him as a ‘philosophic
textbook of a single truth’. What was that truth?

Richard Reeves: On Liberty is fascinating both because it’s the
best short version of his philosophy but it’s also revealing about his
life. People generally know about the Harm Principle—that you
should be free to do what you wish as long as you don’t harm others;
they tend to think that that’s the single truth he was referring to. But
actually the single truth at the heart of On Liberty is that each
individual should be free to develop to the fullest of their own
potential. That’s what On Liberty is about: it’s about individual
flourishing. The Harm Principle is a part of his liberalism, but it’s
not the essence of his liberalism.

NW: I don’t know if this is too crude a reading, but he had a very
constrained childhood: could you see On Liberty as a reaction to that?

RR: Mill’s intellectual journey, which culminates in On Liberty,
results from the fact that he felt the need to prove that he was self-
made. He was described as a ‘made man’, as ‘manufactured’ by his
father James Mill and Jeremy Bentham who set out to create a
utilitarian disciple, somebody who was going to take forward the
philosophy of utilitarianism—the doctrine of the greatest happiness
of the greatest number. So it’s important for Mill to believe that he’s
made himself: he wants to show, ‘I wasn’t made by my father and
Jeremy Bentham. I made me.’ But this then becomes the beating heart
of his liberalism and his philosophy: that this should be true for
every single man and woman.

NW: In On Liberty he sets out the broad conditions under which people
could flourish in that way?

RR: That’s right; it’s a description of a good liberal life, but also of
a liberal culture and the society within which you’ll be able to live
out your life to the full. So, there are rules, the most famous being the
Harm Principle, that is, other things being equal, as long as you’re
not harming me, you should be free to do what you want to, even if
it’s a stupid and self-destructive thing to do. The freedom to fail, the
freedom to engage in activities which others would consider to be
immoral or reprehensible or just silly is very important to
liberalism. In addition, there needs to be a set of liberal institutions,
assumptions about tolerance, and so on, and a belief in the
possibility that each individual can become a better version of him
or herself. That’s the optimism at the heart of his liberalism: that we
can become better versions of ourselves.

NW: But it’s not just about the legal institutions: he was very strongly
opposed to what he called ‘the tyranny of the majority’.

RR: Mill famously said: ‘Protection against the tyranny of the
magistrate is not enough: you also need protection against the tyranny
of public opinion.’ He called it ‘the despotism of custom’: we do
things because other people are doing it. He said that someone who
chooses to do something merely because it’s the custom makes no
choice at all. It is very important to him that we are actually
following our own path and that we aren’t being driven by what we
now might call ‘the done thing’.

Much of the force of his argument is to do with intellectual
freedom. He was explicit that On Liberty is not about political
freedom (we tend today to still treat it in that way). There will be
arguments about ‘should the government ban gambling?’, ‘should the
government make us eat better food?’, etc. But what animates Mill is
intellectual and moral liberty, whether or not we are living in an
environment and have the capabilities to construct a life of our own
choosing.

NW: But in the area of free speech, is he not using a political argument?
Provided nobody is harmed, people should be free to express opinions,
because that’s the best way to arrive at the truth.

RR: What he’s arguing for in On Liberty is not merely the absence
of restraint on free speech: he’s advocating dissent, and argument
and disagreement. Indeed, he says that if there isn’t an opposing
view, we should conjure one up. He says that even the Catholic
Church appoints a devil’s advocate to argue against someone being
canonized as a saint, and we should do the same thing. Because there
is nothing more dangerous than ‘the deep slumber of a decided
opinion’, in Mill’s words. He would be very unhappy with a society
in which we had the formal legal freedom of free speech, but
everybody just went around agreeing with each other. He positively
wants argument, positively wants dissent, and he believes that’s
necessary because it’s in the collision of the half-truths which
constitute most of our opinions, that the real truth will emerge.

He said, very famously in Parliament, ‘Each of us knows that
some of our opinions are wrong, and none of us know which they
are. For if we did, they would not be our opinions.’ He hated
politicians who said, ‘I will never change my mind’, ‘I’m right’, and
so on. Of course, he was passionate in his own convictions. But if
we ever give up the possibility that what we believe is right is
actually wrong, then we’re in real trouble. The formal structures of
liberalism are only a very small part of his liberalism. He’s actually
arguing for something much more demanding.

NW: It’s demanding of individuals, but not so much of society.

RR: It’s demanding of both. Mill is not only asking us to criticize
ourselves but to hold each other to account, and for there to be a
constant scrutiny. That was quite difficult for a lot of his readers.
There is a lovely moment in Thomas Hardy who was a big fan of
Mill’s. In his novel, Jude the Obscure, one of the characters, Sue
Bridehead, reads Mill and she says to her husband, ‘W e must
constantly be choosing our own opinions; these are John Stuart
Mill’s words. Why can’t you act upon them? I always wish to.’ And
her husband, Richard Phillotson, says, ‘What do I care about J. S.
Mill? I only want to lead a quiet life.’

What’s lovely about that is you can imagine Hardy’s reader going,
‘That’s right. Does John really want us to be questioning everything?
I too only want a quiet life.’ Of course, for Mill, that sort of quiet
life, the deep slumber of decided opinion where we stop questioning
ourselves and each other, that’s when things get dangerous. That’s
exactly the point at which liberalism is under threat.

NW: There’s a slight irony, as well, in that she’s citing Mill as if he were
an authority, whereas presumably he doesn’t want to set himself up as the
absolute authority: he might be fallible on liberalism as much as anything
else.

RR: One of the tensions in his work is how one handles authority.
Actually, he wanted the more learned and cleverer people to be
more influential than the uneducated mass, and he was famously
worried about universal suffrage, until levels of education had risen.
But, on the other hand, he did actually explicitly accept on various
occasions that he was wrong about some things; he changed his
mind, for example, on one of the tenets of his economics. He was
immediately converted to proportional representation by what he
considered to be a killer set of arguments by Thomas Hare.

So, he has the authority of someone who’s thought very hard about
a subject, and is willing to state ‘here’s what I think is the truth’. But
when a counterargument is made and he thinks it’s sufficiently strong,
he himself was willing to change his mind. In a sense, the danger of
Mill—and you can see it happening already in Hardy—is that he’s
becoming a national treasure: everybody wants to quote him; he’s a
fairly safe establishment figure from our liberal past. So he’s lost
some of the dangerousness that is essential to his liberalism.

NW: It’s true that some people carry around copies of On Liberty and
read it as if it were a religious book.

RR: It was actually described by a lot of his contemporaries as
having a feel of a gospel. And it certainly retains some sense of
being a New Testament of liberalism, because it’s short and well
written, and polemical, and because it can be reread by each
generation in a different way. As a work of political theory and of
philosophy, it retains much more authority than most. In fact, the
former leader of the liberal party, Joe Grimond, was asked, ‘How do
you keep your liberalism alive?’ He said, ‘Every New Year’s day I
reread On Liberty.’

NW: On Liberty was first published in 1859. Can you give us a sense of
the climate of that time?

RR: One of the paradoxes of On Liberty is that its strongest
arguments are against the tyranny of public opinion: Mill was
worried that mass communication, mass media, mass travel,
universal suffrage, would create the way things are thought about and
done. He was afraid that individualism, eccentricity, being heretical,
would become more difficult. But he defended On Liberty as being
less about his own era than about the future. His book was published
in the same year as Darwin’s Origin of Species; the Liberal Party
was born that year too, and this was a period of great intellectual
openness and flowering. So, in a sense, On Liberty sits uneasily in
its own historical context.

One of the reasons why On Liberty has survived so well is that,
whereas some of the legal arguments and the institutional arguments
resonated well with his own era, his arguments about what it means
to live a free life and to make and remake your own opinions and to
construct your own life are more relevant at the beginning of the
twenty-first century than they were when he actually wrote On
Liberty.

NW: In the book, Mill gives a great deal of credit to Harriet Taylor. If
you believe Mill, she was the co-author of his book. Is that a substantiated
claim or was it an act of generosity on his part?

RR: Mill made exaggerated claims for the intellectual influence of
Harriet Taylor because he was deeply in love with her. She was his
controversial companion for many years, and then later his wife. It’s
clear that they worked together intellectually and that she had some
influence on him. But the essence of his liberalism was born before
she became a serious intellectual collaborator. On Liberty was sent
to the publisher a matter of weeks after Harriet Taylor’s death; it had
been written before her death. There’s a physical memorial to her in
the cemetery just outside Avignon, but this was the literary
memorial, this was his way of thanking Harriet.

NW: You’ve devoted quite a lot of time to reading and rereading Mill and
putting his work in the context of his life. What have you taken away from
that?

RR: What Mill gives us is a way to think about many contemporary
social problems, which in many cases were social problems then, as
well. But, in On Liberty, Mill explicitly addresses such questions
as: ‘How does one regulate alcohol consumption?’; ‘What about
gambling?’; ‘What about prostitution?’ He didn’t tackle obesity
because it wasn’t an issue then: but I’m sure he would if he were
writing about it now. He also gives us a framework for free speech
laws, and so on. So he gives us a way to think about the rules, the
institutions that surround a liberal society. The Harm Principle, and
the free speech rules that he set out, remain as good a place as any to
begin discussions about the regulation or otherwise of personal
behaviour.

Mill gives us something else too. He gives us a picture of how to
live and what constitutes a good life. This resonates even more
strongly now than it did then. He argues that the only good worthy of
the name is that of a life which is led by the individual themself, a
scrutinized, autonomous life. To the extent that my life is a good one,
it’s one that I have chosen: I am deciding what constitutes a
flourishing life and I am pursuing my definition of the good life.
What makes Mill’s liberalism so muscular is his view that I am the
expert on what constitutes a good life for me, and that’s the basis
upon which both good lives and good societies are built. It is not for
the state or for the church, or for any other set of institutions, or for
the majority in their public opinion to dictate to me what constitutes
a good life. A good life is an autonomous life, and that is a message
which resonates across the world today as strongly as it did then.
This message should be informing not only our politics but also our
personal reflection to this day.
