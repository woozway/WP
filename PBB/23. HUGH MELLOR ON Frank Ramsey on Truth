Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Back

HUGH MELLOR ON
Frank Ramsey on Truth

David Edmonds: Who was the greatest Cambridge philosopher of the
twentieth century? Wittgenstein? Bertrand Russell? G. E. Moore? Hugh
Mellor, emeritus professor at Cambridge, wants to nominate a figure
virtually unknown outside academia: Frank Ramsey. Ramsey, the son of a
mathematician, himself became a mathematician, though his awesome
intellectual talents were applied to many areas: he learnt German in next
to no time, and translated Wittgenstein’s famous book, the Tractatus
Logico-Philosophicus, when he was just 19. He died seven years later, at
the peak of his powers. His brother, Michael, who became the 100th
Archbishop of Canterbury, said Frank ‘was interested in almost
everything’.

Nigel Warburton: We’re going to focus on Frank Ramsey on truth. Could
you say something about who Frank Ramsey was?

Hugh Mellor: Frank Ramsey was born in 1903, the son of a
mathematics don at Cambridge. He got to know quite a lot of
mathematicians, philosophers, and economists in Cambridge—
contemporaries of his. Then he studied Maths at Trinity College,
Cambridge, and graduated in 1923 with the top First in the subject—
he was a brilliant mathematician. He won a research fellowship at
King’s College a year later, and became a University lecturer in
mathematics in 1926. That was the post he held until he died, just
before his 27th birthday in 1930, which makes it all the more
remarkable how many other things he did in that very short life.

NW: What else did he do?

HM: He founded a branch of mathematics which is now called
‘Ramsey Theory’—don’t ask me to explain it, I don’t understand it.
He founded two branches of economics—Keynes asked him to write
articles in the Economics Journal. One is a theory of savings, the
study of how much of its income a nation should save, and the other
is a theory of optimal taxation, that is, if you need to raise a given
amount of revenue in tax, how should you do that while minimizing
the loss of utility to the people who are paying the taxes? Then he
wrote an article which is the foundation of modern subjective
decision theory. To do this all before he was 27 just shows what a
waste it is he died then.

NW: Why did he die so young?

HM: He developed the symptoms of jaundice, but it was
misdiagnosed as gallstones. In fact, he had hepatitis, and the
combination of hepatitis and being operated on for gallstones killed
him.

NW: We’re going to focus on his work on truth. In general terms, what
did he say about truth?

HM: His work on truth is an important part of what he did most of
—even though he was a lecturer in mathematics—which was work
on all sorts of aspects of philosophy. On truth he developed a theory
which has become famous—or notorious, depending whether you
like it or not—which is often now called the Redundancy Theory.
Most people who wrote about truth thought you needed a theory of
what truth is, just as you might need a theory of what stars are, for
example, so that you know what you’re talking about. But Ramsey’s
view was that you don’t need a theory of truth: the concept, he said,
is really redundant. He gave as an example: ‘If you say “it’s true that
Caesar was murdered” that just means “Caesar was murdered”.’ The
concept of truth here is redundant.

NW: Does that mean he didn’t have any time for people who ask ‘what is
truth?’

HM: It’s true that he wouldn’t have been very impressed by Pilate’s
question. He thought what was more important was to answer the
question of what it is to believe one truth rather than another—
what’s the difference between different truths? What’s the difference
between kinds of truth: for example, between mathematical truths on
the one hand, and scientific ones on the other?

NW: So, he’s a kind of zoologist of truth in the sense that he’s looking to
identify all the different species of truth.

HM: That’s right, and he’s also interested in why truth matters.
Why, in other words, if you’re going to have a belief about
something it’s a good idea to have a true one.

NW: One area in which people talk a lot about truth is mathematics.
Truths of mathematics seem to be necessarily true. What did he say about
mathematical truth?

HM: He was in Cambridge at the same time as Bertrand Russell,
after Russell and A. N. Whitehead had written Principia
Mathematica, their famous work on the foundations of mathematics,
in the 1910s. Their view of mathematics was that it consisted of
propositions which were completely general, not about any one thing
or kind of thing in particular, but all kinds of things. Ramsey thought
that wasn’t enough. Take a proposition like ‘any two things differ in
at least 30 ways’, which is completely general and, he said, might
well be true. But, even if it is true, it isn’t mathematics because it
could be false. So he tried to plug this gap by taking over from
Ludwig Wittgenstein’s Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus the idea that
a necessary truth, or a logical truth, is one which can’t be false: a
proposition such as, for example, ‘it’s raining or it’s not’, which is
going to be true whatever the weather. ‘Either it’s raining or it’s not’
isn’t a mathematical truth, though, because it’s not general, it’s too
specific.

So, Ramsey’s view was that you put the two together, so that
mathematical truths are truths which are completely general but also
logical, i.e., tautological: they can’t be false. That was the way in
which Ramsey fixed a defect in Principia Mathematica.

NW: So what you’re saying is that for Ramsey ‘2 + 3 = 5’ isn’t about
adding two apples to three apples and getting five apples. It operates at a
very general level. But it’s also tautological: so it’s the equivalent of
saying that A = A.

HM: Yes, that’s right, it can’t possibly be false. And it’s the
combination of those two features—of being completely general and
of being necessarily true—that makes it mathematical.

NW: Obviously, not all truths are mathematical truths. What did Ramsey
say about contingent truths, the truths that could have been otherwise?

HM: He said that what matters about beliefs that could have been false is
that you want the ones you have to be true; and his question was, ‘Why?’
Answering that question, he said, will tell you what it is that distinguishes
one truth from another.

NW: Could you give an example of that?

HM: Suppose I want to go and buy some milk from a local shop. Of
course, I’m not going to go until and unless I believe the shop is
open. That’s the function of belief: a belief that a shop is open and
sells milk, combined with my desire to get some milk, will get me to
go to the shop. But unless those beliefs—that the shop is open, and
sells milk—are true, then I won’t get what I went to get, namely
milk. So, for Ramsey, what’s good about having true beliefs is that if
you act on your beliefs when they’re true you’ll get what you want to
get, and if you act on them when they’re false, you won’t.

NW: That’s surely not true, though, is it, because you can act on false
beliefs and by a bit of luck get what you want?

HM: You never act on just one belief: you act on a combination of
beliefs, and if they’re all true you will get what you want. If two of
them are false then they may, as it were, cancel out. But truth is the
property of beliefs, says Ramsey, which ensures that if you act on
beliefs all of which have that property you will get what you want.

NW: So you can only be sure of getting what you want if you believe true
things.

HM: That’s right.

NW: Now how does that amount to an improvement on what went before?

HM: Ramsey builds this idea up into a theory which has since been
called Success Semantics, which says that the conditions under
which your actions succeed—your shop is open, it has milk, etc.—
are the conditions in which the beliefs you acted on are true. If you
ask what a contingent belief—the sort we’re talking about—is
about, i.e., what its content is, then a standard answer is that its
content is its truth conditions, i.e., the conditions under which it will
be true.

This makes Ramsey’s theory the basis of a semantics which says
that a belief’s truth conditions—what it’s about, what has to be the
case for it to be true—are given by the conditions under which any
actions it would make you perform will succeed. That’s what’s
meant by saying that the success conditions of the actions that beliefs
cause are the conditions under which those beliefs are true. It tells
you what beliefs are about in terms of how they make you behave
and when that behaviour will succeed in getting you what you want.

NW: The example you gave about getting milk from the shop seems fairly
straightforward. If I want milk, I’ll go to the shop to get it—believing that
the shop is open, that it sells milk, etc. But with many of our actions it is
not absolutely clear to us what our beliefs are. Does it follow from what
Ramsey is saying that somebody else might know better than we do what
our beliefs are?

HM: They might well. There’s nothing in this theory that says that
you have to be conscious of the beliefs you act on; in fact, very often
you’re not. For example, when I’m about to cross the road I
habitually look to the right where traffic might be coming from. I do
that without thinking about it; but what makes me do it is my belief
that traffic here keeps to the left, so you need to look to the right to
avoid being run over. And if that belief were false because I hadn’t
realized that I was in France, for example, my looking right instead
of left might well be fatal.

NW: But usually when we use the word ‘content’— the ‘content’ of a
belief—we’re thinking of something linguistic: we obviously use sentences
to communicate. But it sounds as if, for Ramsey, a belief doesn’t have to be
conscious and perhaps doesn’t even have to be the kind of thing you could
put into a sentence yourself.

HM: No, it certainly doesn’t. One of the virtues of Ramsey’s view
for me is that it explains how animals have beliefs; when cats learn
how to recognize the approach of a dog, they will believe it’s a dog,
and take appropriate action; if they believed, falsely, that it wasn’t a
dog, they could be in bad trouble. So there’s no presumption that, in
order to believe something, you have to be able to put it into
language. And even if, like us, you can use English sentences to say
what you believe, the content of those beliefs isn’t given by what
those sentences mean: it’s the other way round. The theory of
meaning that goes with Ramsey’s view is that we use sentences to
communicate beliefs whose content is given by how they enable us
to act in ways that will get us what we want. In other words, it’s a
‘belief first’ theory of the meanings of sentences.

The rival theory which—oddly enough, in my view—is more
popular, is the ‘language first’ theory. This says that unless you’ve
got a language you can’t have beliefs, which seems to me absurd,
and that what a belief is about—its content—is given by the
independently established meaning of sentences that express it. For
some reason, which is not clear to me, that view, which goes back to
Frege, is the dominant view in the philosophy of language and the
philosophy of mind.

NW: Ramsey was an atheist; his brother ended up Archbishop of
Canterbury. They both had beliefs about God, different beliefs, how would
that cash out in terms of what we’ve just been talking about?

HM: One of the things that as a fellow atheist I rather regret is that
if the people who believe in an afterlife, for example, are wrong,
they will never know. If I’m wrong, I probably will know. This is
mildly irritating. But the theory of Success Semantics, as I’m calling
it, doesn’t say that you have to know whether your actions are
successful, and sometimes you don’t. Suppose you make a will, for
example, because you want to leave particular things to particular
people, and you believe that they will get these things after you die if
you make this will. And they will, if this belief of yours is true. If
your belief is false, they won’t get them; your will-making action
will fail. But either way you won’t know. So in this case the truth of
your belief, about the efficacy of your will, will make your action
succeed even though you won’t be there to see its success. And the
same goes for beliefs about the afterlife.

NW: From the enthusiasm of your exposition of Ramsey’s ideas it’s
obvious that you think that he was right on many topics. How would you
rank him as a philosopher?

HM: I think Ramsey is one of the philosophical geniuses. If you
wanted a musical analogue, it would be Mozart—except that Mozart
lived on to the ripe old age of 36. Ramsey was ten years younger
than that when he died, having founded a branch of mathematics, two
branches of economics, subjective decision theory (also widely used
by economists), a new theory of truth, a theory of semantics, and
several other things that I haven’t even mentioned. Most
philosophers at their best do less than half of that in a life three times
that long.
