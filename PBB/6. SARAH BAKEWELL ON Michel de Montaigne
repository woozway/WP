Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Back

SARAH BAKEWELL ON
Michel de Montaigne

David Edmonds: Academics, writers, and journalists owe Michel de
Montaigne a debt of gratitude, for Montaigne can claim to have invented
the literary form known as the essay. Montaigne was born near Bordeaux
in 1533 and died in 1592. In his essays, he addressed himself to a variety
of subjects and drew on his own experiences: his reading, his travels, the
people he’d met, his beliefs and feelings. The topics he discussed ranged
from international affairs to his sex life, to his pet dog. Many great
thinkers have been influenced by Montaigne and he retains a following
today. His admirers include Sarah Bakewell, author of a book about
Montaigne: How to Live, or, A Life of Montaigne in One Question and
Twenty Attempts at an Answer.

Nigel Warburton: The topic today is Montaigne and how to live. Could
you say a little bit about who Michel de Montaigne was?

Sarah Bakewell: Michel de Montaigne was a wine grower and
magistrate, mayor of Bordeaux, and various other things in the
course of his not very long life. He lived in the area just outside
Bordeaux, and had a fairly undistinguished, ordinary kind of career
as a lawyer and administrator in the town. Then he decided to leave
all that and reflect on his life, and after that came a book called the
Essays which became an instant bestseller and still is today, well
over 400 years later. It’s never really lacked for readers and
enthusiasts.

NW: So what triggered that radical change in career?

SB: The impression he gives is that he felt that he had reached the
point in life where he wanted to retire from active duty and reflect
on his experience. In an inscription he made on his wall celebrating
his decision, he described himself as if he was almost at the end of
his life or certainly well into a mid-life crisis; in fact he was about
37. His father had died recently which had meant that he inherited
the family wine-growing estate—a lot of responsibility. So it was a
combination of that and this desire to retreat into himself, which was
a tradition he’d picked up from the ancient philosophers, particularly
the Stoics. Seneca used to recommend a period of reflection and
philosophy once you’d completed your contribution to the world of
public affairs.

NW: There he is in his study reflecting on himself and on his life; what
kind of essays did he produce as a result?

SB: When he first started, he wrote in a fairly conventional way: a
page or two, on various themes, most of which he picked up from his
favourite classical authors. So he loved to read Plutarch, Seneca, the
historians, some of the poets. They gave him the idea of assembling
different materials on particular themes, which is interesting enough.
But if he’d just stopped there I don’t think we would still be reading
him today. Instead, after a while, he became more adventurous and
started writing in a much more questioning way, particularly writing
about himself and his own experience and the people that he’d talked
to, and the things that he’d found when he looked into himself, his
emotions, and his own reasonings.

NW: One of those essays was focused on death which was a very
poignant subject for him because he had had a very near-death experience.

SB: He was already quite obsessed with death in what today seems
a rather morbid way. Of course, he had lost some people close to
him including his best friend, his father, and a brother. But he was
released from some of this obsession with death after his own close
brush with it. He was out riding one day when somebody crashed
into him and he was sent flying from his horse. He was knocked
unconscious and was quite badly bruised; he could easily have been
killed. His friends carried him home, and he gradually began to
come to, but for some time he was floating in a half-conscious state.
He started to reflect on that experience afterwards because he felt
he’d tasted death with his lips, he’d brushed close to death—he had
all these wonderful ways of describing it. What he discovered was
that there was really nothing to fear in that experience of which he
had been so terrified before. He found it was actually just a
voluptuous drifting, almost a pleasant sensation like when you’re
falling asleep. In fact, he was later told that while he was having this
pleasant floating experience he’d been ripping at his clothes and
vomiting blood, and looking as if he was in agony. So he thought,
well, death might look like that from the outside, but from the inside,
nature takes over and prepares the experience for you. It also
changed his focus more towards life, and more towards philosophy
and reflection.

NW: Philosophy could have taken him to an obsession with death,
anyway, couldn’t it, because in the ancient tradition philosophers learn to
die?

SB: Well, yes, he took the idea that that’s what philosophy is from
the ancient philosophers: Cicero’s ‘To philosophize is to learn how
to die’ became the title of one of his essays. I think he came to the
conclusion that if philosophizing was a kind of obsessing over your
own death, it wasn’t going to get you very far, and, if anything, it
made dying and the process of coming to terms with death harder. He
was probably more influenced by an idea taken partly from the
Epicureans—that to philosophize is to learn how to live, more than
to learn how to die.

NW: There’s also an element that ran throughout his thinking: that his
own personal experience trumps any theorizing.

SB: Yes, and his near-death experience and the philosophical
thoughts he took out of it provide one of the absolutely essential
examples of that. He was a great believer in experience as the main
source of philosophical wisdom; one of his greatest essays is called
‘Of Experience’. That’s a huge essay that rambles on about all sorts
of things, as many of his essays do. But it is all circling around the
idea that you learn primarily through your own experience. This is
also why he thought that peasants who had no book learning had
more wisdom than the great philosophers, because they hadn’t
studied enough to clutter up their minds.

The irony, of course, is that Montaigne arrived at this view after a
lifetime of reading about other people’s experiences—reading,
absolutely passionately and with deep attention, the classical
philosophers and historians, and everybody else. I think his idea of
personal experience has more to do with his idea of nature and of
human nature. Both his reading and his own life led him to the
thought that we really just need to relax and rely on our own nature,
rather than trying to intellectualize or rationalize things. That’s the
feeling behind it, rather than what we might see as anti-
intellectualism.

NW: There’s also a tendency to contradict himself—which is
disconcerting in a philosopher.

SB: It is, and he said, ‘I may contradict myself but the truth I never
contradict.’ He’s saying that his self and his perceptions shift
constantly, and he stays true to them. Thus he must keep moving. His
contradictions are a part of what make the Essays fascinating
reading: you have a sense of a mind thinking in front of you as you
read. Also, he kept adding to them over a period of 20 years—and
he did tend to add material rather than going back and taking things
out, or correcting them. So you end up with this incredibly complex
surface of the text where different parts of it have been added at
different stages, and sometimes one sentence will contradict the one
before. But that is part of the sense of constant movement that you get
in his thought.

NW: Sometimes Montaigne seems to suggest that subjective experience
is truth, that subjective experience is all that really matters.

SB: Yes, but this is constantly offset, as well, by his fascination
with the world external to himself, which he approaches both by just
observing the physical world and other creatures, other human
beings, and by reading and sharing the experience of countless other
people. There’s a constant fascination with the richness and variety
of the outside world, so you never get the feeling of a mind that’s lost
gazing into itself. The whole texture of the Essays is rich and varied,
full of anecdotes and stories. He’s got this one moment where he is
watching his cat staring intently into a tree; then a bird falls out dead
between the cat’s paws, so Montaigne goes off wondering why this
is, what’s happening? There’s a constant mixture between that kind
of observation and looking into himself.

NW: One of his lines is that you should come to philosophy almost by
accident, not set out to philosophize. As a philosopher I find that slightly
odd.

SB: I find it odd as well, although I think in a way you have to
come to almost everything in life by accident. But he said that, if he
was a philosopher at all, he was an ‘accidental philosopher’. What
he meant by that was that he wrote so much, that every now and then
one of his remarks was bound to coincide with something said by
one of the great philosophers of the past.

He’s not a systematic thinker: he didn’t devote himself to
philosophy in the sense of going on a quest to discover the truth
about the world, or a rigorous interpretation of it. You do get a
feeling of somebody who’s just going on along with life and
responding to it, but trying to always look for wiser or more
philosophical ways of doing this.

NW: You’ve already mentioned Stoicism and Epicureanism, and the other
main school of the age in philosophy, Scepticism, was a major influence on
him as well. So it’s clear that he did have a classical education that
affected the categories which he used in perceiving the world.

SB: All of those philosophies were hugely important to him. The
late Renaissance was a time when so much of that thought had been
rediscovered. Scepticism, in particular, had a huge impact on his
world, but then he also became the prime transmitter of Pyrrhonian
scepticism, founded by Pyrrho and developed by Sextus Empiricus
in the ancient world. He embodied it in so much of his thought and
writing in the Essays, that he transmitted it to generations of thinkers
after him.

It’s almost impossible to imagine Descartes going through his
process of radical doubt without his having come across the
modernized version of sceptical doubt which Montaigne had picked
up from the ancient world. Descartes doubted absolutely everything
as a way of laying bare everything to the foundation so that he could
build it all up from scratch again on a more secure basis. Montaigne,
instead, accepted that everything was in doubt, but he seemed quite
happy to live with that. The doubt itself gave him a foundation for a
way of living that considered different perspectives on situations,
that made it possible to avoid being too sure of one’s self. So doubt,
I think, became a way of life for Montaigne, whereas for Descartes it
was just a stage to be gone through. Without Montaigne, I would
almost go so far as to say that there could be no Descartes.

NW: The connection between Montaigne and other philosophers is
interesting because he’s difficult to pigeonhole as a philosopher at all.

SB: There’s always been a debate about whether you can consider
Montaigne a philosopher, and it’s by no means certain that he
considered himself one. He is a philosopher if you take quite a broad
definition of philosophy, drawn from the ancient traditions he
himself followed, according to which philosophy is practical. It’s a
pragmatic set of thought experiments, approaches, ideas: ways of
being that enable you to live in a better way.

NW: There’s a sense in which you learn about how you might live
through reading how he lived. So he’s not didactic, he’s not saying you
ought to live as I did, but by engaging with his essays you are encouraged
to think differently.

SB: You could compare him more to novelists than to philosophers
for that very reason. If you read a novel like War and Peace or Pride
and Prejudice, and learn something from it that you can apply to
your own life, it’s because you’re observing other people living their
lives. You come out with more ideas than you had when you went in;
you come out having shared somebody else’s experience, and
perhaps you are a little bit the wiser for it. Also, as an aside, a novel
is entertaining; Montaigne is entertaining, and let’s not underestimate
the importance of that. He’s fun, he’s pleasurable to read.

For me, certainly, what I have learned from Montaigne is very
much on that level. I’ve seen this sixteenth-century man coping with
problems in his life or thinking about his life and reading in a way
that I can understand and be part of. I can’t understand all of it
because there is a big historical gulf between us, but I can certainly
share a part of that experience through his communication of it, and
that’s very much what a novel does. In Montaigne, it also becomes a
form of philosophy because he does it overtly, and on a level that
draws deliberately on philosophical traditions.

NW: What sort of influence did he have on subsequent philosophers?

SB: I mentioned he had an influence on Descartes which was not
really acknowledged, but I think it was there. He had a tremendous
influence on Pascal—another by no means professional philosopher.
Pascal found Montaigne’s scepticism very hard to take, and tried to
rid himself of it. In later years—and, again, it tends to be people a
bit on the fringes of philosophy—he had an influence on Voltaire.
Rousseau was very much influenced by Montaigne. The whole
project of writing an autobiography, or writing about yourself in this
‘warts and all’ honest way, was something Rousseau seems to have
picked up from Montaigne, but he disowned that influence. In later
years, Montaigne was certainly an influence on Nietzsche, so again
we’re talking about somebody on the fringes of the accepted
mainstream of philosophy. Nietzsche thought that Montaigne was the
person you should read in order to learn how to live.

NW: You’ve spent about five years researching and writing this book,
how did you start the project?

SB: Well, I discovered Montaigne by accident. I’d heard of him,
but didn’t read him until I picked him up for a long train journey, in a
shop where it was the only English language book—this was in
Budapest. So it was a total accident, very suitable for an accidental
philosopher. After that, I read him incessantly; he was a bedside
companion for many years. I wasn’t sure I could write about
somebody I admired so much, somebody that seemed always to be
one step ahead of me. Montaigne certainly is always one step ahead
of anybody who writes about him, because he is so contradictory and
so varied: whatever you think you can say about him, he’s already
said it about himself. But, gradually, I got the idea of trying to write,
not just about him, but about all the people who’ve read him over the
years and have made different Montaignes out of him. That, besides
Montaigne himself and his biography, became the focus of my
interest.
