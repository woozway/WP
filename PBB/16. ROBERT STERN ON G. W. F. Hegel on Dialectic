Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Back

ROBERT STERN ON
G. W. F. Hegel on Dialectic

David Edmonds: The late eighteenth-, early nineteenth-century German
philosopher, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, has had an enormous
influence on western thought. Karl Marx, for example, was heavily
indebted to him. But his prose is notoriously complex, and he’s not
someone to open with in Philosophy 101: that would be like learning to
read with Ulysses, or starting the piano by attempting Rachmaninov. It
takes a lucid mind to decode him, and so Philosophy Bites turned to
Professor Robert Stern, who’s based at the University of Sheffield. We
asked Professor Stern to explain the one idea in Hegel that even most non-
Hegelians have heard of: thesis-antithesis-synthesis, the idea that’s
usually known as Hegel’s Dialectic.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we’re going to focus on is Hegel’s Dialectic. I
don’t know much about Hegel, but I know the caricature of the dialectic is
that somebody puts forward a thesis, then there’s an antithesis, a
contradiction of it. And somehow, miraculously, from the clash of these two
things, a synthesis emerges. Is that about right?

Robert Stern: Yes, you are right that the idea is often associated
with Hegel, and it is a bit of a clichéd caricature, as you say. In fact,
Hegel very rarely used those terms, ‘thesis’, ‘antithesis’, and
‘synthesis’. But, on the other hand, there is certainly a large element
of truth to the basic story.

NW: So is this just a way of describing what characteristically happens
in a debate or does it refer to episodes in history? What is it?

RS: The best place to start is to think of it in the way that Hegel
presents it, that is, by going back to Plato and to dialogue and
discussion, but adding to that the particular concern that Hegel had,
which was that, especially in philosophy, one should avoid dogmatic
presentation of your views, just insisting that you’re right, and that
the other person’s wrong. If you do that, you don’t really establish
that what you’re thinking is right, as against the other person. You
can’t legitimately just insist that you’re correct, and they’re not, as
they will have reasons for their view, just as you do for yours. So,
one way of handling that situation, and making progress in enquiry in
a non-dogmatic way, is to try and find problems within your
opponent’s view, that they themselves can be brought to recognize—
what’s sometimes called ‘internal critique’.

For example, if you think you’re a great defender of freedom, and
think of yourself as a great liberal, and I can show you, ‘Well, yes,
but if you followed through your views, you’d end up with a very
repressive society’—that should show you that, in your own terms,
you’ve gone wrong. And you might then feel that you had to change
your views entirely and go to the opposite extreme—by abandoning
liberalism, for example, in favour of an authoritarian position. So,
you might give up one view, and move over to the opposite, equally
one-sided view, in Hegel’s terms, which has its own internal
problems. Then you have to show that the only real progress is
somehow finding a balance between these competing positions.

So, to take an example, which isn’t directly Hegel’s, we can
obviously have debates in philosophy between people who believe
in free will, and those people who believe in hard determinism—
roughly the view that because every event has a prior cause or is
governed by a natural law, we lack freedom. If you can show in
various ways that both sides are one-sided, or are inadequate, that
they leave out important accounts of the issues at stake, then you’re
working towards a position that might involve, or incorporate
elements of, both views. That’s the sense in which you’re looking for
some kind of synthesis. But then, again, that synthesis can often turn
out to be premature, to involve problems of its own. So you move on
to another view that competes with that one. And so on. So, this
process gives a structure to a discussion, a structure that is found in a
lot of Hegel’s works, not unlike a series of pyramids.

NW: So, are you saying dialectic is really a method for discovering
truth?

RS: Yes, I think that’s broadly speaking right. You’re using certain
sorts of principles of reasoning to move from one position to
another, better one—and you can also again see how Hegel’s works
have this sort of structure, as a method of enquiry. Obviously, if
you’re going to use that method for reaching the truth, and if you’re
going to claim to get to truth at the end, you’re first of all going to
have to make sure that you move through the positions in a pretty
systematic way so you haven’t left anything out, because that would
then be a view that you haven’t considered, and therefore whose
truth you hadn’t assessed, as a possible rival to the final position you
end up with. So you need a structure that’s going to take you
systematically through various positions. Also you need to start from
the right place. So you have to start from the simplest position on the
issue, because if you start too far down the line, again you’ll have
missed out various options that you should have considered earlier
on. Often the structure of Hegel’s work begins from very simple
positions. So, Hegel’s Logic, which is the first part of his system of
philosophy and basically concerns metaphysics, famously begins
from a view that just thinks there is Being. That’s its theory of
reality: all there is, is being, not individuals, properties, events, and
so on—just being. That is as simple a view as you’re going to get.
Similarly, the Phenomenology of Spirit begins with a very simple
view of knowledge: that knowledge is just taking things in
immediately through perception, and no more. So that gives a
beginning point to the way the enquiry’s going to work, and from
which it can unfold. And then, of course, you are also hoping that
you’re going to reach a stable end point, because, of course, there
might be a worry that you just have one position and it ends up
collapsing into another, and then into another, and into another, and
you never end up with anything that’s stable.

NW: Just to get a grasp on this notion of dialectic though, is it the
equivalent of saying, ‘The truth is always in the middle’? It sounds a bit
like that: here’s one side, here’s another side, synthesize them: there’s a bit 
of truth in both of them.

RS: There’s something in that. The phrase, ‘Hegelian middle’ is
often used: the third way. I used to describe this as ‘the third way’ in
lectures before the term was hijacked by politicians. But that’s often
how Hegel likes to present things, and again some background to this
is useful. One important figure in the background for Hegel is Kant.
An important element in Kant’s story about metaphysics is that
metaphysics ends in antinomies which are literally unresolvable
contradictions. For Kant, these partly show the inability of the human
mind to settle these questions, and partly that they’re somehow bad
or flawed questions that we, as human beings, get ourselves into.
One way of thinking of Hegel is as someone who thinks these
debates are genuine, but where he is more optimistic than Kant—he
thinks the antinomies can, on the whole, be resolved.

Some terminology he uses to discuss this is the distinction
between what he calls ‘the understanding’, ‘dialectic’, and ‘reason’.
The understanding is characterized as a form of thinking that thinks in
a relatively limited, though important, way. It just thinks ‘freedom is
freedom’, say: to be free is to be able to just do what you like, that’s
what freedom is. And taking it in that way, it seems an obvious
contrast with there being any moral obligations or having to respect
the claims of other people, as these limit what you can do. And you
might think, ‘Well, freedom is one thing, moral demands on us are
obviously something different, and these cannot be reconciled, so to
be free I must reject morality.’ That’s the view of the 
‘understanding’, which just sees a clear contrast here. The
dialectical moment is when that position leads into a kind of
contradiction. So, for example, to the person who just thinks that
‘freedom is doing whatever you like’, you might say, ‘Well, what
happens if what you like is taking drugs?’ Or, ‘Why is doing what
you like free, because after all what you like comes from your
desires and your tastes or your upbringing. And things that aren’t
within your control, so why is that freedom?’ And that might make
the person then see, ‘Well, hang on, freedom is obviously more
complicated than that.’ The dialectical moment, which Hegel
associates with a kind of scepticism, is a sort of despair. You might
think now, ‘Well, yes, freedom is this great mysterious thing, I really
can’t understand it at all.’ And that’s a point again where Hegel
associates it back to a Platonic moment. Again in Plato’s dialogues,
the confident interlocutor of Socrates starts by thinking he knows
what he’s talking about, and then realizes, ‘Oh my goodness, you
know, it’s all falling apart, I don’t understand this at all.’ But then the
moment of resolution is when you say, ‘Well, wait, maybe it’s all
falling apart because I’m thinking about freedom in this one-sided
and inadequate way. And when I become more sophisticated about
what freedom is, then I can perhaps see it is more reconcilable with
moral obligations than I thought it was.’ That’s the sense in which
you then end up with a kind of middle position, because you see that
the one-sided view isn’t really opposed to its opposite.
Understanding always thinks in terms of either/or, Hegel says. Either
free will, or determinism. Or, either freedom, or moral obligations.
Or, either no state, or tyranny. And the dialectical moment is when
you begin to see that basically things are much more complicated
than that, and that both sides need to be brought together somehow.
Hegel thought, ‘This is why philosophy’s so hard: because it
requires us to think through both sides of the problem.’ And that’s
why the perspective of reason, which is this resolving moment, is
very difficult from the standpoint of normal human understanding,
which wants to keep both sides apart and distinct from one another
—so it can’t see how freedom is compatible with determinism, and
so on.

NW: I don’t understand why that’s not begging the question, because you
can’t assume that the truth lies in the synthesis. I might dogmatically
assert that ‘torture is morally wrong, in every circumstance’. Somebody
might contradict me, and from that kind of clash of statement and its
antithesis I might still emerge quite rationally justified in believing torture
is always morally wrong. Hegel seems to be assuming that the truth will lie
in the synthesis, not in the initial position.

RS: Well, of course, the wrongness of torture may be just the stable
end point you are after! In that case, there may be no further synthesis
to be achieved. But I assume you are imagining people who question
this claim of yours, who contradict you. But why should you be
moved by that, why shouldn’t you just stick to your view, rather than
feel pushed towards some sort of synthesis? Obviously, this will
depend on them having reasons for their view: they aren’t just
claiming this for fun; for example, they may think torture is justified
to get vital information from the enemy, and so on. I think Hegel’s
point is that you can only emerge rationally justified in your own
position if you can find some way to show your opponent that
something goes wrong with their position, in terms they would
accept—otherwise, you are dogmatically insisting that you alone
know right from wrong here. Of course, this may be very hard to do,
and so it may be hard to get anywhere, and the dialectic may break
down. I think, first of all, Hegel would say that he’s not assuming
anything here, this is just his pattern of how he hopes things might
turn out. And if they do turn out like that, we can make progress. But
there’s no guarantee, there’s no a priori guarantee at the beginning of
this exercise that that is how they will turn out. On the other hand,
there’s no a priori reason for scepticism, either. So, all you can do is
try and conduct this dialogue.

NW: I can see how that could work as a tentative method for
philosophical debate, and it could be very productive in certain areas such
as the free will debate that you’ve discussed. Now, if I’ve got it right,
Hegel doesn’t stop there, though. He’s talking about the dialectic applied
to historical change. How does Hegel employ the dialectic in relation to
history?

RS: Well, again, we have to be slightly wary of a caricature here.
But in a broad sense, Hegel’s view of history is a kind of idealism in
the sense that it relates to ideas and thinking, and the way cultures
and civilizations have thought about the world. Ideas make a big
difference to history, as far as Hegel’s concerned. And he will then
say, I think, that these ideas then played out in this broadly
dialectical manner. So, again, coming back to the case of freedom,
Hegel thinks that one important movement in history is the movement
from thinking that just one of us is entitled to freedom (a king, say),
to some (the patricians of ancient Athens, say), to all of us, where
obviously this development relates to changing views of what
freedom is, what we are, how we relate to one another, and so on.
Hegel thinks that, again, that’s been played out in this broadly
dialectical way, as different views have come along, that have
conceived of freedom in an inadequate manner.

So, one example of that, in Hegel’s own time, would be the
French Revolution. For Hegel, the French Revolution was the main
historical event of his lifetime, and, like a lot of intellectuals of the
period, he initially viewed it with great enthusiasm, but then was
horrified by the results: the Terror, and so on. Hegel has an
interesting discussion of where the notion of freedom involved in the
French Revolution is one-sided. You’ve got a contrast between
thinking of freedom as doing what you want—roughly, following
your own particular interests—and thinking of freedom as
transcending all your interests, which are seen as limiting you in
some way: instead, freedom consists in acting to further the general
good, or the universal, rather than the particular. So, I’m not free
unless I’m working for the good of society as a whole. If I’m just
working on my own particular projects, then I’m merely particular,
I’m merely confined to acting for myself. The danger of no longer
seeing yourself as a particular individual in this way, is that you
basically set yourself up as speaking for everyone, for the general
will. But then the problem is: who represents the general will? Who
can be that one person who speaks for all? This problem provides
Hegel with his dialectical diagnosis of the French Revolution.
Anyone who stood up and said, ‘I am the Revolution, I represent the
general will’, met with the response, ‘Well, you’re not, you’re just
some particular person, you know, you’re not really representing the
universal in this sense. So you have to be cut down’, and so the
French Revolution, by the nature of its inner logic, could have no
leader, and could only degenerate into the kind of senseless killing,
which Hegel diagnosed in this way.

Now, that’s a case where Hegel’s saying that an idea—here, a
certain conception of what it is to be free, a certain conception of
how we might represent society as a whole, by somehow giving up
all our different interests, concerns, and roles—has had an
historically real and disastrous effect. Now, he’s not claiming to
offer a full historical explanation of the French Revolution and the
Terror here, it’s not that he is claiming that all there is to history is
ideas. But he does think that those ideas are nonetheless important to
how history goes, how societies change, and so on—and, again, such
developments still have this dialectical relation to one another, on
Hegel’s account, as different one-sided viewpoints are played out
over time.

NW: What strikes me as different about Hegel, from many thinkers, was
that he saw things as progressing to a better state. I don’t know if
everybody feels that way today—certainly lots of philosophers are more
pessimistic about the idea of progress. I wonder if you could say something
about Hegel’s views on progress.

RS: Yes, I think that’s interesting. Broadly speaking, I hold the view
that he is, as you put it, optimistic. There are darker sides to Hegel
and, as we’ve mentioned, when he talks about the dialectic itself, it
goes through this rather dark moment. He calls the Phenomenology,
which is one of the works where this is carried out, a ‘highway of
despair’, because all the views you might start with turn out to be
internally problematic and are taken away from you, as they are
shown to collapse. And, as I said, there is always a risk that in being
taken away from you, there will then be no further progress. But the
works themselves, broadly speaking, point towards a kind of
resolution. You’re right that one contrast between Hegel and his
successors is that they’re much less optimistic. So, if you take
Adorno’s idea, say, of the negative dialectic, you can tell by the
name, the idea is that, in a sense, it breaks down, that there won’t be
the moment of resolution. Or, Kierkegaard famously writes a book
called Either/Or, which is precisely a deliberate echo of Hegel’s
distinction between the understanding and reason that we discussed
earlier: where Hegel thought that the ‘either/or’ of the understanding
could be resolved by reason into some sort of more unified position,
Kierkegaard thought that these different views must remain at odds
with one another—so that you are ultimately faced with a choice
between them. So, for example, Kierkegaard holds that no
reconciliation is possible between the religious outlook and more
secular views—you are faced with a choice. On the whole, analytic
philosophers are more on Hegel’s side than some of these
‘continental’ thinkers, in making more optimistic assumptions about
enquiry. The business of finding philosophical problems, and then
trying to find ways of doing justice to both sides of the debate, and
making careful distinctions, and finding different conceptual options
that might do justice somehow to both sides—I think that’s not
uncommon in analytic philosophy. A lot of contemporary analytic
philosophers spend their time trying to do this.

NW: I was thinking of parallels with John Stuart Mill. In his discussion
of freedom of speech, he talks about the importance of having your view
challenged by somebody who actually believes the opposite of you. The
process of the collision of truth with error is a really important way of
discovering and energizing the truth that you eventually end up with.

RS: Yes, I think that’s right. And there are connections to do with
other ideas in Mill, such as fallibilism. Because, again, to engage in
this discussion you’re going to have to, in a sense, be open to the
thought that what you think can be challenged. It doesn’t mean that
you have to think you’re actually wrong, but you have to be able to
think, ‘Well, it’s worth at least listening to the other person, because
I might be mistaken.’ For Hegel, that’s an important part of
modernity, that we don’t claim infallibility for our views. We do take
justification and being able to defend our views seriously. And that’s
why in the end you’ll have to be drawn into this dialogue and
discussion.

NW: I can see how Hegel’s approach, with something like freedom, could
be very illuminating. But if you take another example, say, homeopathy,
where there’s this internal explanation that the more dilute a substance,
the more effective it is as a drug. Now, that is considered absurd by many
doctors, but within the homeopathic community it’s internally consistent.

RS: Yes. I think it’s right that one of the threats to the approach is
that you potentially run across a position that has this kind of internal
coherence. What you would want to find is presumably that there are
links between these claims about homeopathic medicine and some
commitment to evidence concerning cures, and how it successfully
deals with illnesses, and so on. That’s going to be part of the story,
presumably—and then, of course, homeopathy is open to challenge if
you can produce evidence of this kind that it does or doesn’t work,
and so on. So again, in theory, one can see the worry here: that two
equally coherent positions might face each other, with no obvious
internal problems forcing the one to take account of the other. But, in
practice, in the positions Hegel discusses, he claims that this is not
how things work out.

NW: Obviously, you’ve immersed yourself in the works of Hegel. What’s
so rewarding about reading his work?

RS: Well, this may be a matter of temperament, but I find the
project of working through these really quite formidable difficulties,
and looking for positions that will resolve them while somehow
doing justice to both sides, to be a very exciting project. Hegel
worked across a whole range of different problems. We’ve talked
mainly about freedom, but there are issues he dealt with in political
philosophy, issues in art, in religion, and so on, as well as many in
metaphysics and epistemology. So, there is a wide-ranging and
complex programme here. And the notorious difficulty of Hegel’s
writing, though often off-putting to some, is not, I think, gratuitous if
you see it in these terms: because he is trying to think through both
sides, or more than one side, and show you how each passes over
into the other. It is inevitably hard for him to articulate this in a
straightforward way, as you could if you were just defending one
position and refuting the other. So, I am prepared to forgive him
here. And, again, going back to Kant, I think the difference between a
Kantian and a Hegelian sensibility, is that Kant leaves you with these
antinomies and a number of dualisms. For Kant, both sides are
equally plausible; really, there’s nothing much we can do about it. I
think wanting to go further, and look for some sort of resolution, is a
natural enough stance. Most philosophers I’ve met have that desire in
them, to do this kind of thing, because that’s often why we’re in the
business of philosophy at all. We have an interest in thinking through
these difficult issues, and not being satisfied with one-sided
solutions, and so on. So, I think it comes naturally to us—or at least
it does to me.
