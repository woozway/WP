Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Back

PETER SINGER ON
Henry Sidgwick’s Ethics

David Edmonds: The most important philosopher in the utilitarian
tradition …? Who would you go for? Jeremy Bentham? John Stuart Mill?
Peter Singer of Princeton University puts the case for a less familiar
nineteenth-century thinker, a man little known outside academia: Henry
Sidgwick.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we’re focusing on is Henry Sidgwick’s ethics.
Who was Henry Sidgwick?

Peter Singer: Henry Sidgwick was a late nineteenth-century
Victorian philosopher, professor of philosophy at Cambridge
University. He produced what many people—and I’m one of them—
think is among the greatest works of ethics ever written, the Methods
of Ethics, published first in 1874. Throughout his lifetime he kept
reworking it, so the final edition is the seventh, published
posthumously in 1907.

NW: What kind of a philosopher was he? What was his central theme?

PS: Sidgwick was a utilitarian. When people talk about the
classical utilitarians, they tend to talk about Jeremy Bentham, John
Stuart Mill, and Henry Sidgwick. I regard Sidgwick as the greatest
of them as a philosopher. Obviously, Bentham was a pioneer and did
an enormous amount of work about political reform, law, and
jurisprudence on a huge range of topics—an incredible polymath.
John Stuart Mill was a wonderful popular writer, and his On Liberty
was a classic; his Utilitarianism was also very popular and sold
well, and helped spread his ideas; and, of course, The Subjection of
Women was far ahead of its time. But Sidgwick, without a doubt, is
the most careful and thorough philosopher of the three, very fair-
minded, always thinking of objections, and always clear and precise
in his concepts.

NW: Within utilitarianism there are many different forms. What kind of
utilitarian was he?

PS: Sidgwick was a hedonistic utilitarian. That means that he
thinks that the good to be maximized is pleasure or happiness: the
greatest possible balance of that over the amount of pain or suffering.
He was also what today we would call an act consequentialist,
judging each individual action in terms of whether it leads to better
consequences. (In contrast, rule consequentialists first decide what
rules would have the best consequences, if generally followed, and
then judge each act in terms of whether it conforms to those rules.)
These terms were not part of Sidgwick’s vocabulary. But, I think,
he’s really saying that every act we do ought to be judged in terms of
whether it produces the best consequences, even though, in judging
the individual act, we ought to take into account whether it is likely
to weaken support for a useful rule.

NW: So, if I were to lie to you now and tell you the interview will be over
in a few seconds, judging that ethically would be just a question of looking
at the consequences or likely consequences of my saying that?

PS: Yes, that’s right. Now, Sidgwick might say that, for ordinary,
everyday life we know that telling the truth is generally a better thing
to do, so you should not really even think about telling a lie unless
you have reason to believe that there are some rather exceptional
circumstances. Still, what you said is correct. It’s not the fact that
there’s a general rule against lying that would make your lie wrong,
but rather what the particular consequences are going to be.

NW: That makes him sound like Jeremy Bentham whose utilitarianism is
hedonistic, and also based on individual acts. So what’s the difference?

PS: Bentham is not really a very systematic philosopher in terms of
developing a view, stating it precisely, and looking at difficulties
with it. The other difference is that Bentham is a psychological
hedonist as well, a psychological egoistic hedonist: that is, he thinks
that everything we do, we do for the sake of our own pleasure and
the avoidance of pain. Sidgwick thought that was a mistake, and I
agree with Sidgwick there.

But in any case, in the Methods of Ethics, Sidgwick is trying to
do something different from Bentham. He’s trying to investigate in a
fair-minded way what possible ways there are of thinking about
ethics or, to put it in other words, of answering the question, ‘What
ought I to do?’ He discusses what he calls the ‘method of egoism’,
that is, that the right answer to that question is: ‘I ought to do what’s
in my interest.’ He also discusses at great length—it’s a wonderful
part of the book—common-sense morality, or intuitionism: the idea
that we intuit a range of common-sense principles, including, say,
the principle ‘Do not lie’ or ‘Tell the truth’, which you were
imagining violating a moment ago. He tries to put that principle in its
best form, and then argues that common-sense morality doesn’t really
stand up by itself once you examine it and try to clarify the
principles. He shows that common-sense morality needs to be
supplemented by an underlying principle which turns out to be
identical with the underlying principle of utilitarianism.

NW: How does common-sense morality end up being justified on
utilitarian grounds?

PS: Well, let’s take the example that you used a moment ago about
lying. There’s a common-sense rule that says, ‘You should tell the
truth’ or ‘You should not lie’. But then, when you think about that
rule a little bit more, it’s clearly not absolute. Common-sense
morality doesn’t believe that you should never lie. It has a whole
range of situations in which you can lie. There are rather trivial ones
in which your wife comes to you just before you go out and says,
‘Do you like my new dress?’ Common-sense morality doesn’t really
condemn you if you say, ‘Oh, you look lovely, dear’, when you don’t
quite think so. And, then, at the other extreme, there are the cases
where the only way to prevent some disaster is by telling a lie:
suppose that only by lying can you prevent an evil dictator from
killing many people. Common-sense morality says you may lie in
those circumstances too. So there are several situations where this
rule—like many others—is not clear and precise. And if you ask,
‘How do we decide which are the justifiable exceptions to the rule
against lying?’, Sidgwick’s argument is that the answer always is to
look at the consequences of what you’re doing. So, to Sidgwick, this
suggests that the rule, ‘Do not lie’, is not really a self-evident
intuition: it’s a subordinate principle, and underlying that, there has
to be a more basic intuition which is in fact the intuition of doing
what will have the best consequences.

NW: Well, lying is quite subtle, but with some possible actions, like
torture, many people believe there is an absolute prohibition on torture.
There are no exceptions. Could Sidgwick have coped with that sort of
case?

PS: I think Sidgwick would cope with that case in a way that has
been rather controversial. Probably the rule, ‘Do not torture’, has
good consequences because if you don’t have a rule that says ‘Do
not torture’, then you’ll get a lot of abuses. But there may be some
cases where even though it’s good to uphold, in public, an
exceptionless moral rule, it could be justifiable to do a particular act
in breach of the rule. This is what Sidgwick calls esoteric morality:
it may be right to do something only if the fact that you do it can be
kept secret. So, if you take what is sometimes called a ‘ticking
bomb’ scenario—imagine that a terrorist has planted a nuclear bomb
somewhere in London and the only way to get him to reveal where it
is in time to stop it going off is to torture him, or maybe even to
torture his young daughter in front of him—Sidgwick might say,
‘Well, it would be justified to torture in those extraordinary
circumstances, but it would not be justified to have a rule that says
you may torture, because if you do, people will abuse it.’

NW: One of the great virtues of Bentham’s and Mill’s utilitarianism, is
that they take each individual sentient being seriously and seem to treat
them equally in the calculation that they make about pleasure and pain.
With Sidgwick, it’s almost as if there’s an elite who are clever enough to
foresee the consequences and they can transgress rules but the general
population are too stupid to see the consequences of their actions.

PS: Sidgwick might not have wanted to characterize it quite that
way, but he does think that sometimes some people might be in a
special position of knowledge where they are justified in doing
things that other people not in that position of knowledge would not
be justified in doing. I don’t think this is contrary to any principle of
equality that Bentham accepts—Mill, I’m less sure about—but
Bentham is really talking about ‘each to count for one and no one to
count for more than one’, and Sidgwick would be completely on
board with that. He would say,‘Yes, we count the interests of those
people equally, but we must recognize the reality of the fact that
some people do have particular knowledge or particular abilities
that makes it justifiable for them to do things that are contrary to a
rule that we should uphold publicly, because other people, without
that special knowledge or ability, are likely to go astray.’ You might
think this is an elitist view. Certainly, Bernard Williams thought that:
he called it ‘Government House Utilitarianism’, which conjures up
the image of colonial administrators who know what best to do, but
believe that they cannot trust the ‘natives’ with the truth. I think that’s
a somewhat unfair characterization, but there is an element of this
elitism in it, I wouldn’t deny that.

NW: Isn’t there a risk that if some politicians read Sidgwick’s Methods of
Ethics, they would come to believe that they are in this privileged esoteric
group and justify and rationalize to themselves actions which aren’t
genuinely justifiable by utilitarianism?

PS: There is that risk, and this is the paradox of even talking about
esoteric morality. Maybe we should have kept it in a little seminar
room somewhere for a hand-picked audience because as soon as you
start talking about it, you have exactly the possibility that you
mention, that people may think that I’m one of the group that is
justified in torturing. So yes, there’s a danger in the doctrine, but I
also think there’s something true in the doctrine. I think, for example,
the situation with regard to torture is very hard to get around. I
certainly think it’s better that we have a rule that says you should
never torture. On the other hand, I can’t really say to myself that
torture would be wrong if we were facing the obliteration of
London, and torture were the only way to stop that.

NW: Sidgwick is a philosopher’s philosopher: he’s not known in the way
Mill and Bentham are. You hinted at why that might be: because he’s
writing in a much more complex style. Is that the only reason do you think?

PS: Well, the Methods of Ethics is some 500 pages long, and
Sidgwick’s prose doesn’t leap off the page and really excite you to
go on with it in quite the same way as Mill’s often does. It’s one of
Sidgwick’s virtues that he’s so careful: he considers all the
objections, he qualifies all the claims he makes. It makes him so
much better as a philosopher than Mill. You read Mill and you think,
‘What does he mean here? Does he really mean that? Isn’t that
inconsistent with what he said back there?’ You don’t get that with
Sidgwick. But, on the other hand, you do get something that requires
more concentration and more effort to read.

NW: If we lived in a world run by Henry Sidgwick, what would it be like?

PS: Henry Sidgwick would have rejected that possibility; he never
saw himself as a leader or a ruler. But I suppose he hoped that the
people he was educating would be rulers. So, for one thing, I think
that they would have an overriding concern for the general
happiness, that counts everyone equally. I think that they,
interestingly, would also have a concern for the welfare of animals,
because Sidgwick does mention animal welfare, as do all the
utilitarians: they’re much more aware of the fact that animals count
than any other ethicists of that era were. He is also very concerned
about looking at the long-term future, emphasising that we should be
concerned for all the moments of our existence and for all the others
who may come after us. He was one of the first to raise the question:
‘If we can affect the size of the population that exists in the future,
what kind of principles should we look at?’ In fact, I think he was
the first explicitly to raise that question, which Derek Parfit and
others have discussed at greater length more recently. I think that in
today’s world he would have been a strong environmentalist. He
would have been appalled at the failure to act on climate change. I
think he also would have wanted us to be more aware about global
poverty. So, I think the world would be a better place if his influence
were more prevalent.
