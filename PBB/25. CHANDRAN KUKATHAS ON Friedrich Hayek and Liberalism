Nigel Warburton, Philosophy Bites Back

CHANDRAN KUKATHAS ON
Friedrich Hayek and Liberalism

David Edmonds: ‘This’, said Margaret Thatcher after becoming leader of
Britain’s Conservative Party, ‘is what we believe’. And she banged a book
down on the table. It was called The Constitution of Liberty, and it was
written by Friedrich Hayek. Hayek, the Nobel Prize-winning economist
and political theorist, was born into an aristocratic family in Vienna, but
left Austria after his doctorate and went on to teach in London, Chicago,
and Freiburg—he’s probably best known for his book, The Road to
Serfdom, written during World War II, a passionate defence of liberalism,
as it faced possible extinction. For a while, Hayek was based at the
London School of Economics—now the academic home of Professor
Chandran Kukathas.

Nigel Warburton: The topic we’re going to focus on is Friedrich Hayek
and liberalism. Many people don’t think of Hayek as a liberal at all: he’s
regarded as the quintessential conservative thinker. Could you explain
what he has to do with liberalism?

Chandran Kukathas: Hayek started his intellectual life as an economist, but
turned his attention to political philosophy late in his career. When he did so
he set out to defend a philosophy of liberalism—this is how he put it himself.
He thought that what was most urgently needed at that time was to counter
what he saw as the malign development of totalitarianism in the regimes of
Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia, and he thought that these ideas were
going to take hold in western democracies. The antidote was to offer a
restatement, a rearticulation of the philosophy of liberalism. That was
basically his research agenda for the next 40 years or so.

NW: So, why do people see him as a conservative?

CK: That’s complicated because the term ‘liberal’ has a different
resonance on the two sides of the Atlantic. In the United States, from
the European point of view, liberalism really means something a bit
closer to socialism. On the European and English side of the divide,
liberalism is something that you would contrast with socialism. So
when Hayek writes about liberalism, his target is really socialism;
whereas in the United States, when people write about liberalism,
their enemy is conservatism. But Hayek himself recognized the
difficulty of the term, and apart from offering a defence of
liberalism, also tried to be quite explicit about the fact that he
repudiated conservatism. The famous postscript of The Constitution
of Liberty, is titled ‘Why I’m Not a Conservative’.

NW: Central to his liberalism is a suspicion of the power of government.

CK: That’s a little bit of the story, but it’s not the whole story,
because Hayek is not quite as hostile to government as people think,
especially if you look at some of his earliest philosophical and
political writings. What he’s concerned to do is not so much criticize
government as to explain what its proper role is. Indeed, he has quite
an extensive role for government, which is one of the reasons why he
drew criticism from libertarians.

But in an early essay, he argues that one of the problems with
twentieth-century liberals was that they took too uncritically the
phrase ‘laissez-faire’, as if laissez-faire would simply solve all
problems. So, he saw his task as to try to articulate what were the
things that were best done by the government, and what should
government stay clear of.

NW: Let’s start there, then. What are the areas within which government
should operate?

CK: Firstly, I would draw a distinction between the earlier and
later Hayek. The Hayek of the 1930s and 40s right up to the Hayek of
1960, when he wrote The Constitution of Liberty, had a much more
extensive role for government than later. But as time went on, he
became more and more sceptical about some of the things that he’d
assigned to government. So, for example, at the early stage he would
have seen the role of government as trying to provide stable
institutions of law, to provide stable institutions of money, to attend
to the provision of various public goods, to be concerned about the
environment. He thought that the government had a role to play in
some sort of provision of education. But later on he became more
sceptical about allowing too much scope for government legislation.
For example, he became concerned that the legislative process itself
was overly infected by particular interests, and so did not really
reflect the government’s concern to act in the interest of all.

He also became concerned about whether government was
capable of providing a sound and stable currency. So, in his later
years, he put forth some quite radical proposals for the
denationalization of money, for example. On the whole, his thought
developed in a more libertarian, almost anarchistic direction. But he
always retained a certain view that there were some things that you
needed government for.

NW: But, in the area of the market, he certainly believed that there were
respects in which spontaneous order could emerge and actually produce
better results than a government overseeing the market.

CK: Yes, he thought that markets would address a great many of the
problems that human beings face. He saw markets as coordinating
mechanisms. The virtue of markets was that they allowed individuals
through the use of their own independent knowledge to coordinate
their different purposes, to achieve ends, and to produce goods that
no planner could satisfactorily do. But he also thought that to work,
markets required certain sorts of institutional structures. Although
some of these institutions would appear spontaneously, it was still
necessary to think hard about how these institutions would work,
what sorts of institutions you need. So, what he was against was the
idea that you could somehow plan outcomes.

At that time, the claims that were made on behalf of socialism
were really quite extensive. So Hayek’s concern then was to try to
say, ‘Well, I don’t think you can achieve this, I don’t think it is
practically possible. But also, if you tried, the human cost would be
enormous.’

NW: Could you outline what his main criticisms of large-scale social
planning were?

CK: Well, here Hayek was building on some important insights of
the Austrian economist, Ludwig von Mises, who wrote a very
important book that came out in 1920 called Socialism. Mises tried
to try to show that, in a socialist economy, economic planning was
impossible because in the absence of market pricing there would not
be signals to tell producers precisely how much they needed to
produce: there were no feedback mechanisms informing people of
what was needed or demanded.

Hayek took this further; what he tried to show is that the nature of
the knowledge problem was even more substantial. The problem
was that you could not even get the faintest idea of what sort of
knowledge was out there. Many socialists had tried to argue that
technology would resolve the planning problem; more and more
powerful computers would allow us to plug in information that we
had about people’s preferences, demands, production resources, and
so on, and somehow come up with conclusions about what is the best
way to allocate resources in society.

What Hayek tried to show was that knowledge was not only so
thoroughly dispersed that it would be difficult to gather and put into
a computer, but also that knowledge was not something that simply
existed independently of institutions. Knowledge was something that
was being generated and disappearing all the time. A lot of
knowledge was of a kind that was transient or fleeting: you may be
the owner of the truck and suddenly you find that someone whose
goods you were planning to deliver doesn’t have these goods,
you’ve got an empty truck. Nowadays, you’d probably put up a
notice on Craigslist saying, ‘going to Birmingham with an empty
truck, all offers taken’. This knowledge is going to disappear in
about two hours. You couldn’t gather it; it would be impossible.
Well, this is how the market operates, Hayek thinks. It’s a matter of
people constantly and spontaneously trying to coordinate their
activities, and Hayek thought this was where the market was at its
most dynamic. Planning was something that would stifle this element
of it to the disadvantage of everyone. What he thought you could do
is plan to have good institutions, but what you couldn’t control was
the outcome of human interaction.

NW: So what does a good institution deliver? Does it deliver freedom—
liberty—as you’d expect from a liberal thinker? Does it deliver equality,
justice? What is the good result we’re seeking to achieve?

CK: The short answer is that it’s not any one thing. If you have good
government, then what you will have is a society in which there is
freedom, in which there is the administration of justice, and in which
there is also a coordination of human purposes such that you have a
measure of prosperity as well as equality. Equality is extremely
important for Hayek, although in his case, not so much equality of
economic outcomes but equality before the law, which he thinks of
as the most important achievement of liberalism.

One of the things Hayek and most liberals are wary of is the idea
that there is some single ideal, or even some cluster of ideals, that a
liberal society or a market society for that matter is supposed to
deliver. The problem is how to coordinate our actions given that we
have so many different purposes, given that we have different values.

NW: What role does he assign to the law?

CK: The law is there to smooth relations among people. It’s there
because in our relations with one another we can come into conflict
—since we have different ends, different purposes, and different
desires. Given that, the problem is how do we figure out a way of
getting along? The law is one mechanism to enable this to happen,
just as the market is a mechanism for enabling us to coordinate our
economic purposes.

NW: What would Hayek say about the fact that markets can actually
deliver severe inequalities of outcome?

CK: On the whole, he’s not really concerned about distributive
outcomes. In fact, he thinks that it’s dangerous to try to engineer
particular sorts of outcomes. But he was concerned that the outcomes
of markets could mean destitution for some people. In spite of his
critique of socialism and the welfare state, he did on the whole
defend institutions such as a welfare minimum to ensure that people
couldn’t fall below a certain point, to ensure that if the market didn’t
provide for some people they would not fall on hard times.

NW: Would it be fair to say, then, that the usual summary of Hayek as a
conservative thinker, the ally of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, is
slightly misleading?

CK: That’s correct. Those two leaders themselves were quite
interested and sympathetic to Hayek’s thinking. But how much he
actually influenced them as opposed to the fact that they came to him
because they were already sympathetic to those ideas, is another
matter. Of course, politicians always pick and choose the ideas that
are going to be suitable for their own purposes. Both those figures
had things on their agenda, and they would draw on Hayek when it
suited their purposes. Hayek was quite happy to accept that. But
there were also issues on which they simply disagreed: Thatcher, for
example, was much more conservative than Hayek.

NW: The way you’ve been talking, it would be hard for me to believe that
you’re not sympathetic to Hayek. Are you a Hayekian?

CK: I’m very sympathetic to Hayek’s ideas, but I always think back
to the first time I heard Hayek in person. I was a student at Oxford, a
dinner had been organized at which Hayek was the guest of honour—
it was at a small Chinese restaurant. Towards the end of the evening,
someone stood up and proposed a toast to Professor Hayek and he of
course had to respond. He got up rather wearily—I think he had had
enough of these sorts of occasions by now—he was in his eighties.
He only said one simple thing: he said thank you very much, and that
he appreciated the gesture. The only thing he wanted to say was that
he hoped that there would never be Hayekians in the world, because
he thought that followers were always a bad idea, and followers
were always worse than the people they followed. Marxists were
much worse than Marx; Keynesians were much worse than Keynes;
and so he really hoped there wouldn’t be any Hayekians. So with
that in mind, I hesitate to call myself a Hayekian, but I have been
very significantly influenced by his thinking.
