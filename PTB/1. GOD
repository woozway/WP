GOD

Does God exist? This is a fundamental question, one which most of
us ask ourselves at some time in our lives. The answer which each
of us gives a ects not only the way we behave, but also how we
understand and interpret the world, and what we expect for the
future. If God exists, then human existence may have a purpose, and
we may even hope for eternal life. If not, then we must create any
meaning in our lives for ourselves: no meaning will be given to
them from outside, and death is probably final.

When philosophers turn their attention to religion they typically
examine the various arguments that have been given for and against
God’s existence. They weigh up the evidence and look closely at
the structure and implications of the arguments. They also examine
concepts such as faith and religious belief to see if they can make
sense of the way people talk about God.

The starting point for most philosophy of religion is a very general
doctrine about the nature of God, known as Theism. This is the
view that one God exists, that he or she is omnipotent (capable of
doing anything), omniscient (knows everything), and supremely
benevolent (all-good). Such a view is held by most Christians, Jews,
and Muslims alike. Here I will focus on the Christian view of God,
though most of the arguments will apply equally to the other
Theistic religions, and some will be relevant to any religion.

But does this God described by Theists actually exist? Can we prove
that he or she does? Should a reasonable person believe that no such
God exists, a position known as atheism? Or is agnosticism, the
suspension of belief (or sitting on the fence, as some people would
describe it), the appropriate reaction? There are many di erent
arguments intended to prove God’s existence. I shall consider the
most important of these in this chapter.

THE DESIGN ARGUMENT
One of the most frequently used arguments for God’s existence is
the Design Argument, sometimes also known as the Teleological
Argument (from the Greek word telos, which means ‘purpose’).
This states that if we look around us at the natural world we can’t
help noticing how everything in it is suited to the function it performs:
everything bears evidence of having been designed. This is supposed
to demonstrate the existence of a Creator. If, for example, we
examine the human eye, we see how its minute parts all t together,
each part cleverly suited to what it was apparently made for: seeing.

Supporters of the Design Argument, such as William Paley
(1743–1805), claim that the complexity and e ciency of natural
objects such as the eye are evidence that they must have been
designed by God. How else could they have come to be as they are?
Just as by looking at a watch we can tell that it was designed by a
watchmaker, so, they argue, we can tell by looking at the eye that
it was designed by some sort of Divine Watchmaker. It is as if God
has deliberately left evidence of his or her existence all around us in
the world.

This is an argument from an e ect to its cause: we look at the e ect
(the watch or the eye), and from examination of it we try to tell
what caused it (a watchmaker or a Divine Watchmaker). It relies on
the idea that a designed object like a watch is in some ways very
similar to a natural object such as the eye. This sort of argument,
based on a similarity between two things, is known as an argument
from analogy. Arguments from analogy rely on the principle that if
two things are similar in some respects they will very likely be
similar in others.

Those who accept the Design Argument tell us that everywhere
we look, particularly in the natural world– whether at trees, cliffs,
animals, the stars, or whatever– we can nd further con rmation
of God’s existence. Because these things are far more ingeniously
constructed than a watch, the Divine Watchmaker must have been
correspondingly more intelligent than the human watchmaker.
Indeed, the Divine Watchmaker must have been so powerful, and so
clever, that it makes sense to assume that it was God as traditionally
understood by Theists.

However, there are strong arguments against the Design Argument,
several of which were raised by the philosopher David Hume (1711–76)
in his posthumously published Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion,
and in section XI of his Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding.

CRITICISMS OF THE DESIGN ARGUMENT
WEAKNESS OF ANALOGY
One objection to the argument just set forth is that it relies on a weak
analogy: it takes for granted that there is a signi cant resemblance
between natural objects and objects which we know to have been
designed. But it is not obvious that, to use the same example again, the
human eye really is like a watch in any important respect. Arguments
from analogy rely on there being a strong similarity between the two
things being compared. If the similarity is weak, then the conclusions
that can be drawn on the basis of the comparison are correspondingly
weak. So, for example, a wrist watch and a pocket watch are su -
ciently similar for us to be able to assume that they were both
designed by watchmakers. But although there is some similarity
between a watch and an eye– they are both intricate and ful l their
particular functions– it is only a vague similarity, and any conclu-
sions based on the analogy will as a result be correspondingly vague.

Against this criticism a Theist might still maintain that it is more
likely that the eye was designed by a supreme being than that it
came about merely by chance.

EVOLUTION
The existence of a Divine Watchmaker is not, however, the only
possible explanation of how it is that animals and plants are so well
adapted to their functions. In particular, Charles Darwin’s (1809–82)
theory of evolution by natural selection, explained in his book The
Origin of Species (1859), gives a widely accepted alternative explanation
of this phenomenon. Darwin showed how, by a process of the
survival of the fittest, those animals and plants best suited to their
environments lived to pass on their characteristics to their o spring.
Later scientists have been able to account for the mechanism of
evolution in terms of inherited genes. This process explains how
such marvellous adaptations to environment as are found in the
animal and plant kingdoms could have occurred, without needing
to introduce the notion of God.

Of course Darwin’s theory of evolution in no way disproves God’s
existence– indeed, many Christians accept it as the best explanation
of how plants, animals, and human beings came to be as they are:
they believe that God created the mechanism of evolution itself.
However, Darwin’s theory does weaken the power of the Design
Argument since it explains the same e ects without any mention of
God as their cause. The existence of such a theory about the
mechanism of biological adaptation prevents the Design Argument
from being a conclusive proof of God’s existence.

LIMITATIONS ON CONCLUSION
Even if, despite the objections mentioned so far, you still nd the
Design Argument convincing, you should notice that it doesn’t prove
the existence of a unique, all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-good
God. Close examination of the argument shows it to be limited in a
number of ways.

First, the argument completely fails to support monotheism– the
view that there is just one God. Even if you accept that the world
and everything in it clearly shows evidence of having been designed,
there is no reason to believe that it was all designed by one God.
Why couldn’t it have been designed by a team of lesser gods working
together? After all, most large-scale, complex human constructions
such as skyscrapers, pyramids, space rockets, and so on, were made
by teams of individuals, so surely if we carry the analogy to its logical
conclusion it will lead us to believe that the world was designed by
a group of gods working together.

Second, the argument doesn’t necessarily support the view that
the Designer (or designers) was all-powerful. It could plausibly be
argued that the universe has a number of‘design faults’: for instance,
the human eye has a tendency to short-sightedness, and to cataracts in
old age– hardly the work of an all-powerful Creator wanting to create
the best world possible. Such observations might lead some people
to think that the Designer of the universe, far from being all-powerful,
was a comparatively weak god or gods, or possibly a young god
experimenting with his or her powers. Maybe the Designer died soon
after creating the universe, allowing it to run down of its own accord.
The Design Argument provides at least as much evidence for these
conclusions as it does for the existence of the God described by
the Theists. So the Design Argument alone cannot prove that the
Theists’ God rather than some other type of God or gods exists.

Finally, on the question of whether the Designer is all-knowing
and all-good, many people find the amount of evil in the world
counts against this conclusion. This evil ranges from human cruelty,
murder, and torture, to the su ering caused by natural disasters
and disease. If, as the Design Argument suggests, we are to look
around us to see the evidence of God’s work, many people will
nd it hard to accept that what they see is the result of a benevolent
Creator. An all-knowing God would know that evil exists; an
all-powerful God would be able to prevent it occurring; and an all-
good God would not want it to exist. But evil continues to occur.
This serious challenge to belief in the Theists’ God has been much
discussed by philosophers. It is known as the Problem of Evil. In a
later section we will examine it in some detail, together with several
attempted solutions to it. Here it should at least make us wary about
claims that the Design Argument provides conclusive evidence for
the existence of a supremely good God.

As can be seen from this discussion, the Design Argument can
only give us, at best, the very limited conclusion that the world and
everything in it was designed by something or someone. To go
beyond this would be to overstep what can logically be concluded
from the argument.

THE FINE TUNING ARGUMENT
Despite the powerful arguments against the Design Argument, some
recent thinkers have tried to defend a variant of it known as the
Anthropic Principle. This is the view that the chance of the world
turning out to be conducive to human survival and development was
so tiny that we can conclude that the world is the work of a divine
architect. On this view, the fact that human beings have evolved and
survived provides us with a proof of God’s existence. God must have
controlled the physical conditions in our universe, and fine-tuned them
to allow just this kind of life form to evolve. This view is bolstered
by scienti c research indicating the limited range of suitable starting
conditions for a universe in which life could develop at all.

CRITICISM OF THE FINE TUNING ARGUMENT
THE LOTTERY OBJECTION
There is a major objection to the argument from Fine Tuning.
Imagine that you have bought a ticket for a national lottery. There
are, perhaps, many millions of tickets, but only one will win. It is
statistically highly unlikely that you will win. But you might. If you
do, however, this doesn’t demonstrate more than your good luck: it
doesn’t follow from the fact that, from amongst all those millions of
losing tickets, your winning ticket was chosen that this must have
been the result of something more than a random selection. You
might, if you are superstitious, read all kinds of signi cance into the
fact that you won the lottery. But anything which is statistically
unlikely still can happen. The mistake that defenders of the Fine
Tuning argument make is to assume that when something happens
which is unlikely, there must be a more plausible explanation of it
than that it arose naturally. Our presence in this part of the universe
can be adequately explained without recourse to supernatural causes.
It is not surprising that we are in a universe where the conditions
were just right for beings of our kind to emerge, since there would
be no chance whatsoever of us emerging elsewhere. So the fact that
we are here cannot be taken as proof of God’s design. Furthermore,
the Fine Tuning argument is also vulnerable to the range of criticisms
of traditional versions of the Design Argument outlined above.

THE FIRST CAUSE ARGUMENT
The Design Argument and its variant the Fine Tuning Argument
are based on direct observation of the world. As such they are what
philosophers call empirical arguments. In contrast, the First Cause
Argument, sometimes known as the Cosmological Argument, relies
only on the empirical fact that the universe exists, not on any
particular facts about what it is like.

The First Cause Argument states that absolutely everything has been
caused by something else prior to it: nothing has just sprung into
existence without a cause. Because we know that the universe
exists, we can safely assume that a whole series of causes and e ects
led to its being as it is. If we follow this series back we will nd an
original cause, the very first cause. This rst cause, so the First
Cause Argument tells us, is God.

However, as with the Design Argument, there are a number of
criticisms of this argument.

CRITICISMS OF THE FIRST CAUSE ARGUMENT
SELF-CONTRADICTORY
The First Cause Argument begins with the assumption that every
single thing was caused by something else, but it then proceeds to
contradict this by saying that God was the very rst cause. It argues
both that there can be no uncaused cause, and that there is one
uncaused cause: God. It invites the question‘And what caused God?’
Someone convinced by the First Cause Argument might object that
they did not mean that everything had a cause, only that everything
except God had a cause. But this is no better. If the series of e ects
and causes is going to stop somewhere, why must it stop at God?
Why couldn’t it stop earlier in the regression, with the appearance
of the universe itself?

NOT A PROOF
The First Cause Argument assumes that e ects and causes could not
possibly go back for ever in what is termed an infinite regress: a never-
ending series going back in time. It assumes that there was a first cause
that gave rise to all other things. But must this really have been so?

If we used a similar argument about the future, then we would
suppose that there would be some final effect, one which would not
be the cause of anything after it. But, although it is indeed difficult
to imagine, it does seem plausible to think of causes and e ects going
on into the future to infinity, just as there is no highest number
because we can always add one to any number which is supposed
to be the highest one. If it is possible to have an in nite series at all,
why then shouldn’t the e ects and causes extend backwards into
the past to infinity?

LIMITATIONS ON CONCLUSION
Even if these two criticisms of the argument can be met, it does not
prove that the first cause is the God described by the Theists. As
with the Design Argument, there are serious limitations on what
can be concluded from the First Cause Argument.

First, it is true that the first cause was probably extremely powerful
in order to create and set in motion the series of causes and e ects
which resulted in the whole universe as we now know it. So there
might be some justi cation for claiming that the argument shows
the existence of a very powerful, if not an all-powerful, God.

But the argument presents no evidence whatsoever for a God who
is either all-knowing or all-good. Neither of these attributes would
be needed by a first cause. And, as with the Design Argument, a
defender of the First Cause Argument would still be left with the
problem of how an all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-good God
could tolerate the amount of evil that there is in the world.

THE ONTOLOGICAL ARGUMENT
The Ontological Argument is very di erent from the previous two
arguments for the existence of God in that it does not rely on evi-
dence at all. The Design Argument, as we have seen, depends on
evidence about the nature of the world and the objects and organisms
in it; the First Cause Argument requires less evidence– it is based
only on the observation that something rather than nothing exists.
The Ontological Argument, however, is an attempt to show that
the existence of God necessarily follows from the de nition of God
as the supreme being. Because this conclusion can be drawn prior to
experience, it is known as an a priori argument.

According to the Ontological Argument, God is de ned as the
most perfect being imaginable; or, in the most famous formulation
of the argument, given by St Anselm (1033–1109), as‘that being
than which nothing greater can be conceived’. One of the aspects
of this perfection or greatness is supposed to be existence. A perfect
being would not be perfect if it did not exist. Consequently, from
the de nition of God it is supposed to follow that he or she
necessarily exists just as it follows from the de nition of a triangle
that the sum of its interior angles will be 180 degrees.

This argument, which has been used by several philosophers,
including René Descartes (1596–1650) in the fifth of his Meditations,
has convinced very few people of God’s existence, but it is not easy
to see precisely what is wrong with it.

CRITICISMS OF THE ONTOLOGICAL ARGUMENT
ABSURD CONSEQUENCES
One common criticism of the Ontological Argument is that it
would seem to allow us to de ne all kinds of things into existence.
For instance, we can quite easily imagine a perfect island, with a
perfect beach, perfect wildlife, and so on, but it obviously does not
follow from this that this perfect island actually exists somewhere.
So, because the Ontological Argument seems to justify such a
ridiculous conclusion, it can easily be seen to be a bad argument.
Either the argument’s structure must be unsound, or else at least
one of its initial assumptions must be false; otherwise it could not
possibly give rise to such obviously absurd consequences.

A defender of the Ontological Argument might well reply to
this objection that, although it is clearly absurd to think that we
can de ne the perfect island into existence, it is not absurd to
think that from the de nition of God it follows that God neces-
sarily exists. This is because perfect islands, or for that matter perfect
cars, perfect days, or whatever, are only perfect examples
of particular kinds of things. But God is a special case: God is
not just a perfect example of a kind, but the most perfect of all
things.

However, even if this implausible argument is accepted, there is a
further criticism of the Ontological Argument which any defender
of it will have to meet. This further criticism was originally made
by Immanuel Kant (1724–1804).

EXISTENCE IS NOT A PROPERTY
A bachelor can be de ned as an unmarried man. Being unmarried is
the essential de ning property of a bachelor. Now, if I were to say
‘bachelors exist’, I would not be giving a further property of
bachelors. Existence is not the same sort of thing as the property
of being unmarried: for anyone to be unmarried they must first
exist, though the concept of a bachelor remains the same whether
or not any bachelors do happen to exist.

If we apply the same thinking to the Ontological Argument, we
see that the mistake it makes is to treat the existence of God as if it
were simply another property, like omniscience, or omnipotence.
But God could not be omniscient or omnipotent without existing,
so by giving a de nition of God at all we are already assuming that he
or she exists. Listing existence as a further essential property of a
perfect being is making the mistake of treating existence as a property
rather than as the precondition of anything having any properties at all.

But what about fictional beings, such as unicorns? Surely we can
talk about the properties of a unicorn, such as having one horn and
four legs, without unicorns actually having to exist. The answer is
that what a sentence like‘Unicorns have one horn’ really means is
‘If unicorns were to exist, they would have one horn’. In other
words,‘Unicorns have one horn’ is really a hypothetical statement.
So the non-existence of unicorns is not a problem for the view that
existence is not a property.

EVIL
Even if the Ontological Argument is accepted, there is still much
evidence that at least one aspect of its conclusion is false. The presence
of evil in the world seems to oppose the idea that God is all-good.
I deal with possible answers to this point in the section on the
Problem of Evil.

KNOWLEDGE, PROOF, AND THE EXISTENCE
OF GOD
The arguments for God’s existence which we have considered so
far have all at times been presented as proofs. They are supposed to
yield knowledge of God’s existence.

Knowledge in this context can be defined as a kind of true, justi ed
belief. If we were to have knowledge that God exists it would have
to be true that God actually does exist. But our belief that God
exists would also have to be justi ed: it would have to be based on
the right sort of evidence. It is possible to have beliefs that are true
but unjusti ed: for example, I may believe that it is Tuesday
because I have looked at what is written on what I believe is
today’s newspaper. But in fact I was looking at an old paper which
just happened to have come out on a Tuesday. Although I believe
that it is Tuesday (which it is), I did not acquire my belief in a
reliable way, since I could just as easily have picked up an old
newspaper which would have convinced me it was Thursday. So I did
not really have knowledge, though I may mistakenly have thought
that I did.

All the arguments for the existence of God that we have examined
so far have been open to a number of objections. Whether these
objections are sound or not is for you to decide. Certainly the
objections should raise doubts about whether or not these arguments
can be considered proofs of God’s existence. But could we perhaps have
knowledge– this type of true, justified belief– that God does not exist?
In other words, are there any arguments which could conclusively
disprove the existence of the God described by the Theists?

There is indeed at least one very strong argument against the
existence of a benevolent God, one which I have already mentioned
as a criticism of the Design, First Cause, and Ontological Arguments.
This is the so-called Problem of Evil.

THE PROBLEM OF EVIL
There is evil in the world: this cannot seriously be denied. Think
only of the Holocaust, of Pol Pot’s massacres in Cambodia, or of
the widespread practice of torture. These are all examples of moral
evil or cruelty: human beings in icting su ering on other human
beings, for whatever reason. Cruelty is also often in icted upon
animals. There is also a di erent kind of evil, known as natural or
metaphysical evil: earthquakes, disease, and famine are examples of
this sort of evil.

Natural evil has natural causes, though it may be worsened by
human incompetence or lack of care.‘Evil’ may not be the most
appropriate word to describe such natural phenomena, which give
rise to human su ering, because the word is usually used to refer to
deliberate cruelty. However, whether we label them‘natural evil’
or choose another name for them, the existence of such things as
disease and natural disaster certainly has to be accounted for if we
are to maintain a belief in a benevolent God. Why would a god who
cares about human beings create childhood leukemia or malaria? Why
would such a god allow earthquakes and tsunamis to take place?

In view of the existence of so much evil, how can anyone seriously
believe in the existence of an all-good God? An all-knowing God
would know that evil exists; an all-powerful God would be able to
prevent it occurring; and an all-good God would not want it to
exist. But evil continues to occur. This is the Problem of Evil: the
problem of explaining how the alleged attributes of God can be
compatible with this undeniable fact of evil. This is the most serious
challenge to belief in the Theists’ God. The Problem of Evil has led
many people to reject belief in God altogether, or at least to revise
their opinion about God’s supposed benevolence, omnipotence, or
omniscience.

Theists have suggested a number of solutions to the Problem of
Evil, three of which we will consider here. Such attempted
explanations of how evil is compatible with the existence of God
are usually known as theodicies.

ATTEMPTED SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEM OF EVIL
SAINTLINESS
Some people have argued that, though the presence of evil in the
world is clearly not a good thing in itself, it is justi ed because it
can lead to greater moral goodness. Without poverty and disease,
for instance, Mother Teresa’s great moral goodness in helping the
needy would not have been possible. Without war, torture, and
cruelty, no saints or heroes could exist. Evil allows the supposedly
greater good of this kind of triumph over human su ering. However,
such a solution is open to at least two objections. First, the degree
and extent of su ering are far greater than would be necessary to
allow saints and heroes to perform their acts of great moral good-
ness. It is extremely difficult to justify the horri c deaths of millions
of people in Nazi concentration camps using this argument.
Besides, much of this su ering goes unnoticed and unrecorded, and
so cannot be explained in this way: in some cases the su ering
individual is the only person capable of moral improvement in such
a situation, and this improvement would be highly unlikely to
occur in cases of extreme pain.

Second, it is not obvious that a world in which great evil exists
would be preferable to one in which there was less evil and as a
result fewer saints and heroes. Indeed, there is something o ensive,
for example, about trying to justify the agony of a young child dying
of an incurable disease by arguing that this allows those witnessing
this to become morally better people. Would an all-good God
really use such methods to aid our moral development?

ARTISTIC ANALOGY
Some people have claimed that there is an analogy between the
world and a work of art. Overall harmony in a piece of music usually
involves discords which are subsequently resolved; a painting typically
has large areas of darker as well as of lighter pigment. In a similar
way, so the argument goes, evil contributes to the overall harmony or
beauty of the world. This view is also open to at least two objections.

First, it is just di cult to believe. For instance, it is hard to
understand how somebody dying in agony on a barbed-wire fence
in no-man’s-land in the Battle of the Somme could be said to have
been contributing to the overall harmony of the world. If the analogy
with a work of art is really the explanation of why God permits so
much evil, then this is almost an admission that evil cannot satis-
factorily be explained since it puts the understanding of evil beyond
a merely human comprehension. It is only from God’s viewpoint
that the harmony could be observed and appreciated. If this is what
it means when Theists say that God is all-good, then it is a very
di erent use of the word‘good’ from our usual one.

Second, a God who allows such su ering for merely aesthetic
purposes– in order to appreciate it in the way one appreciates a
work of art– sounds more like a sadist than the all-good deity
described by Theists. If this is the role su ering plays, then it makes
God uncomfortably close to the psychopath who throws a bomb
into a crowd in order to admire the beautiful patterns created by
the explosion and the blood. For many people this analogy between a
work of art and the world would be more successful as an argument
against God’s benevolence than for it.

THE FREE WILL DEFENCE
By far the most important attempt at a solution to the Problem of
Evil is the Free Will Defence. This is the claim that God has given
human beings free will: the ability to choose for ourselves what to do.
If we did not have free will we would be like robots, or automata,
with no choices of our own. Those who accept the Free Will Defence
argue that it is a necessary consequence of having free will that we
should have the possibility of doing evil; otherwise it would not
genuinely be free will. They tell us that a world in which human
beings have free will which sometimes leads to evil is preferable to
one in which human action is predetermined, one in which we
would be like robots, programmed only to perform good actions.
Indeed, if we were pre-programmed in this way, we could not
even call our actions morally good since moral goodness depends
on having a choice about what we do. Again, there are a number
of objections to this proposed solution.

CRITICISMS OF THE FREE WILL DEFENCE
IT MAKES TWO BASIC ASSUMPTIONS
The main assumption that the Free Will Defence makes is that a
world with free will and the possibility of evil is preferable to a world
of robot-like people who never perform evil actions. But is this
obviously so? Su ering can be so terrible that no doubt many
people, given the choice, would prefer everyone to have been
pre-programmed only to do good, rather than have to undergo
such pain. These pre-programmed beings could even have been
designed so that they believed they had free will even though they
didn’t: they could have had the illusion of free will with all the
bene ts that follow from thinking that they are free, but with none
of the drawbacks.

This hints at a second assumption that the Free Will Defence
makes, namely that we do actually have free will and not just an
illusion of it. Some psychologists believe that we can explain every
decision or choice that an individual makes by referring to some
earlier conditioning that the individual has undergone, so that,
although the individual might feel free, his or her action is in fact
entirely determined by what has happened in the past, and by
genetically transmitted predispositions. We cannot know for certain
that this isn’t actually the case.

However, it should be pointed out in the Free Will Defence’s
favour that most philosophers believe that human beings do have
free will in some sense, and that free will is generally considered
essential to being human.

FREE WILL BUT NO EVIL
If God is omnipotent, then presumably it is within his or her
powers to have created a world in which there was both free will
and yet no evil. In fact such a world is not particularly di cult to
imagine. Although having free will always gives us the possibility of
performing evil, there is no reason why this should ever become an
actuality. It is logically possible that everyone could have had free
will but decided always to shun the evil course of behaviour.

Those who accept the Free Will Defence would probably reply
to this that such a state of a airs would not be genuine free will.
This is open to debate.

GOD COULD INTERVENE
Theists typically believe that God can and does intervene in the
world, primarily by performing miracles. If God intervenes some-
times, why does he or she choose to perform what can seem to a
non-believer relatively minor‘tricks’ such as producing stigmata
(marks on people’s hands, like the nail holes in Christ’s hands) or
changing water into wine? Why didn’t God intervene to prevent
the Holocaust or the whole Second World War or the AIDS
epidemic?

Again, Theists might reply that if God ever intervened then we
would not have genuine free will. But this would be to abandon an
aspect of most Theists’ belief in God, namely that divine intervention
sometimes occurs.

DOESN’T EXPLAIN NATURAL EVIL
A major criticism of the Free Will Defence is that it can at best only
justify the existence of moral evil, evil brought about directly by
human beings. There is no conceivable connection between having
free will and the existence of such natural evil as earthquakes, disease,
volcanic eruptions, and so on, unless one accepts some kind of doc-
trine of the Fall whereby Adam and Eve’s betrayal of God’s trust is
supposed to have brought all the di erent sorts of evil on the
world. The doctrine of the Fall makes human beings responsible for
every form of evil in the world. However, such a doctrine would
only be acceptable to someone who already believed in the existence
of the Judaeo-Christian God.

There are other more plausible explanations of natural evil, one of
which is that the regularity in the laws of nature has a great overall
bene t which outweighs the occasional disasters that it gives rise to.

BENEFICIAL LAWS OF NATURE
Without regularity in nature our world would be mere chaos, and
we would have no way of predicting the results of any of our
actions. If, for instance, footballs only sometimes left our feet
when we kicked them, sometimes simply sticking to them, then we
would have great di culty predicting what was going to happen
on any particular occasion when we went to kick a ball. Lack of
regularity in other aspects of the world might make life itself impos-
sible. Science, as well as everyday life, relies upon there being a
great deal of regularity in nature, similar causes tending to produce
similar e ects.

Some Theists argue that because this regularity is usually bene cial
to us, natural evil is justi ed since it is just an unfortunate side-e ect
of the laws of nature continuing to operate in a regular way. The
overall bene cial e ects of this regularity are supposed to outweigh
the detrimental ones. But this argument is vulnerable in at least
two ways.

First, it does not explain why an omnipotent God couldn’t have
created laws of nature which would never actually lead to any natural
evil. A possible response to this is that even God is bound by the
laws of nature; but this suggests that God is not really omnipotent.

Second, it still fails to explain why God does not intervene to
perform miracles more often. If he or she never intervenes, then, as we
have seen, a major aspect of most Theists’ belief in God is taken away.

THE ARGUMENT FROM MIRACLES
In discussing the Problem of Evil and attempted solutions to it,
I mentioned that Theists usually believe that God has performed
occasional miracles: in the Christian tradition these include the
Resurrection, the feeding of the five thousand, bringing Lazarus
back from the dead, and so on. These were all miracles which
Christ allegedly performed, but it is often claimed by Christianity
and other religions that miracles occur now. Here we shall consider
whether the claim that miracles have occurred could ever provide
su cient evidence for believing in the existence of God.

A miracle can be de ned as some kind of divine intervention in
the normal course of events which involves breaking an established
law of nature. A law of nature is a generalization about the way
certain things behave: for example, weights fall to the ground when
dropped, no one rises from the dead, and so on. Such laws of
nature are based on a large number of observations.

Miracles should at the outset be distinguished from merely
extraordinary occurrences. Someone may try to commit suicide by
jumping off a high bridge. By a freak combination of factors, such
as wind conditions, their clothes acting as a parachute, and so on, they
may– as has happened– survive the fall. Whilst this is extremely
unusual, and might even be described by the newspapers as‘ a
miracle’, it is not a miracle in the sense I am using the term here.
We could give a satisfactory scienti c explanation of how this
individual came to survive: it was only an extraordinary event, not a
miraculous one, since no law of nature was broken, and, as far as
we can tell, no divine intervention was involved. If, however, the
person had jumped from the bridge and had mysteriously bounced
o the river back up on to the bridge, then that would indeed have
been a miracle.

Most religions claim that God has performed miracles, and that
the reports of these miracles should be treated as con rmation that
God exists. However, there are strong arguments against basing a
belief in God on such reported miracles.

HUME ON MIRACLES
David Hume, in Section X of his Enquiry Concerning Human
Understanding, argued that a rational person should never believe a
report that a miracle had actually taken place unless it would be a
greater miracle that the person reporting the miracle was mistaken.
This, he argued, is highly unlikely ever to be so. We should, as a
policy, always believe whatever would be the lesser miracle. In this
statement Hume is deliberately playing on the meaning of‘miracle’.
As we have already seen, a miracle in the strict sense is a transgression
of a law of nature presumed to have been caused by God. However,
when Hume declares that we should believe whatever is the lesser
miracle, he is using the word‘miracle’ in the everyday sense, which
can include something which is merely out of the ordinary.

Although he allowed that miracles might in principle occur,
Hume thought that there had never been a reliable enough report
of a miracle on which to base a belief in God. He used several
powerful arguments to support this view.

MIRACLES ALWAYS IMPROBABLE
Hume first of all analysed the evidence that we have that any par-
ticular law of nature holds. For something to be accepted as a law
of nature– for instance, that no one ever rises from the dead– there
must be the maximum possible amount of evidence con rming it.

A wise person will always base what they believe on the available
evidence. And in the case of any report of a miracle there will
always be more evidence to suggest that it didn’t occur than that it
did. This is just a consequence of miracles involving the breaking of
well-established laws of nature. So, using this argument, a wise
person should always be extremely reluctant to believe a report that a
miracle has occurred. It is always logically possible that someone could
rise from the dead, but there is a great amount of evidence sup-
porting the view that this has never happened. So although we
cannot absolutely rule out the possibility that the Resurrection
occurred, according to Hume, we should be extremely reluctant to
believe that it did.

Hume gave several further arguments to make this conclusion
more convincing.

PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS
Psychological factors can lead people to be self-deceived or even
actually fraudulent about the occurrence of miracles. For instance, it
is a well-observed fact that amazement and wonder are pleasant
emotions. We have a strong tendency to believe highly improbable
things– such as that UFO sightings prove the existence of intelligent
life on Mars, that ghost stories demonstrate the possibility of life
after death, and the like– because of the pleasure that we experi-
ence in entertaining such fantastic beliefs. Similarly we are prone to
believe reports of miracles, since most of us would, secretly or
otherwise, like such reports to be true.

Also it is extremely appealing to think that you have been chosen
to witness a miracle, that you are some kind of prophet. Many
people would enjoy the approval that others give to those who
claim to have witnessed miracles. This can lead them to interpret
merely extraordinary events as miracles revealing God’s presence.
It may even lead them to concoct stories about miraculous events.

RELIGIONS CANCEL OUT
Miracles have been claimed by all the major religions. There is a
similar amount of evidence of a similar kind that miracles claimed
by each of these religions have really happened. Consequently
the Argument from Miracles, if it were reliable, would prove the
existence of the di erent gods of each religion. But clearly these
di erent gods cannot all exist: it can’t be true that there is only
one Christian God and the many Hindu ones. So the miracles claimed
by the di erent religions cancel each other out as proofs of the
existence of a particular God or gods.

The combination of these factors should always make rational
people reluctant to believe reports that a miracle has happened.
A natural explanation, even if improbable in itself, is always more
likely to be appropriate than a miraculous one. Certainly a report of
a miracle could never amount to a proof of God’s existence.

These arguments are not restricted to other people’s reports of
miracles. If we ourselves are in the unusual position of thinking that
we have witnessed a miracle, most of them still apply. We have all
experienced dreams, cases of misremembering things, or of thinking
we have seen things which weren’t really there. In any case in which
we believe we have witnessed a miracle, it is far more likely that our
senses have deceived us than that a miracle has actually occurred. Or
else we may only have witnessed something extraordinary and, due to
the psychological factors mentioned above, thought it was a miracle.

Of course anyone who thinks they have witnessed a miracle
would, rightly, take this experience very seriously. But, because it is so
easy to be mistaken about these things, such an experience should
never count as a conclusive proof of God’s existence.

THE GAMBLER’S ARGUMENT: PASCAL’S WAGER
The arguments for and against the existence of God that we have
examined so far have all been aimed at proving that God does or
doesn’t exist. They have all purported to give us knowledge of his
or her existence or non-existence. The Gambler’s Argument, which is
derived from the writings of the philosopher and mathematician
Blaise Pascal (1623–62), and is usually known as‘Pascal’s Wager’, is
very di erent from these. Its aim is not to provide proof, but rather
to show that a sensible gambler would be well advised to‘bet’ that
God exists.

It begins from the position of an agnostic, that is, someone who
believes that there is not enough evidence to decide whether or not
God exists. An atheist, in contrast, typically believes that there is
conclusive evidence that God does not exist.

The Gambler’s Argument proceeds as follows. Since we do not
know whether or not God exists, we are in much the same position
as a gambler before a race has been run or a card turned. We must
then calculate the odds. But to the agnostic it may seem just as likely
that God exists as that he or she doesn’t. The agnostic’s course of
action is to sit on the fence, not making a decision either way. The
Gambler’s Argument, however, says that the most rational thing to
do is to aim to have a chance of winning as great a prize as possible,
whilst keeping our chance of losing as small as possible: in other
words, we should maximize our possible winnings, and minimize
our possible losses. According to the Gambler’s Argument, the best
way to do this is to believe in God.

There are four possible outcomes. If we bet on the existence of
God and win (i.e. if God does exist), then we gain eternal life– a
great prize. What we lose if we bet on this option and it turns out
that God doesn’t exist is not great when compared with the possibility
of eternal life: we may miss out on certain worldly pleasures, waste
many hours praying, and live our lives under an illusion. However,
if we choose to bet on the option that God doesn’t exist, and we
win (i.e. if God doesn’t exist), then we live a life without illusion
(at least in this respect), and feel free to indulge in the pleasures of
this life without fear of divine punishment. But if we bet on this
option and lose (i.e. if God does exist), then we at least miss the chance
of eternal life, and may even run the risk of eternal damnation.

Pascal argued that, as gamblers faced with these options, the most
rational course of action for us is to believe that God does exist.
This way, if we are correct, we stand to win eternal life. If we
gamble that God exists and are wrong we do not stand to lose so
much as if we choose to believe that God doesn’t exist and are
wrong. So, if we want to maximize our possible gains and minimize
our possible losses, then we ought to believe in God’s existence.

CRITICISMS OF THE GAMBLER’S ARGUMENT
CAN’T DECIDE TO BELIEVE
Even if the Gambler’s Argument is accepted, we are still left with
the problem that it is not possible for us to believe in whatever we
want. We can’t simply decide to believe something. I can’t decide
tomorrow to believe that pigs can fly, that London is the capital of
Egypt, or that an all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-good God
exists. I need to be convinced that these things are so before I can
believe them. But the Gambler’s Argument provides no evidence
whatsoever to convince me that God does exist: it merely tells
me that as a gambler I would be well advised to bring myself to
believe this to be so. But here I am faced with the problem that, in
order to believe anything, I must believe that it is true.

Pascal had a solution to this problem of how to make ourselves
believe that God exists if this goes against our feelings on the matter.
He suggested that the way to do this was to act as if we already
believed that God existed: go to church, say the words of the
appropriate prayers, and so on. He argued that if we gave the out-
ward signs of a belief in God, then very quickly we would develop
the actual beliefs. In other words, there are indirect ways in which
we can deliberately generate beliefs.

INAPPROPRIATE ARGUMENT
To gamble that God does exist because we thereby gain the chance
of everlasting life, and then to trick ourselves into an actual belief in
God because of the prize we win if we are correct, seems an inap-
propriate attitude to take to the question of God’s existence. The
philosopher and psychologist William James (1842–1910) went so
far as to say that if he were in God’s position he would take great
delight in preventing people who believed in him on the basis of
this procedure from going to heaven. The whole procedure seems
insincere, and is entirely motivated by self-interest.

NON-REALISM ABOUT GOD
Non-realism about God provides a controversial alternative to
traditional Theism. Non-realists argue that it is a mistake to think of
God as something existing independently of human beings. The
true meaning of religious language is not to describe some sort of
objectively existing being; rather it is a way of representing to
ourselves the ideal unity of all our moral and spiritual values, and
the claims these values have upon us. In other words, when a non-
realist of this kind claims to believe in God this doesn’t mean that
he or she believes in God as an entity which actually exists in a
separate realm, the sort of God described by traditional Theists.
Instead they mean that they commit themselves to a particular set
of moral and spiritual values, and that the language of religion
provides an especially powerful way of representing these values.
As Don Cupitt (1934–), one of the best-known non-realists, has
put it,‘To speak of God is to speak about the moral and spiritual goals
we ought to be aiming at, and about what we ought to become.’

According to non-realists, those who believe that God exists as
something out there to be discovered like another planet or the
yeti are in the grip of mythological thinking. The true meaning of
religious language, they claim, is to represent to ourselves the
highest human ideals. This explains how different religions came
into existence: they have grown up as an embodiment of different
cultural values, but in a sense they are all part of the same sort
of activity.

CRITICISMS OF NON-REALISM ABOUT GOD
DISGUISED ATHEISM
The main criticism of non-realism about God is that it is a thinly
disguised kind of atheism. To say that God is simply the sum of
human values is tantamount to saying that God as traditionally
conceived does not exist; religious language just provides a useful way
of talking about values in a godless world. This can appear hypo-
critical, since non-realists reject the idea that God has an objective
existence and yet at the same time want to cling to religious language
and ritual. It seems more honest to follow through the consequence of
believing that God doesn’t really exist and become an atheist.

IMPLICATIONS FOR RELIGIOUS DOCTRINE
A second criticism of the non-realist approach to the question of
God’s existence is that it has very serious implications for religious
doctrine. For instance, most Theists believe in the existence of
heaven; but if God doesn’t really exist, then presumably nor does
heaven (nor, for that matter, hell). Similarly, if God does not exist
in a realist sense, it is di cult to see how a plausible account of
miracles could be given. Yet belief in the possibility of miracles is a
central one for many Theists. Adopting a non-realist stance to the
question of God’s existence would involve radical revision of many
basic religious beliefs. This in itself need not undermine the non-realist
approach: if someone is prepared to accept such radical revisions
then they can consistently do so. The point is that the non-realist
view involves a substantial overhaul of basic religious doctrine, an
overhaul that many people would not be prepared to make.

FAITH
All the arguments for God’s existence that we have examined have
been subject to criticisms. These criticisms are not necessarily con-
clusive. You may be able to find counter-criticisms. But if you can’t
find suitable counter-criticisms, does this mean that you should
reject belief in God altogether? Atheists would say that you should.
Agnostics would return a verdict of‘not proven’. Religious believers,
however, might argue that the philosophical approach, weighing up
di erent arguments, is inappropriate. Belief in God, they might say,
is not a matter for abstract intellectual speculation, but rather for
personal commitment. It is a matter of faith, not of the clever
employment of reason.

Faith involves trust. If I’m climbing a mountain and I put my
faith in the strength of my rope, then I trust that it will hold me if
I should lose my footing and fall, though I can’t be absolutely certain
that it will hold me until I put it to the test. For some people, faith
in God is like faith in the strength of the rope: there is no estab-
lished proof that God exists and cares for every individual, but the
believer trusts that God does indeed exist and lives his or her life
accordingly.

An attitude of religious faith is attractive to many people. It makes
the kind of arguments we have been considering irrelevant. Yet at
its most extreme, religious faith can make people completely blind to
the evidence against their views: it can become more like stubbornness
than a rational attitude.

What are the dangers of adopting such an attitude of faith
towards God’s existence if you have an inclination to do so?

THE DANGERS OF FAITH
Faith, as I have described it, is based on insufficient evidence. If there
were sufficient evidence to declare that God exists, then there would
be less need for faith: we would then have knowledge that God
exists. Because there is insufficient evidence to be certain of God’s
existence, there is always the possibility that the faithful are mistaken in
their faith. And, as with the belief that miracles have occurred, there
are a number of psychological factors which can lead people to put
their faith in God.

For instance, the security that comes from believing that an
all-powerful being is looking after us is undeniably attractive. Belief
in life after death is a good antidote to a fear of death. These factors
can be incentives for some to commit themselves to a faith in God.
Of course, this doesn’t necessarily make their faith misplaced, it
simply shows that the causes of their faith may be a combination of
insecurity and wishful thinking.

Also, as Hume argued, human beings get a great deal of pleasure
from the feelings of wonder and amazement that come from
believing in paranormal occurrences. In the case of putting one’s
faith in God, it is important to distinguish a genuine faith from the
pleasure derived from entertaining the belief that God exists.

These psychological factors should make us wary about com-
mitting ourselves to faith in God: it is so easy to be mistaken about
one’s motivation in this area. In the end, each believer must judge
whether or not his or her faith is appropriate and genuine.

DEATH
Most people who believe in the existence of some kind of God also
believe in an afterlife. Some atheists also believe in an afterlife, but
typically they do not. If you believe in an afterlife you have less
reason to fear your own death than if you don’t, provided, of
course, that the afterlife is likely to be a pleasant one and not eternal
damnation. Either way, for those who believe in an afterlife death is
not the end of everything.

IS FEAR OF DEATH IRRATIONAL?
Fear of death is widespread, and belief in God and an afterlife can
be a consolation for those whose lives are unpleasant or painful. Yet
belief in an afterlife might just be wishful thinking. Some philoso-
phers have argued that even if death is completely final we have
nothing to fear. Others have made the case that a finite existence is
preferable to immortality.

Epicurus (341–271 BC) tried to show that we have no reason to
fear death. Fear of death arises from mistakenly imagining that we will
be there after our deaths to mourn our own loss. But when we are
alive, death is absent; and when we are dead, we no longer exist to
be harmed. So either we are alive, and death isn’t harming us; or
we are dead, and then there is nothing to be harmed. Furthermore,
he argued, we don’t usually worry about the eternity of our non-
existence before birth, so we shouldn’t worry in the least about the
eternity of our non-existence after death. His conclusion was that
fear of death is irrational. This, of course, still allows that it may be
perfectly rational to fear the process of dying and the pain that
typically accompanies it.

CRITICISM OF EPICURUS
ASSUMES ANY AFTERLIFE WON’T BE BAD
Epicurus assumes that any afterlife won’t be bad. Both his argu-
ments are arguments about the fear of our own non-existence. They
do not take account of fear of what might happen to us following
death. If there is an afterlife, there might be aspects of that afterlife
that it would be completely rational to fear, the possibility of
spending eternity being boiled in sulphur and being prodded by
little devils with tridents, for instance. Another possibility that has
been seriously suggested is that immortality would end up being
tedious, something that we might have very good reason to fear.

WOULD IMMORTALITY BE TEDIOUS?
Many human activities gain their meaning from the fact that they
are unrepeatable. We make choices, decisions that shape the people
we become. Our joy in the immediate experience of the pattern of
light and shade in a forest partly comes from the fact that it is a
transient e ect that we may never see again. Our mortality makes
us value the present because we may not have a future. The pattern
of our choices and the things that happen to us give us our personal
history. Yet if we are going to live for ever after death, this source
of meaning won’t be there for us. There will always be time to
do everything. Bernard Williams (1929–2003) argued that such
immortality would be tedious and ultimately meaningless. It is
the fact of death and its finality that gives our lives much of the
meaning that they have.

CRITICISM OF THE TEDIUM OF IMMORTALITY
ASSUMES THE AFTERLIFE IS LIKE THE PRESENT LIFE
The lack of meaning and boredom that would go with having time to
do anything and everything are a projection of what we experience
in this world to the next. Yet, presumably a benevolent God
wouldn’t want us to be bored in the afterlife, so we can be con-
dent if such a being exists that the afterlife will be very di erent
from life on Earth in ways that we cannot imagine.

If this is so, however, it raises the question of whether any such
afterlife is a life that we carry on living, since what we are is so
shaped by our finite existence in time and the knowledge that we
will die. In what sense is such a life for me since what I am has been
so bound up with the decisions that I have made about how I spend
my limited time? If the response to this question is that this is
something that God will take care of, then this is a recourse to faith
again, with the possibility that this faith might be misplaced.

CONCLUSION
In this chapter we have considered most of the traditional arguments
for and against the existence of God. We have seen that there are
serious criticisms which Theists need to meet if they are to maintain
a belief in an omnipotent, omniscient, supremely benevolent God.
One way of meeting many of these criticisms would be to revise
the qualities usually attributed to God: perhaps God is not entirely
benevolent, or perhaps there are limits to his or her power, or
knowledge. To do so would be to reject the traditional account
of God. But for many people this would be a more acceptable
solution than rejecting belief in God altogether.
